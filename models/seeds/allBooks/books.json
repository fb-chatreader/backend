    "summary": "What kind of chief executive drops out of high school and then spends years dumpster-diving, shoplifting and working mediocre jobs to pay the bills? A truly kick-ass one like author Sophia Amoruso, who used her colorful life experience to start one of the most successful fashion companies in the past decade. In #GIRLBOSS, Amoruso explains how she turned a vintage clothes hobby into a multimillion-dollar business. In these blinks, you’ll learn how she also used her creativity and her business savvy to launch a worldwide movement to connect young women. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: what hitchhiking teaches you about entrepreneurship; how you need to forget everything you learned in school to truly succeed; and why working at a big chain bookstore can make you the world’s best boss. When you were growing up, did your parents tell you that if you failed in school, you’d fail in life? Well, it’s not true. Some people do well at school; others don’t. Either way, good grades won’t determine whether you’ll achieve success later in life. After all, there are many different kinds of people in the world, and each person has different skills. Being successful is matter of figuring out what you’re good at and parlaying that skill into a career. Once you identify your special talent, this will free you to focus on what you enjoy and what you’re good at. This way, you can perform to the best of your ability and in tandem, succeed. That’s the story of Sophia Amoruso. She had a knack for negotiating discounts on coveted vintage clothing and then reselling items for a healthy profit. The venture started as a hobby, but the thrill and challenge eventually drove her to establish her own clothing empire. The author was simply being herself and doing what she was good at; that’s what made her successful. But she was able to find this path as she had accepted her own strengths and weakness. Accepting yourself is incredibly important – because as mentioned above, people are different. There are extroverts and introverts, and each type has an environment that works best for them. Extroverts flourish when they’re interacting with others. This personality type is well-suited for working on Wall Street, for example, where you have to push and shove and shout to make trades. But such an environment would be a nightmare for an introvert. In Amoruso’s case, her inner introvert blossomed thanks to social media. She built customer relationships online, where she could interact with fans in a measured, non-aggressive way. If you want to achieve greatness, it’s important to realize that no matter how motivated you are, there’s no straight line to success. And in fact, trying to follow a straight path will only limit you, as you might miss out on new and surprising opportunities. Imagine an aspiring astronaut who has spent years with his head buried in books. During his first zero-gravity flight test, he discovers he has severe motion sickness. Even though he spent his whole life training to be an astronaut, his laser-like focus prevented him from finding the right path that would truly suit his abilities. So choose a more serpentine path – yet know that you might have to take a few odd jobs along the way. Some people resist this, but you’ll see that you can learn something new with each opportunity. Although she was an anti-capitalist, Amoruso once took a job working at a large commercial bookstore chain. She started with a bad attitude and carried a lot of prejudices, but ultimately acquired customer service skills that would later set her own business apart. There are unexpected advantages to following an unconventional path. There is also, of course, the other side of the coin: failure. Failure can happen to anyone – so don’t fear it, own it! Chances are, if you aren’t succeeding at something, then what you’re doing isn’t fueling your inner passion. If it were, it would be effortless. That’s exactly what Amoruso discovered. Prior to starting her own business, she’d had her fair share of failures, dozens of jobs from which she was either fired or quit. At the time, she thought the reason things weren’t working out was because she was lazy. But the truth was that these jobs simply didn’t work for her. Yet when she was collecting clothes and bargaining and selling her creations on eBay, Amoruso could work all hours of the day without even once checking the clock. Once you’ve figured out what you love to do, how can you succeed in doing it? Start by becoming an expert in your field, and learn everything you can. If you’re in the business world, the best way to gain expertise is through experience. For Amoruso, this meant building her own company from scratch. In the beginning, she did everything herself: bought the clothes, packed and shipped them to customers. This ensured that she knew the whole business, inside and out. And so when items didn’t sell, she would adjust her marketing approach, through changing text or images on her website. By being so adaptable, she gained lots of experience and knowledge about what exactly her customers wanted. During the first few years, Amoruso also styled all her own fashion shoots. In the process, she did much more than sell clothing; she offered young women an immersive, inspiring fashion experience. She did this by choosing approachable, cool-looking models and dressed them in a quirky way that her customers loved and wanted to copy. Ultimately, customers didn’t just connect with her product, they also connected with each other, creating a powerful community. This approach gave her fledgling business a major advantage over other vintage shops on eBay, many of which had dull photos and poor marketing. So when she moved from eBay to her own site, her community followed. And their loyalty didn’t end there. Her customers loved NastyGal so much they shared their find with friends. This word-of-mouth marketing helped Amoruso grow her customer base. By working hard and building experience, the author developed expert insight into what her customers wanted. But what really helped her succeed was that she was able to put all this expertise into building an influential, loyal community. There are no stupid questions. But there are questions that go unanswered because they were never asked in the first place. So if you want to do something, you have to start by asking for it. Think about it this way: If you don’t tell people what you want, you’re never going to get it. It’s simple! You have to vocalize your hopes and dreams if you want people to help you achieve them. Amoruso learned this one day when she was trapped on the side of the road during a heavy rainstorm. Although she didn’t have a dollar on her, she took a chance and held out her thumb to hitch a ride from a Greyhound bus. The bus stopped, and the driver let her ride for free. This lesson hit her like a lightening bolt: Ask, and you shall recieve. Another important aspect of getting what you want is trusting your intuition. That means knowing which rules are okay to break. After all, to build a successful business you have to be creative and break some rules. It’s not about seeing the world in black and white, but rather in shades of gray. Being more flexible in your thinking will also prevent you from worrying so much about whether you’re doing something right. Instead, break some rules, cross some lines – and make something new. Yet not all rules are meant to be broken. Amoruso learned this when she was busted for shoplifting. After paying a fine to avoid jail time, the author was humbled by her experience. She decided that the only rules worth breaking were arbitrary ones, like wearing last year’s shoes to a fashion party. So when it comes to breaking rules, don’t waste time by breaking the law. Unless you really feel like learning a different lesson in jail. So we’ve learned that there are some rules you can break, and others you can’t. But there’s also the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Basically, this means if you put positivity out into the universe, you’ll receive the same in return. And what’s more, by focusing on what you like rather than what you don’t, you’ll free up energy that you can then pour back into your passions. Amoruso was tempted to ignore this advice when a friend copied the entire NastyGal website and tried to pass it off as her own. If the author had dwelled on this incident and stayed angry, it only would have helped her competitor, who would have used the opportunity to steal customers who weren’t getting the great customer service they were used to. But the author didn’t cave. She didn’t waste time plotting revenge, and instead rededicated herself to her business. As Amoruso learned, you can’t worry about what others are doing or thinking. If you spend your time obsessed with others, you’ll neglect the innovation and creativity inside of you. High school was miserable for the author. She was always paralyzed with fear by what others thought of her. So she left school early. Ultimately, she realized that worrying about what others think of you only wastes time and energy. So to stay focused and ignore the noise, create sigils. These are small words that are encoded with your goals. To make a sigil, jot down your goal in a word or short phrase and then slice it up, removing or combining whatever letters you want until you’re left with a pictogram no one else understands. These private codes can empower you to think positively about your dreams and stay motivated. Now that you know to stay positive and be true to yourself, how do you apply these skills to your entrepreneurial goals? The next blinks will show you how. When we’re children, creativity comes from paint sets, crayons and paper dress patterns. But as adults, we learn that problem-solving too is inherently creative. And when you combine creativity with business, you can set yourself apart. A creative entrepreneurial approach relies on questioning everything; in doing so, you create options for your business. Accepting the status quo will only limit you. For example, NastyGal does not heed the fashion-industry standard of thin, flat-chested models. The company rather established a reputation for creatively dressing different body shapes and marketing its products to women with curves. This innovative approach to styling wasn’t just a creative choice; for NastyGal, it was also a smart business decision that helped generate revenue. However, creative people sometimes get so swept up in the more imaginative aspects of their work that they ignore the more practical business side. It’s important to balance the two. While the author enjoyed thinking about the font on her website and the photographs she used to showcase her products, she also devoted plenty of energy and attention to acquiring and retaining customers. She always considered the shopping experience from her customer’s point of view, while making sure the aesthetics were consistent and unique across the site. Through this, she connected her entrepreneurial side with her more creative talents. Creative people can often be especially effective at marketing, so think of focusing your energies here. It’s a way of tapping your inner artist while also growing your business. Some people think that just because they’re a stylist (or some other creative type) that they can’t also be a businessperson. Thinking this way is negative, and almost guarantees that you will fail. As an entrepreneur, it’s important to choose the right team of employees and investors. But how? The best sort of team to work with is honest, hard-working and loyal. The author learned this one year when the NastyGal’s warehouse chief quit during the crucial Black Friday shopping period, leaving the warehouse in the lurch. Yet a number of motivated employees jumped in to help. They packed boxes, fulfilled orders and made sure the whole operation ran smoothly. They went above and beyond their job descriptions to make sure the company didn’t miss any customer orders during a critical time. For a CEO, a staff like this is a dream. Knowing that you can count on employees makes it easier to sleep at night. And meanwhile, as you and your team are hard at work, make sure your investors are supporting your efforts, and not undermining them. Investors are there to help you grow your dreams, not impose their own. As Amoruso personally experienced, some investors can be bullies. One potential investor, for example, asked the company’s male senior executives whether the author, as a woman, had trouble managing money. His small-mindedness was totally out of sync at a company like NastyGal. Especially one built from the ground up by a woman who’d never even taken out a business loan. Eventually, the author found investors who understood that she was starting a movement, not just a fluffy site for women to waste money. In the end, it’s important that you hold on to your principles and refuse to compromise, just for financial gain. Certain decisions might seem appealing in the short-term, but they’ll only cause problems in the long run. You know how some people have a glow? It’s all about confidence; when you feel good in your own skin, you look good too. This holds true both on a personal level and on a business level. If you know what you are as a company, you’ll be able to feel comfortable and confident following your own path. Otherwise, you’ll just get distracted by every new trend that springs up in your industry. With NastyGal, the author learned that it’s important to represent a business persona as a kind of girl who can talk to anyone, even a stranger. Maybe it would be more “cool” to seem aloof, as some competing brands do, but that kind of unfriendliness hints more instead to a lack of confidence. And as we all know, you can’t buy confidence. Sure, great clothes can help, but only if you have the smarts to back them up. This means listening when others are speaking and having the courage to form your own opinions. It also means knowing when to delegate a decision to someone with more expertise or experience. Never insist that you know everything, as it will only alienate. Instead, remain humble and confident. If you follow these suggestions, you’ll be naturally attractive to everyone you meet. And if you pair that with a fantastic dress? You’ll blow them away. The key message in this book: Becoming a successful entrepreneur isn’t about doing well in school, it’s about figuring out what you really love and letting your passion drive you. So if you want to succeed, ask for what you want and find a way to connect your entrepreneurial side with your creative talents. Most importantly, be confident! Actionable advice: Create a sigil, or a small word encoded with your goals. Lost sight of your goals and need a boost to get back on track? Write down one of your dreams in a word or short phrase and then literally slice it up, removing or combining whatever letters you want until you’re left with a pictogram no one else can understand. This small, private code will empower you to think positively about your dreams and stay motivated. Suggested further reading: Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office by Lois P.

    "title": "A First-Rate Madness",
    "author": "Nassir Ghaemi",
    "summary": "Mental health issues don’t get cast in the best light. Despite progress in recent years, a certain stigma still surrounds them. It means people who have experiences with psychiatric illnesses are often unwilling to speak out. That’s unfortunate and, as far as Nassir Ghaemi is concerned, things don’t have to be that way. His approach is plain. If we look to the past, we can see that many of the world’s greatest leaders had mental health issues. If we accept and elevate that tendency, we can find a way to celebrate what can be the positive consequences of psychiatric illness. In the past, this taboo has meant that we preferred to support the representatives and leaders who seemed the most “normal.” But having depression or bipolar disorder, for example, may be an advantage when serving in office. As you’ll see in these blinks, some of the most impactful leaders in the world’s history personally experienced mental health issues. By looking at these leaders’ behavior, we can shed some light on the relationship between mental health and political leadership, challenging some of our deep-seated prejudices about this topic. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how hyperthymic personality disorder may have prevented nuclear war; why Tony Blair wasn’t as monomaniacal as he’s often portrayed; and into what surprising profession the prejudice against mental health reaches. Mental illness is serious. In its most extreme forms, it can be devastating for those who have it and their loved ones. Furthermore, a social taboo still surrounds mental illness. That may explain why some people experiencing mental illness are ashamed and try to hide it. However, the author believes that some forms of mental illness involve abilities that are otherwise inaccessible to the rest of the population. Specifically, the author has two mental illnesses in mind: major depressive disorder – commonly called depression – and bipolar disorder. They each foster important character traits. For instance, let’s consider someone who’s faced depression. Depression is a disorder that affects the mood and leads to feelings of sadness. It can also reduce motivation and interest in the world. However, it often means that someone who experiences it is more empathic than average since he’ll have experience and understanding of sadness. People who’ve not suffered from depression might be able to conceive of the experience of severe depression, but it’s not the same as having been through it. And if you’ve managed to come through it, then you may have a better grasp of the struggles of the human experience. Bipolar disorder is somewhat different. People who have it may rapidly oscillate in their moods between mania and depression. It can make them more spontaneous. However, those high levels of energy and heightened moods are balanced with deep lows of depression. Also – and we’ll return to these in later blinks – this means bipolar-disorder personalities often look at things from non-standard perspectives. They are able to imagine creative solutions to problems that someone who hasn’t experienced bipolar disorder would find hard to conceive. Both of these disorders also occur in “milder” forms. Dysthymic personality disorder is associated with depressive types, while hyperthymic personality disorder corresponds with bipolar disorder. People with dysthymic personalities lead their lives in a constant state of mild depression, which may culminate in several depressive episodes over the course of a lifetime. Dysthymic personalities are often empathic and deep thinkers. Hyperthymic personalities are often bursting with energy and creativity. They are charming and without fear. They are, essentially, in a constant state of mild mania. Now that we’ve gotten an overview of these disorders, let’s look at some of the most influential leaders of recent decades with dysthymic and hyperthymic personalities. In all likelihood, few people would suspect that two leaders who inspired – and continue to inspire – hope in millions of people were depressive characters. The author, Ghaemi, believes Mahatma Gandhi was a dysthymic personality, while Martin Luther King Jr. experienced at least three episodes of severe depression. Both of these leaders initially suffered periods of depression in childhood, which set a trend into adulthood. As it happens, both King and Gandhi attempted suicide at young ages. When Gandhi was a teenager, he deliberately ate some poisonous seeds with a friend. His rationale was that he wasn’t able to care properly for his elderly father. He felt guilty. As for King, he twice jumped out of a window when he was 12. King’s friend, the psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint, explained this behavior as merely an impulsive reaction to the death of King's grandmother. However, the author is firmly of the belief that these were real suicide attempts. The author sees similar behavior patterns in these two leaders’ later years. Apparently, depression was either triggered or exacerbated by the pressure in their lives. After all, both led rights movements that were faced with huge counter-reactions. When you think about it, then, these leaders probably felt great responsibility for their followers and were frustrated that obstacles seemed unsurpassable. Empathy can be observed as a neurological phenomenon – for example, when we see another person being abused, our brains react as though we were the ones on the receiving end of the abuse. It’s known as the mirror neuron system and has been seen in experiments on macaques. As we saw in the last blink, depression strengthens empathy. A study of college students showed that depression lets people feel what others feel more intensely, even when they’re not in a depressive episode. The author sees a link with King and Gandhi’s politics here, interpreting their politics as a form of “radical empathy.” In other words, both leaders advocated for love and understanding; opponents were not to be hated. The connection is clear for the author. These two leaders set about resolving conflict through non-violent means, but it was an approach that drew upon non-normative world views shaped by mental illness. In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain stood before the House of Commons to make an announcement. He would travel to Germany to meet Hitler in an attempt to convince him of the unnecessariness of war. MPs jumped up and cheered at the plan. But Winston Churchill remained seated, despite others rebuking him for not joining in. Churchill had his reasons. In 1930, long before anyone else in British government came to the same conclusion, Churchill had recognized the Nazis’ threat. They were a danger to world peace. In the author's professional opinion, Churchill likely had type II bipolar disorder. This resulted in several manic and depressive phases. Therefore, in the author’s eyes, Churchill’s depressive experience meant he was able to discern situations realistically. In comparison, his mentally healthy colleagues' optimism was misplaced. The thirty-fifth president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, is also an interesting figure. For the author, JFK exemplifies hyperthymic personality disorder. Simply put then, he was a hyperactive and creative risk-taker – with a sex drive to match. This was particularly in evidence during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev sent Russian nuclear missiles to Cuba to goad Kennedy into a pre-emptive strike – with atomic weapons. But Kennedy held firm. He ignored the advice of everyone around him. By doing so, he averted nuclear disaster. Other leaders who might not have had Kennedy’s experience with mental health struggles would probably have acted differently. No doubt they would have shared the natural impulse common among Kennedy’s advisers and ordered a preemptive attack. Adolf Hitler is another world leader worth considering when thinking about mental health. The author is certain that Hitler had bipolar disorder. But what really caused the evils he leveled on the world was his vile ideology mixed with an overreliance on methamphetamines. Certainly, Hitler suffered from bouts of mania and depression during his childhood. It’s thanks to his friend August Kubizek that we know this. Hitler had always had an aggressively megalomaniacal streak, but it was as a leader capable of manipulating the masses that he found his feet. The author even argues that his demagoguery might have been facilitated by his personality disorder. It’s also worth remembering that Hitler's aggressive and maniacal behavior went into overdrive from 1937 onward. That’s when his doctor started prescribing him methamphetamines. It’s quite possible that Hitler’s prolonged use of methamphetamines heightened his mental instability. Consequently, over time he became less and less likely to listen to the advice given to him by subordinates. His outbursts of violent rage also became more frequent. It’s fairly common for journalists and political commentators to start blaming politicians’ mental health when they don’t like their decisions and actions. That was very much the case with forty-third US President George W. Bush and Tony Blair, the UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007. Many people thought that their political decisions were indicative of mental instability. But as far as the author is concerned, their thought processes were fairly typical for mentally healthy minds. After 9/11, both leaders felt their countries were threatened. They wanted to act. It’s now clear that this impulse led them to invade Iraq on evidence that later proved extremely dubious. Let’s run a thought experiment here. What if these leaders had either hyperthymia or bipolar personalities? Both of these disorders are closely associated with higher creativity. Therefore, we may speculate that such leaders would have been able to see the unfolding situation from multiple perspectives. Such a leader might well have realized that the evidence was too insubstantial to support an invasion. He would have found another way forward, probably one inconceivable to less creative, mentally healthy types. Just think of Kennedy's response during the Cuban Missile Crisis for a comparison. Bush and Blair’s next move was also typical for the mentally healthy. Once their decision had been made, they found themselves unable to change course. They were simply unwilling to see that their assessment of the situation in Iraq had been wrong and that  the evidence on which they based their arguments for invasion was insubstantial. Even once it was clear that they hadn’t been successful, they refused to budge. The author is therefore of the opinion that Bush and Blair chose to keep troops in Iraq instead of acknowledging their mistakes. Such stubbornness is typical of those who are mentally healthy. So Bush and Blair were hardly exceptional – characteristically, most people just don’t like admitting they have ever been wrong. This thought experiment just goes to show that had the United Kingdom and the United States had leaders with more experience of mental illness, then the whole world might ultimately have benefited. In a hypothetical world, had Kennedy been president after 9/11 there would have been no Iraq invasion. Or, had there been an invasion, troops wouldn’t have been stationed there long once it was clear an error had been made. Despite the author’s sympathetic portrayal of mental illness, the fact remains that mental illness remains a taboo subject. There’s clear evidence that we, as a society, are scared of mental illness. A 2004 study published in the Psychiatric Bulletin showed that even medical professionals were prejudiced against people diagnosed with mental illnesses. This situation makes it incredibly difficult for someone faced with mental illness. It also makes it very tricky for non-sufferers to get a clear perspective on it. Specifically, the continuing stigma surrounding mental illness means we’re unable to see its upsides. The first thing we could do is simply acknowledge and accept that past world leaders weren’t always mentally healthy. That doesn’t mean we have to rewrite history. It’s just another layer of knowledge contributing to our picture of the past. Mentally ill people have contributed to make the world a better place. The examples we’ve looked at in these blinks barely scratch the surface. The author has also analyzed other renowned figures. For instance, Ted Turner, a pioneer of 24-hour cable news and the founder of CNN, experienced mental illness, as did President Abraham Lincoln. Turner displayed a hyperthymic personality type, while Lincoln was dysthymic. We should accept, then, that mental health isn’t just a question of “abnormal” types contrasted with seemingly normative behavior. That approach is typical of people who consider themselves mentally fit and distance themselves from anything that is marked as different. Once we’ve accepted that beloved historical figures were mentally unwell and started de-stigmatizing mental health, we can move onto the next step. In this changed atmosphere, more people will doubtless seek diagnosis and help. No longer will diagnosis be something to be ashamed of, but rather something with appreciable qualities. That analysis seemed true to the author as he wrote this book during the presidency of the forty-fourth US president, “No drama Obama”, as he is often known. At the time, an ideal president seemed to be someone who was balanced and “middle-of-the-road” – psychologically as well as politically. For the author, here’s where the rub lies. That sort of president might be effective in peaceful times, but what kind of leader is needed when times are rockier? To his mind, what’s needed is someone who can think differently, someone who’s an asset because of the mental health issues he’s experienced. Think of Churchill in World War Two or JFK in the teeth of the Cold War – the leaders you need in times of crisis. The key message in these blinks: Mental illness is not something of which to be ashamed. Although it’s true that living with a mental illness can be difficult, exhausting and upsetting for those affected and their loved ones, there is an upside. History shows us that some of the greatest world leaders were effective and unique because of their histories of mental health issues. It was precisely what was “wrong” with them that made them successful. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content! Just drop an email to remember@blinkist.com with the title of this book as the subject line and share your thoughts! What to read next: Shrinks, by Jeffrey A. Lieberman, Ogi Ogas. As you’ve seen in these blinks, psychiatry and its history are fascinating. Psychiatry has developed over time, contributing to our understanding in both the medical and social sciences. In our blinks to Shrinks, you’ll learn the story of psychiatry’s astonishing development. It’s taken 300 years, but we’ve come a long way. From the discipline’s crude and brutal past methods based on strange and shocking therapies through to its much improved modern iteration, these blinks have an astonishing story to tell.",

    "title": "A Team of Leaders",
    "author": "Paul Gustavson and Stewart Liff",
    "summary": "Anyone whose workweek is a haze of boredom won’t be surprised by this statistic: As much as $550 billion is lost per year in the US thanks to the low productivity of employees. The sad truth is that many employees feel completely disengaged from their workplace. They don’t feel motivated to do any more than the bare minimum required of them by their bosses. But if building a successful company is your goal, the bare minimum won’t cut it. You need employees who love and take responsibility for their work, and who seek their own approaches to making the company better – without your having to reward them with bonuses. In other words, you need a team of leaders. These blinks explain some quick and easy ways to encourage your employees to be more self-sufficient, as well as to stir up new inspiration and ideas at the office. In these blinks, you’ll discover why your team should constantly be learning new things; how to improve the design of your office; and one way to ensure your whole office is united by good purposes. Imagine you’re at the office and it’s midday. After 4 hours of typing and staring at a computer screen, how do you feel? In all likelihood, you’re bored stiff. You probably have moments when you’d like to forsake your computer and incite your coworkers to join you in revolutionizing the office. You’d like to be part of a team, not a hierarchy. You want to be a member of a team of leaders. But, as in most offices, your boss has all the decision-making power. What do you do? Well, your workplace may simply be in the first of five stages in the team development model. Stage one is that hierarchical model we’re used to; there’s one leader and a team of subordinates following orders. So how do you move past that stage? First, it’s important to know what the next stage looks like. Imagine an organization that’s agreed to strive toward developing a team of leaders. There’d no longer by one executive adjudicating on all work-related issues. Rather, every member of the team would have an equal say. This is the stage during which change really begins. The following stages are just the ideal consequences of that initial shift. Stage three, for instance, is when new leaders begin thinking about creating and taking responsibility for their own team, perhaps by recruiting new members. In stage four, the transition continues as more and more team members step up to the plate and take on leadership roles. For instance, instead of waiting for an assignment from your management, you’d approach HR yourself, learn the ropes and start selecting candidates to fill open positions. By stage five, the goal of completely shared leadership is realized, and each employee is filled with a greater sense of engagement. Because everyone now knows how to recruit people according to the company’s processes, each team is able to self-manage. Hold on – design? That verb might seem a little out of place here. We’re talking about businesses, not Eames chairs, right? Well, design actually has a major influence on many aspects of an organization, too. To get a better sense of this, consider the following questions: How many members does your team have? How should you implement interview procedures? How do you define a company’s mission? Fundamentally, these are all questions of design. So, then, what’s the ultimate goal of design? Simple: uniting people with a shared sense of purpose. We’d all want our job to be meaningful, to have a positive impact on the world: knowing that our work has meaning gives us more energy and more fulfillment. For example, when asked what they do, you want your employees answering purposefully, like “I improve the usability of a website!” instead of “I just fix bugs.” When they don’t feel connected to a higher purpose or believe their work has meaning, they’ll start channeling energy away from work. In addition to each individual’s sense of higher purpose, the team of leaders will thrive as a whole when united under a clearly communicated mission, such as “We support American veterans.” But a truly ingenious way of giving your team drive is to implement a team value creation model. This is an approach where your team operates as a mini-business, by providing team members with the incentive to access more information and a higher level of inside knowledge. Being your own mini-business boss, you might have insights into financial data – balance sheets, say – that allows you to track your team’s performance and engage them with it. This increased employee engagement will not only boost their satisfaction; it’ll boost customer satisfaction, too. How? See, customers usually benefit when an organization functions at a high level. When employees are more productive and better able to respond and update quickly, customers will want in on the action. So we now know that every leader in your team should have her own purpose. However, it’s also vital that these purposes allow team members to work with, not against, each other. In other words, you must achieve alignment among your team members. Alignment is how your team and its elements work together. To get a better idea of what alignment looks like, let’s consider an unaligned team. An organization says that they’re shifting focus to improving the quality of their products. But little attention is given to improving quality, and the focus remains on maximizing productivity. At management meetings, the focus is on the quantity of work, not the quality. And at the end of the year, bonuses are awarded to the teams that performed best, including one who scored, out of all the company’s teams, second-lowest in quality but highest in productivity. This unaligned situation only confirmed the employees’ suspicions that management didn’t really care about quality. The company’s senior executives eventually realized their mistake, but they had lost the employees’ trust and it took many years to make up for it. So, how to avoid this? By creating alignment. Take the above example. The management should’ve aligned the teams toward making higher quality products: That means considering which principles would guide the teams’ focus toward improving quality, which strategies would improve quality, which specific projects or technologies were needed to optimize quality and which rewards would entice teams to produce at a higher quality. If everyone had striven for quality, all design and behavioral incentives would’ve been in accordance in the team. And that would’ve meant that everyone was working toward the same goal: shared success. You’ve probably heard that old saying “knowledge is power.” It’s more than just a cliché. In fact, it’s incredibly relevant when it comes to how your team functions. Every organization has organizational knowledge, that is, the sum of the knowledge belonging to each member within it. Organizational knowledge can also be broken down into key knowledge, which tells us how to create value for the customer; codifiable knowledge, referring to facts and routines in the company; and tacit knowledge, or beliefs and expertise. Let’s take a closer look at why organizational knowledge is vital, and how it works. Imagine you work in a call center with two other people, whom we’ll call Anton and Berta. Anton and Berta have key knowledge, but what happens when Anton and Berta are sick, and you receive a call from a customer named Tom, whose credit card has been stolen? Somewhere in your company handbook there’ll be a section on credit cards: codifiable knowledge that might help Tom. But nobody told you where to find it. And, if you’re unable to contact Anton and get his advice, your tacit knowledge – that you’re 99 percent sure Tom’s money is safe – is insufficient, and probably won’t make Tom feel any better, and he definitely won’t think too highly of your company. Clearly, there’s something wrong with this model. So instead of each team member hoarding a specific kind of knowledge, the goal should be for tacit, codifiable and key knowledge to be equally accessible to each team member in your company. How can you ensure this? The best way is to facilitate learning. Structured learning methods, like manuals, customer research and videos, help everyone access codifiable knowledge. On the other hand, unstructured learning methods, like storytelling, role-playing or personnel rotation, increase the exchange of tacit knowledge because experiences get shared. Have you ever had the unfortunate experience of working in a labyrinth of office cubicles under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting? Many of us have, and it’s not the way it should be. A working space should double as a leader’s place, an environment that honors both your company’s mission and your customers’ feelings. To create a space that fosters a team of leaders, we’ll need something a little more powerful than interior decorating. It’s called visual management. So where do we begin? The first thing to consider is how to optimize the workplace so that ideas and inspirations can be exchanged. Rather than having separate rooms for each team member, why not create an open, yet close-knit layout. It could also help to have charts on the walls displaying current problems and possible solutions. Additionally, whiteboards illustrating the progress of individual projects will make team members feel appreciated and meaningful. In this way, visual management can boost the alignment of a team, too. A clever use of space will also allow you to send powerful messages to your customers. Displays outlining your mission can send positive signals: “This is how we perform and we like it!” And, even just a hand written sign displaying customer feedback makes every customer feel that they’re both welcomed and respected. The key message in this book: Your organization is just five steps away from becoming a team of leaders. Savvy team design, sharing of knowledge and strong visual management will smooth your transition to an aligned and enthusiastic team, united under a shared purpose. Actionable advice: Remember why you do, what you do! If you’ve ever felt demotivated, just take a step back and reflect on how your individual contribution matters, not just to your team, but to the greater good that your company serves. Even if it doesn’t feel like it, your activities are meaningful, appreciated and important. Channeling these thoughts will keep you energized, happy and on track.

    "title": "Adapt",
    "author": "Tim Harford",
    "summary": "Our governments are ineffective and clumsy. Our leaders have inflated egos. The market is a volatile place where ideas appear to sink or swim arbitrarily. It makes sense, then, that we’re bombarded with strategies on how to save the world, our business or ourselves. In reality, however, solutions to the complex problems of our world cannot be reduced to a simple “How To” guide. As Tim Harford’s best-selling Adapt shows, the most effective way to solve any problem is not by planning – it’s by experimenting. With these and more insights, Adapt suggests a great many ways to make oneself resilient against the kind of failure that stops you in your tracks. After reading these blinks, you’ll find out why rules designed to reduce fossil fuel usage actually ended up increasing it; discover why Winston Churchill was wrong about the Spitfire; and find out why one company allows its existing employees to choose the new hire. What’s the difference between the survival rate of biological organisms and that of companies? Not much, as it happens. No matter how competent companies and leaders appear, most of them fail to survive in the long term. In an analysis of the fossil record, economist Paul Ormerod found that the extinction rate of species over a time period of 500 million years matched the extinction rate of companies (albeit on a shorter timescale). To understand why only certain companies survived, Ormerod built a mathematical model of corporate evolution. In this model, Ormerod gave some companies random strategies; some a small advantage over these strategies; and made some of them perfect planners, able to use their knowledge of other companies to maximize their advantage. It turned out there was no overlap between the results of this managed model and a model that represented the actual company extinction rate. In other words, the survival of companies is not due to success or failure in strategic planning. This was also shown in another study, where economic historian Leslie Hannah tracked the world’s largest companies from 1912 onwards. In 1912, US Steel was the market leader, with over 200,000 employees. However, by the 1990s, the company was not even in the top 500. Although some of the companies studied did prosper over the decades – like Shell and General Electric – most of them vanished. And these forgotten companies were, in fact, the Googles and Walmarts of their time. So, since companies frequently appear and vanish, predictions about any company’s future must be treated with suspicion – even when they’re made by so-called experts. Over the course of 20 years, psychologist Philip Tetlock asked 300 experts for their forecasts of a variety of future events. These experts included diplomats, political scientists and economists, many with PhDs. Yet most of their predictions never came true – especially those concerning Russia’s political development from the Cold War to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Therefore, because we can’t predict whether or not a company (or any endeavor) will succeed or fail, it’s crucial that we learn to be resilient against inevitable failures. The following blinks will show you how to accomplish this. It might seem counterintuitive, but our most trusted organizational structures – such as the top-down model – continue to make a great number of mistakes. Why? The hierarchy for top-down decision-making effectively silences the dissenting opinions of experts – opinions that would help organizations to learn from their mistakes. The top-down model consists of three things: a high-level view compiled from all available information; an absolute chain of command; and a unified team sharing a unanimous vision. Top-down organizations’ propensity for making mistakes is especially clear in the army. During the second Gulf War in Iraq, for example, military knowledge acquired on the ground often had no influence on government policy. For example, one US army general demanded more troops, while another advised the United States to win over, rather than eliminate, the low- and mid-level employees of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime. But Donald Rumsfeld and his advisers ignored this feedback and the military experts were overruled by the politicians. Though Rumsfeld – who was near the top of the hierarchy – may have had a broad strategy in mind, his refusal to consider the dissenting opinions of experts on the ground harmed the American mission in Iraq. Chaos broke out. In contrast to a centralized, distant authority, the generals on the ground were able to make better decisions because they could capitalize on local knowledge. Once it was clear that America was facing failure in Iraq due to an untameable insurgent uprising, the politicians changed their strategy: train the Iraqi army, then return home. What they didn’t take into account, though, was that the complex mix of stakeholders in Iraq – Sunni, Shia, American, etc. – made it difficult to halt ethnically charged violence. However, there were a few individuals on the ground who ignored the official strategy and achieved results in their own way. One was H. R. McMaster, an American colonel who’d arrived in dangerous Tal Afar in 2004 and taught troops to interact with the locals. McMaster’s actions resulted in cooperation between citizens and troops, which helped to accomplish the common goal of driving insurgents out of the city. The world is a complex place. Our modern economy, for example, depends on an intricate network of global supply chains, to the extent that, say, a Brazilian logger doesn’t know whether the trees he fells will be used to make a table or a guitar. Even apparently small issues – economic and otherwise – are far more complex than you might first think. One postgraduate student found this out for himself when he attempted to build a toaster from scratch. As he embarked on the project, he realized that sourcing the necessary materials was no simple task. He had to collect iron ore from an old mine in Wales; employ electrolysis to get copper from polluted water; scavenge plastic from a rubbish tip; and melt down commemorative coins for nickel. In the end, after all that work, not only did the device merely warm bread, but it was also a health hazard. Such complexity entails progress via a series of failures. Only people who adapt succeed. Take the engineer Peter Palchinsky. In the 1920s, Palchinsky was hired to advise on grandiose Soviet projects like the Lenin Dam, which was intended to be the world’s largest hydroelectric structure. From the outset, Palchinsky had several criticisms, all of them related to the lack of potential for adaptation. First, there was not enough variation in the plans to take into account other means of energy production. Second, these experiments were not tested first on a scale small enough to be survivable should things go wrong. And third, the leadership ignored feedback that would have helped them to select solutions from mistakes. Despite Palchinsky’s criticisms, Stalin wanted to build as quickly as possible, so he overlooked the problems. Ultimately, the dam was a failure both as a feat of engineering and economically. Ten thousand farmers were resettled to accommodate it, and its laborers suffered appallingly. This highlights a common mistake that many of us make. We often have a false sense of control or knowledge when in reality the situation is complex. Fortunately, we can help to manage such problems by using a trial-and-error, adaptive method. In the following blinks, we’ll look at the way in which the evolutionary principles of variation, survivability and selection underpin success in the modern world. Often, a solution to a complex problem is achieved by experimenting, and testing out many different design variations. In the 1920s, no one realized the military potential of fighter planes – even the British, who didn’t believe that bombers could be stopped by them. A decade later, however, the British Air Ministry requested designs for a new fighter aircraft. At first, none of the companies competing for the contract impressed them. But one of the firms returned with a new aircraft: the Spitfire. Despite many doubts, including those of Winston Churchill, the plane was eventually commissioned as an “interesting experiment.” Ultimately, the Spitfire was an incredible success: it was capable of diving at nearly twice the speed of existing planes, and was agile enough to fight off the Luftwaffe, stopping the Nazi invasion. So, how do we encourage more innovation like this? There are two effective ways to accomplish that goal. The first is patenting. Patents stimulate innovation by giving inventors a monopoly on the use of their idea, so they have a chance to profit personally. The second approach is even more effective: to award specific, goal-oriented prizes to researchers, which encourage the boffins to compete with one another. These prizes are awarded to people or teams that accomplish a particular goal. Both the prize money and the competitors are often funded by philanthropists who want to expand their possibilities for profit in a new market. In 2004, for example, the Ansari X Prize awarded $10 million to the first team to fly a private airplane into space. There were 12 competitors, one funded by a town’s coffee shop. The winner was the “White Knight,” an airplane that was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Although it was a strange-looking contraption, it was able to reach the brink of space. As this example suggests, important breakthroughs, such as private spaceflight, are likely to be accomplished in a much shorter time with research prizes than with patents. Picture a slice of Swiss cheese. Imagine that this slice of cheese represents one layer of safety in a system, and that its holes are points of vulnerability. By stacking many of these slices on top of each other, any clear path through the cheese would be blocked, right? Though it might seem logical, this is not a surefire way to eliminate accidents. In fact, certain safety measures actually create new ways for failures to propagate through a complicated system. Take financial instruments such as Credit Default Swaps (CDS). These were created to allow banks to offload the risk of their loans not being repaid. For example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would repay JP Morgan for any losses it incurred from its loan to Exxon. This freed the bank to take on more risky business, meaning that networks of previously unconnected companies and institutions became entwined in the same complex deals. The effect of this is “tight coupling,” which can lead to a rapid, domino-like collapse of the system. Therefore, when one company collapses, it pulls others down with it – as happened with Lehman Brothers, whose disintegration ultimately led to the financial crisis in 2007/2008. So, how can we improve our ability to survive such failures? Improved survivability requires simplified systems, loosened interactions and contingency plans. Let’s look at the financial system again. One way to increase its safety would be to establish solid contingency plans in the event of bankruptcies. Regulators could mandate that banks with complex operations have to retain a large amount of capital as a “cushion.” Another method is for large banks to split into two – one part with utility functions like ATM cash and savings accounts, and another exclusively for speculative banking, such as trading derivatives. This, however, overlooks the complexity of finance, as some of the speculative side – for instance, venture capital – is responsible for funding a lot of innovation, like start-ups. As this shows, a complex world will produce many errors that we can’t eliminate, so a balance must be struck between risk and innovation. In searching for the source of any given problem, we must learn to distinguish actual causes from ostensible ones. Let’s take randomized trials as an example. Randomized trials place subjects into groups at random and give each group a different solution or treatment to be tested. These trials are effective because they help us to distinguish between a problem’s apparent cause and its actual one. Many such trials have taken place within foreign development aid. To test the hypothesis that textbooks improve test scores, one Dutch charity in Kenya delivered textbooks to a random selection of schools. Surprisingly, textbooks had very little effect on the students’ scores. Then, the same charity gave the schoolchildren a treatment against intestinal worms. While worms weren’t expected to have an influence on learning and academic performance, this program was actually more successful than the textbook experiment, because it reduced the number of absences due to illness. However, certain problems seem impossible to solve using randomized testing. Yet, even then, there are still ways to draw useful insights about a problem’s causes. These intractable problems are known as fundamentally unidentified questions – or FUQs. Since such problems have a complex mix of causes, it’s very difficult to pinpoint a single cause to test. It may also be impossible to measure such causes until after the fact, like the role of carbon dioxide emissions in climate change. The same is true in measuring corruption. Take learner drivers in India. Researchers approached several learners, promising some of them cash for passing their test, while subsidizing the lessons of others. After their test, the researchers surprised the drivers with a second, independent test. Compared with the learners who’d had their lessons subsidized, those who’d received the cash prize were more likely to have passed their initial test. However, they were less likely to be able to drive sufficiently well in the second test. Why? It turned out that those learners who won the cash prize had bribed the examiners! This type of experiment serves as an identification strategy: a way for us to see what can cause FUQs (such as corruption and bribery). We all want to help the environment. Sometimes, though, the initiatives we create to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels can turn out to be bad for the planet. In 2003, a UK council ruled that any mid- or large-scale development must have the ability to produce, on site, at least ten percent of the energy required by the building. The problem was that the council didn’t stipulate that this renewable energy had to be used! Another problem with the rule was the specification that the energy be created on site: clearly, a wind turbine placed on top of a building in a crowded area is less effective than one positioned on a nearby hill. A similar situation has developed in the United States, where, in 1975, standards were introduced to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles. However, because there were fewer regulations for light trucks, manufacturers created the “sports utility vehicle” (SUV). This bore enough of a resemblance to a light truck to convince regulators it should be subjected to the same standards of fuel efficiency. The result was that the efficiency of vehicles sold in the United States actually declined between 1988 and 2003. A more fruitful experiment that could help to reduce carbon emissions is a carbon tax, as this would guide commerce toward cheaper, more energy-efficient products. Much of what we consider to be environmentally friendly is actually not. If you live in the United Kingdom, it may seem more ethical to buy locally grown tomatoes than Spanish imports. Yet the locally grown produce actually results in greater carbon dioxide emissions. Why? Growing tomatoes in Britain requires heated greenhouses, whereas in Spain, they grow in direct sunlight. Even accounting for their transportation to the United Kingdom, Spanish tomatoes use less fossil fuel. A better way to reduce carbon emissions is to impose a $50 tax on every ton of carbon emitted by fossil fuels. This would raise the current market price, incentivizing us to drive less or use less electricity, and would encourage us to choose renewable energy sources What do the U2 plane, which photographed the Russian missiles in Cuba, the Blackbird, the fastest plane in the world, and radar-immune stealth planes have in common? They were all developed within the experimental “Skunk Works” division of the defence firm Lockheed. Such safe havens, or cultures of experimentation within companies, encourage greater innovation. In companies that have safe havens, unconventional ideas can gestate without the stifling influence of company politics. A famous example is Google, which allows its engineers to use 20 percent of their contracted time to pursue any project that interests them. The successes come through approval from fellow engineers. And while 80 percent of the projects have failed – Google Wave, for instance, which was voted one of the worst tech products of 2009 – a massive 50 percent of Google’s current products come from this project time, such as Gmail and Adsense. The decentralization of authority implicit in granting employees autonomy encourages a culture of trust and a free exchange of ideas. Companies such as Whole Foods Market and Timpson give workers an unusual amount of autonomy. Whole Foods teams, for example, give potential employees a four-week trial period before staff vote on whether to hire them or not. If at least two thirds vote yes, it doesn’t matter what the manager votes. And in every Timpson store, old cash registers are used in place of electronic point-of-sale machines, so that head office has less control. In fact, staff are even given £500, which they can use in certain situations – like helping customers out if they can’t afford to pay, or gifting cash to shoppers who have been disappointed with a purchase. Timpson has also instituted peer monitoring, where employees are responsible for each other’s problems, regardless of rank. An employee who makes a mistake, whether by accident or not, can be identified and the situation can be quickly rectified – a type of whistleblowing that’s encouraged by the company. In 2002, the ballet and musical Movin’ Out premiered in Chicago. It was critically panned. As the production was due to begin its Broadway run in three months, its choreographer Twyla Tharp was distraught. As we’ll see, the way Tharp dealt with this very public failure was inspiring. Our brains often stand in the way of our success, trapping us in behavior that stops us from growing. How? First, failure usually leads to denial. For example, certain prosecuting attorneys whose convictions were proved wrong by DNA testing concocted wild theories to deny any miscarriage of justice. In much the same way, Tharp could have dismissed the views of her critics. Second, we can throw more resources after our losses, hoping that they disappear. Even some professional poker players let their emotions override their rationality, and make aggressive bets to win back the amount they have lost. Third, we have a tendency to see the past as better than it actually was, interpreting old failures as successes. In a similar way, Tharp could have decided afterward that she’d planned all along to make a piece so avant-garde that the mass-media critics actually validated it with their scorn. However, with the support of friends and family, we can distinguish our mistakes from our self-worth and find the strength to move on from failure. This group of close allies – our validation squad – provide vital constructive criticism. Tharp’s validation squad picked out the most valid criticism of Movin’ Out for her to work on. In response, Tharp got up early, and rehearsed and improvised like there was no tomorrow. She also made changes to the characters, cut lines and kept morale among the actors high. Once it reached Broadway, Movin’ Out became an award-winning success. The key message in this book: We cannot expect to understand the world, plan with confidence or avoid failure. Instead, we must try out many things, prepare for many failures, ensure we can survive them and be able to learn from them. Actionable advice: Exploit parallelism to increase your chances of success. If you want to expand your social circle, join as many different clubs or meet-ups as you can, and not just the ones you think will be most helpful. Often the options we consider to have less potential actually turn out to be unexpectedly fruitful. We just won’t know unless we try lots of things out within a short space of time.

    "title": "Adaptability",
    "author": "Max McKeown",
    "summary": "What do Allied defense departments battling Nazi Germany in the Second World War, the creators of the iconic Mini Cooper and Starbucks have in common? In a word, adaptability – the ability to change with the times and piggyback on technological and social changes to achieve success. Adaptability is a skill that’s becoming indispensable in today’s frenetic world of business. Markets and consumer tastes are fickle, and nothing is as likely to land you in hot water as complacency. That’s something business strategist Max McKeown knows a thing or two about from his work with clients like Microsoft and Sony, who’ve mastered the art of anticipating the future and changing course accordingly. But don’t just take his word for it. In these blinks, we’ll analyze adaptability in action everywhere from a small Italian village battling post-financial crisis austerity measures, to the boardroom of a multinational coffee chain and the post-war British car industry. Along the way, you’ll find out why Ford turned down a US government bailout proposal in 2008; how Netflix almost came unstuck by pushing adaptability too hard; and why it sometimes takes a radical to do the right thing. In 2009, American golf star Tiger Woods’s position in the sport’s global rankings took a nosedive. By 2011 he’d slipped from number one to 58th place. It was an odd sight, especially since Woods had been known for his incredible consistency since bursting onto the scene in 1996. So what went wrong? Well, it was a sign of the golfing god’s mortality. Life is unpredictable, and even the most successful people can’t always dodge the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. It turned out that Woods’s on-field performance problems had roots in his personal life. In 2009, the media ran a story about him crashing his car outside his house. Neighbors told reporters they’d seen his wife chasing after him with a golf club in her hands. Rumors of substance abuse and infidelity began circulating and major sponsors including Gatorade and Gillette dropped their formerly prized sponsee. Woods didn’t let any of that get to him, however. In fact, he demonstrated just how important adaptability is when you’re faced with setbacks. He continued working hard, even as his stats slipped, and learned how to deal with the media pressure he was under. His perseverance paid off. By March 2013, he was back at the top of world golf rankings. That makes Woods a poster boy for what the author calls, “High adaptability, high achievement people,” or HAHAs for short. That’s a pretty fitting acronym: HAHAs are people who can laugh in the face of adversity and, over time, claw their way back to the top. What sets them apart is their ability to focus on solutions rather than problems. They look on the bright side of life even as things seem to be falling apart around them, and they remain determined to achieve their goals. They’re also typically unafraid to ask for help and reach out to people who can support them in their struggle to reassert themselves. But these blinks aren’t just about golf. Now that we’ve seen what adaptability looks like in practice, let’s take a look at how it works in business contexts. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the US government offered to bail out car manufacturing giant Ford. Despite being up to its eyeballs in debt and looking like it might go under any day, the company ultimately turned down the proposal. There was a good reason for this refusal. Chairman Bill Ford was convinced that companies that fail to adapt fail, period. Sure, an injection of government cash might have solved Ford’s short-term liquidity issues, but it wouldn’t have gotten to the root of the problem – its longstanding failure to adapt to the new realities of the automobile market. The company’s board of directors and its managers decided on an alternative strategy and hatched a plan they called “The Way Forward.” At the heart of this roadmap was a reappraisal of Ford’s relationship with the environment, an issue it had long sidestepped. If the carmaker wanted to remain relevant to American consumers, it would have to move toward their views on environmental matters. What followed was a pretty radical overhaul. Ford downsized by around 25 percent and implemented a system to produce cars more quickly. Most importantly, it shifted to manufacturing smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. The carmaker dodged a bullet, but the company almost left it too late. A better idea than waiting it out and hoping for the best would’ve been to take a leaf out of Toyota’s book. The Japanese corporation is a master at adapting to changing market conditions, a characteristic that allowed it to increase its share of the global car market from 7.3 percent in 1995 to 15 percent in 2005. So what’s the secret of its success? Well, the company has a solid reputation for quality products, but what really sets it apart is its constant search for improvements that satisfy changing consumer preferences. This allowed the company to stay ahead of the curve and anticipate changes in the market long before competitors like Ford saw them coming. To take just a couple of examples, Toyota was already developing low-emission cars in 1992 and hybrid petrol and electricity-powered vehicles in 1995! In the summer of 2011, the Italian government was facing financial issues. Deciding to cut back on expenditures, it introduced a reform to incorporate villages with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants into larger administrative units headed by a single mayor. But one small village called Filettino resisted these measures. It understood that adaptability sometimes means swimming against the current. As far as the villagers were concerned, reacting to new developments didn’t mean rushing into old reforms or embracing change for change’s sake. In their view, one way of adapting was to defend the status quo, and that’s precisely what the mayor of Filettino decided to do. Defying the government, he declared the village’s independence and issued its own currency. It was called the fiorito, meaning ‘flowering’ in Italian – a reference to the settlement’s belief that it would continue to flourish. The village looked to the past for inspiration, harking back to the age before unification when Italy was ruled by many small city-states, kingdoms and principalities. In the end, its act of resistance preserved Filettino’s independence and sense of community. Headstrong Italian villagers aren’t the only beneficiaries of swimming against the current, however. Bucking trends and following one’s own path has also helped a number of companies thrive. Take Levi Strauss as an example. Manufacturing jeans is traditionally a resource-intensive operation. The finishing process alone requires around ten separate washes and gallons of water. If the jeans have a special pattern or a fade effect, that requirement increases even further. That was accepted as a given until the American firm decided to shake things up. Rather than simply going along with the idea that the only thing that matters in business is generating profits, Levi Strauss began factoring environmental considerations into their calculations. Soon enough the company had figured out a way of finishing jeans without using any water at all. By using stones to soften the fabric and rinsing them with a special type of resin, the company cut its water consumption by an incredible 96 percent! It was a regular day in New York in 1985 when Pedro Bach-y-Rita, a Spanish teacher who’d lived a happy and successful life in the city for many years, suddenly collapsed. He’d suffered a massive stroke and was left paralyzed. The doctors treating Bach-y-Rita claimed there was nothing they could do for him. But they were wrong. What they had underestimated was how adaptable humans are. Both of Bach-y-Rita’s sons were in medical school when their father fell ill. Unhappy with his doctors’ diagnoses, they decided to physically re-educate him from scratch, as though he were a baby. The first task they set themselves was teaching him to crawl using kneepads and the support of a wall. Once he’d mastered that, they began setting more difficult tasks like catching balls, which were designed to train his motor systems. Bach-y-Rita made remarkable progress under their supervision. He was soon sitting and, a little later, walking. Astonishingly, within a year he was back at work teaching Spanish at the City College of New York, where he remained until his retirement. So how did Bach-y-Rita regain control over his basic motor functions despite the serious brain damage he’d suffered during his stroke? It comes down to the plasticity of the human brain. Essentially, the undamaged parts of his brain took control of the damaged areas. Bach-y-Rita’s son Paul returned to medical school after helping his father. He later became one of the first scientists to verify the theory of neural plasticity – the idea that the human brain’s capacities and functions aren’t set in stone but can adapt and change. In one experiment, Paul demonstrated that blindfolded participants were able to catch balls thanks to a head-mounted camera which relayed images to their brains through sensory receptors on their tongues. That’s a shining example of how different neural pathways and neurons in the brain can adapt and tackle new tasks, like interpreting images. When people first fail at a task, they tend to lower their expectations and claim that at least they learned something from their mistakes. The crucial question, though, is what past failures teach us: Do we learn how to fail, or how to improve so we don’t fail again? Adaptability is, in large part, the art of learning from mistakes – ideally, the mistakes of others! Take the British automobile industry. In the 1950s, virtually every carmaker was set on developing ever more powerful – and fuel-guzzling – vehicles. They were so fixated on this goal that they overlooked a massive segment of the market: young, urban and environmentally-minded people. The advantage thus passed to German competitors who were churning out popular, compact microcars like the Messerschmitt KR200. As a result, British brands were being crowded out altogether. Did that make them change their approach? Hardly. There was, however, one notable exception: a small team of auto engineers at the British Motor Company headed by designer Sir Alec Issigonis. Observing their peers’ stubborn refusal to change with the times, the team decided to spearhead the production of a new style of car – the iconic Mini marketed by Morris Mini-Minor. Learning from the mistakes of others and adapting to new consumer preferences quickly led to success. Over the following decades, the British Motor Company went on to sell over five million Minis. That said, you can take learning from mistakes too far, as PepsiCo found out in 2009 when it developed a new brand image for Tropicana orange juice. When the company’s massive marketing campaign backfired and sales plummeted by 20 percent, PepsiCo panicked. Realizing that the branding made the product look anonymous and cheap rather than promoting awareness of its quality, they scrambled back to square one. Instead of making a few minor tweaks and fixing the mistake, they reverted to the old branding. The upshot? They blew $33 million to change absolutely nothing! In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the shutdown of all weapons development research programs expected to take longer than six months to reach completion. It was a costly miscalculation for Germany. Why? Because experimentation is the cornerstone of effective adaptation. The mistake would haunt Nazi Germany as the tide gradually turned against it in the Second World War. While German scientists were shackled to short-term targets, their Allied counterparts were given free rein to experiment with new weapon technologies for as long as they pleased. When defense scientist William Butement came up with an idea to develop a proximity fuse, for example, he was encouraged to delve deeper. A proximity fuse is a useful piece of gadgetry if you’re in the middle of a shooting war. A bomb fitted with the fuse’s radar technology will only detonate when it’s sufficiently close to its targets. Older bomb types, on the other hand, used standard timers that often exploded long before – or after – they’d reached their targets. Needless to say, the bombs with the proximity fuses did the most damage. Crafting the perfect proximity fuse took time and dedication, and it was only after years of experimentation with prototypes that the finished article was ready for deployment. It came just in the nick of time. In 1944, a German counteroffensive caught the Allies off guard and the outcome of the Battle of the Bulge hung in the balance. Lucky that they had the perfect weapon to beat back the onslaught: artillery units equipped with lethally accurate proximity fuse shells. Experimentation also has its uses in the metaphorical war between businesses. Take Apple, a company that has long been synonymous with a culture of experimentation. When its new products meet a negative reception, it shelves them and gets to work on a superior alternative. You may or may not remember Apple’s first handheld computer – the clunky, error-prone Newton. The Newton crashed and burned and Apple responded by going back to the drawing board. The result? Its designers used the prototype to develop the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Learning to drive is thrilling. The world suddenly becomes broader as exciting new possibilities come into focus. But you have to be careful. It’s easy to get carried away and put your foot down. That’s when things go wrong and you find yourself at risk. The same thing happens to businesses when they push too hard: the wheels come off and they crash. Take Netflix. The company understood that the future of movie watching was streaming before any of its competitors, and it steamed ahead. What was the problem, then? It was too quick for its subscribers, who were still satisfied with the old offer which allowed them to rent DVDs and stream for $9.99 a month. In 2011, Netflix decided to push its customers and split their offering into two separate components: rentals and streaming, now priced at $7.99 each – a pretty hefty price hike for people who wanted to continue using both services. The decision didn’t go down well. Netflix hemorrhaged a million subscribers and the value of its shares fell by 25 percent. The service did eventually recover, of course, but if it hadn’t been so hasty it would have achieved its current success much sooner. Failing to anticipate changes in the market is even more damaging, however, as Blockbuster found out. Founded in 1985, the movie rental business quickly grew over the following decades. By 2008, it had thousands of stores across the US. But despite its dominant position in the market, it was caught entirely unawares by the streaming revolution. Even worse, it failed to launch its own streaming service while Netflix began establishing itself. That would have been simple enough – after all, Blockbuster held all the aces: it was a household name with a large customer base and plenty of capital. But Blockbuster wasn’t nimble enough to adapt to new realities. It continued focusing on customer experience in its bricks-and-mortar stores even after a new CEO was hired in 2007. By 2010, the writing was on the wall. Blockbuster declared bankruptcy and was gobbled up by the American TV company Dish Network. It’s easy to look good when the economy’s booming and you’re backed by a reputation built up over decades. But success can breed complacency. The result of taking your eye off the ball? You lose sight of your goals. Take Starbucks. Everything had been plain sailing for decades when it hit the rocks in 2007. The coffee chain’s chairman Howard Schultz had an idea about what had gone wrong: its dominant position had incubated an arrogant outlook and the company had stopped taking care of its customers. He was right. Formerly loyal patrons weren’t happy and had started going elsewhere in search of their coffee fix. That same year, Starbucks closed over 900 stores and fired 1,000 of its employees. That was the end of the growth policy championed by the company’s CEO between 2002 and 2007, Jim Donald, who had become obsessed with opening more and more stores. The mad rush to expand had resulted in Starbucks losing touch with its founding values. In the end, Starbucks scraped through this rough patch. So how did it turn things around? Well, it had a leader who was prepared to push through radical reforms: Howard Schultz. One of the first things he did after taking charge was to close 7,000 Starbucks stores in the US and give every barista extra training to help them up their coffee game. When a test revealed that McDonald’s had better-tasting coffee than Starbucks, Schultz introduced new roasting and grinding processes. None of that was rocket science. Schultz simply understood that a coffee chain has to do two things to retain its customers’ loyalty: prepare a great cup of joe and offer a selection of delicious cakes and pastries. But sometimes it takes a radical visionary to do the commonsensical thing. By 2010, his policy had paid off. Starbucks had recovered and its revenue increased to $10.7 billion! That just goes to show how important adaptability is when you’re struggling to get ahead or just treading water. While you shouldn’t rush change, it’s worth keeping an open mind, experimenting and seeing what incremental changes you can make to improve your situation. The key message in these blinks: Adaptability is all about looking ahead, reading the signs and using the prevailing winds to chart your course. Once you’ve mastered that art, you can plan ahead and avoid being caught off guard by sudden changes. That’s especially true in business. The most successful companies consistently demonstrate an ability to change with the times, experiment with new solutions and adapt themselves to customers’ changing desires and needs. Actionable advice: Believe in the impossible. What stops us adapting? Well, nothing throttles innovation like the belief that some things are simply impossible. Take it from American biologist George Church. He was convinced he could design a machine that could decode the entire human genome. Ignoring the naysayers, Church pressed ahead with his vision and constructed his device. While the procedure initially cost a staggering $3 billion, Church managed to reduce the price to just $5,000 over the years. Today, there’s a real chance that it might become affordable enough to be integrated into routine medical testing, opening up the possibility of all sorts of medical breakthroughs! Got feedback?

    "title": "Attitude Reflects Leadership",
    "author": "Leo Hamblin",
    "summary": "We’ve all had bosses who, far from encouraging you to do your work, prefer to do it all themselves. When you did get a chance to show your stuff, they’d hang over your shoulder, correcting every little thing you did. Chances are, this sort of “helicopter” bossing made you miserable, and what’s more, you certainly didn’t perform to the best of your abilities. The truth is, being a great boss – a great leader ‒ isn’t about what you do, it’s about how you feel, or the attitude you have. The best leaders are those who know how to inspire employees, encouraging greatness in the every day and finding ways to unlock hidden potential in everyone. The secret is, great leaders aren’t born, they’re made. Are you ready to become a great leader? These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why there is a big difference between leading and managing; why great leaders should offer rewards and not incentives; and why nothing beats a positive attitude. Ever had a terrible boss? They’re the ones who make getting out of bed each day difficult, who fill your commute to work with dread. Though such bosses hold senior positions in a company, they certainly aren’t leaders. Even the most talented individuals can’t realize a grand vision without support. Leaders of brands, businesses and organizations need employees, of course – but more importantly, they need people just as determined to succeed as they are. Employees will only feel inspired by work if their leader is inspired, too. Imagine your team works around the clock to produce innovative software to improve your product. It’s been a long, hard slog, and morale is waning. What would a good leader do? A good leader would show a positive attitude, no matter what. By reminding employees of their importance as part of a project and even planning a celebratory get-together once the work is done successfully, you can give your team the extra boost they might need. But if you continue to bemoan obstacles and tear your hair out over how long a project is taking, you’ll undermine your competence as a leader. And soon enough, your team will feel and perform poorly, too. There are no benefits to being a demotivating leader. So why do so many pessimistic bosses have the upper hand in organizations? One Gallup poll revealed that bad bosses were the top reason for a person quitting a job. Even the employees who do stay onboard often feel disengaged when bad leaders are involved. Another poll saw 70 percent of US workers express feelings of disconnection in their roles at work. Unfortunately, inspiring leaders are hard to come by in the modern workplace. Today, the labels “manager” and “leader” are used interchangeably. But management and leadership mean two completely different things in the modern workplace. Management and measurement go hand in hand. The job of a manager is to control a team and ensure that work is progressing as it should. For a manager to know when and how she should make a change, she needs to measure her team’s progress. For instance, a manager might feel her team’s productivity is declining. A poor manager might look at when staff arrives to work, or when and for how long they take lunch breaks. These details could reveal the symptoms of a problem, but won’t uncover its real cause. A good manager knows to measure the salaries of employees against competing companies, and the quality of a company’s computers and facilities against the latest models and trends. With this in mind, a manager can pinpoint the places where making a change would benefit employees the most. But if a manager is there to track a team’s progress, what role does a leader play? Simply put, leaders are responsible for inspiring employees to achieve more. It goes without saying that good managers and great leaders are a fantastic combination. So where can we find them? Often, a boss or a manager was formerly just a great employee. But doing a job well and knowing how to motivate others to do a job well are entirely different things. Managing is a skill in itself and requires the right experience, training and attitude. Similarly, great employees don’t become great leaders simply by receiving a fancy new job title. Being appointed a “chief director” or “head” of something doesn’t mean you naturally have the leadership skills to match. Like management, leadership is a skill – perhaps even an art! Leadership is not something you have but a trait you must demonstrate, over and over again. In other words, a leader has to take action. And a great leader never hesitates to take the best course of action without compromise. Naturally, it’s vital that you make employees feel that their suggestions and ideas matter. But you must also remember that the final decision lies with you, the leader. Take new ideas on board by all means, but stick to your guns when you know your plan is the correct one. Say your company is designing a new hair dryer. Based on research, you know customers will respond to a hair dryer with a sleeker design and a more powerful motor. And yet, a team member insists that including an epilator in the design is the best way forward. What should you do? You could hold meeting after meeting in an attempt to come up with a compromise design. But your best option is to stick to the original plan. As a leader, if you’re confident that your idea will work, don’t let detractors get in your way. The product’s success will speak for itself. But what if your team seems to fight your every move? If things are getting out of hand, the problem might not be with them but with you. Failure to commit to past decisions can make it difficult for employees to take you seriously in the future. Let’s imagine you’ve just been named CEO. You’re thrilled, and the first thing you do is gush about your plans to inspire your team. But time passes and after all your promises, you’ve yet to put anything into action. You begin to notice that your employees lack the motivation to do even the most basic of jobs. Think about it: if you don’t follow through on your decisions, why should they? But if you demonstrate unwavering commitment, you’ll see that your team will support you every step of the way. Let’s take a closer look at what it means to make your team feel that their ideas matter to the company. Great leaders constantly listen. Whether helpful suggestions, strange ideas or grumpy complaints, there’s nothing a leader should ignore. A leader can only make good decisions once she has all the information she needs. Sometimes the best ideas come from the most unlikely places. In fact, your staff might come up with many great ideas. Unfortunately, you aren’t always able to give your team credit for it. This is one of the harsh realities of leadership. Sometimes, leaders must portray employee ideas as their own. Sound exploitative? It is. But if you give your staff the respect, care and yes, compensation, that they deserve, they’ll accept this compromise as just the way work is. Be honest with your employees and they’ll respect you, too. A leader worth respecting is also one who knows how to deliver criticism well. In this case, brutal honesty isn’t always the best policy. Blaming employees for mistakes and pressuring people to perform will only demoralize them. This is the last thing you want. So how can you address problems productively? If you ensure your company places a focus on overall improvement and skills development, as a leader you’ll be better equipped to address a situation when a valued employee does the wrong thing. Rather than criticizing, ensure that the employee and the company at large learn from the mistake. The chances are that being treated with respect will inspire your employee to perform better than ever afterward. Leadership plays an important role in your staff’s lives. And identifying leadership potential is crucial when you’re hiring new employees, too! To find the individuals that will give your business the support it needs, you’ll need to keep your eyes peeled for the right attitude in a potential employee. But first, you’ll need to embody the right attitude yourself as you recruit. By thinking of staff as replaceable and around for only a limited time, you’ll end up with employees who are interested only in a paycheck and nothing else. But if you want individuals that will personally invest in the work they do, then you’re looking for employees you’d never dream of replacing. The questions you ask in interviews are key. Experiment with questions that reveal how an applicant would engage in their tasks. Present them with hypothetical problems that require a bit more thinking, and you’ll gain insight into how they approach work. Soon enough, you’ll know how to spot the staff with an attitude to match yours. The right attitude is also central to how you reward employees. Let’s be clear: incentives and rewards are not the same things. While incentives make a promise to encourage better performance, rewards are only given in recognition of great performance. An incentive bonus for finishing work before a deadline is a bribe to motivate employees who should be motivated by your leadership alone. A reward for completing a task faster is something employees should earn, and something you can even surprise them with. With these points in mind, you’re equipped to take your leadership skills to the next level. It’s now time to show that you’ve got the attitude of a great leader. Your staff will notice and appreciate it, too. The key message in this book: Leadership is too often confused with management. Bad leaders are often pessimistic and don’t know how to effectively inspire employees. Firm decision making, great listening skills, open communication and above all, a positive attitude, are what make a leader exceptional. Actionable advice: It’s all right to be selfish! Let’s face it: business is no cakewalk! Leading a team means you have to make tough calls, but this is part of the job. If a decision you’re making falls between an action that will help your business and one that will appease certain employees, know that the business should win, every time. If you’ve explained your decision as best you can and still can’t secure everyone’s support, sometimes you have to put yourself first and forge ahead with your plan. Got feedback?

    "title": "Back to Human",
    "author": "Dan Schawbel",
    "summary": "Technology is changing the world, and not always for the better. Social networking has made it easier for us to connect with people around the globe, but it’s also linked to depression and social isolation. Email and instant messaging have accelerated our ability to communicate, but at the expense of the richer experience that comes with face-to-face contact. Remote working may offer flexibility but it makes it harder to collaborate with colleagues and form workplace friendships. The world is becoming a little less human, and that has a cost. So it’s time for leaders in the business world to think about how they can recognize the benefits of technology while also accepting its limitations. Leaders need to consider how they can get back to a more human approach to business that acknowledges our universal need for interaction and understanding. These blinks provide solutions to some of the most common problems caused, or exacerbated, by technology in the workplace. In these blinks, you’ll learn why technology is as much a distraction as a productivity aid; how important it is to have good friends at work; and why a heartfelt compliment is a better reward than a cash bonus. Digital technology continues to change the world. Things that barely existed a decade ago, like smartphones and tablets, messaging systems and social networks, are a fact of life today. And this technology undoubtedly has had many positive effects. It has never been easier for us to connect and stay in touch with people all over the world. But technology is also having a negative impact on people’s lives. For one, it exacerbates social isolation – a lack of contact and connectedness with other people – particularly amongst younger people who use technology the most. That’s because people crave human connection but nonetheless find it easier and simpler to turn to a device than to have a normal conversation. As a result, people feel they are getting their dose of social interaction. But in reality, they are missing out on forming real relationships. The University of Pittsburgh conducted a study in 2004, finding that a person spending two hours a day on social media doubled their risk of social isolation. Depression is also a concern. University of Houston research from 2015 found that the more active someone was on Facebook, the more likely they were to be depressed. According to the author, that may be because they compare themselves to the curated, shiny and impossible versions of their friends’ lives put on display. Isolation and depression damage social relationships that are hugely important for satisfaction. The famous Grant Study, described in great detail in three books by American psychiatrist George Vaillant, followed the lives of 268 Harvard undergraduates for 75 years from 1938 onward. The study discovered that the strongest predictor of life satisfaction among participants wasn’t their career achievements or earnings, but rather the strength of their relationships. Strong relationships have also been shown to help specifically with satisfaction and success at work. A Wharton Business School study from 2017 that interviewed over 700 employees and managers found that employee loneliness was correlated with poor performance. It’s perhaps not surprising. After all, doing business is all about relationships and relationship building. If our increasing tendency to hide behind screens and devices instead of investing in our relationships is weakening our ability to achieve work and life satisfaction, what’s the solution? Surely, it’s to get back to being more human. Read on and find out how you can help cultivate true, human fulfillment in the workplace. Money can’t buy you happiness. It may be a cliché, but it contains a lot of truth because there is much more to fulfillment and happiness than how much you earn. At the heart of employee fulfillment are human relationships. In 1943, the psychologist Abraham Maslow established his famous hierarchy of needs, which set out what is most psychologically important to humans. The oft-cited theory states that after we fulfill our most basic needs – for food, water, shelter and security – what is most important to humans is a sense of belonging and love. This theory is relevant for the workplace and backed up by evidence. Consider a Gallup poll conducted in 2006, which found that people who say they have a best friend at work are seven times more likely to say they are engaged in their work. They also self-report as being more productive and more innovative than those without a best friend in the workplace. This makes a lot of sense. As Leor Radbil, a senior associate at Bain Capital told the author, having great relationships with his coworkers not only makes work easier, it makes coming to work more enjoyable. Stronger relationships with and between your team members mean happier, more effective employees who stay with you for longer. And it very likely means you’ll feel good about yourself, not just as a boss, but as a human being for fostering them! So how can you help your employees to build fulfilling relationships? Firstly, try to build a culture in which technology doesn’t get in the way of fulfillment. Lead by example, by letting go of instant messaging and email in favor of face-to-face conversations, with all the richness – of body language, emotion, and clarity – that comes with them. Secondly, invest in getting to know people on a personal level. Do you truly understand your colleagues? Do you know their life goals and their deepest fears? If not, you can’t truly help them to achieve fulfillment. So take the time to talk, but most importantly to listen, to your employees about their likes and dislikes and their need to feel fulfilled at work. Technology has, without a doubt, helped make everything quicker. Where once we drafted, signed and sent letters that would take days to arrive, now we write emails in no time. But has technology really made us more productive? That’s hard to really say. That’s partly because while technology is fast, it can also be hugely distracting. Twenty years ago, the typical office worker was perhaps distracted by the morning post, unexpected office visitors, phone calls from clients and conversations with colleagues. Today, she is distracted by an unrelenting stream of messages and alerts. Multiple studies show that office workers receive, on average, over one hundred emails per day, each of which has to be processed mentally, even if we don’t reply to all of them. That’s problematic because it means we struggle to sustain our focus on any one task. Professor Gloria Mark at the University of California, Irvine has been tracking the impact of notifications on office workers since 2004, literally following employees while armed with a stopwatch, and timing their activities. Back in 2004, she found that the typical worker switched her attention every three minutes. By 2012, this attention switch happened pretty much once a minute. By 2014, the typical worker was switching focus even more quickly, concentrating on a single task for less than a minute at a time. The pace of life that comes with technology means that losing focus is easy, which can interfere with how you accomplish important tasks. So what can we do to fight back against this tyranny of distracting notifications? For one, you could try turning off all of your notifications, at least temporarily. If there’s a client crisis in the office or an emergency at home, someone will call you. But without the constant buzz of messages and emails, you’ll find it easier to focus on key tasks and thoughts, checking in to email and messages only when it’s convenient for you. Secondly, focus on prioritization, not multitasking. It’s much easier to be distracted by incoming emails if you don’t have a clear sense of your priorities for the day. So take a few moments at the beginning of the week and the start of every day to write down your priorities. Having your most important tasks committed to paper should help you to keep focus. Productivity is hugely important for any business, but it’s not everything. Equally important is staying fresh and creative, something that can only come from having diverse outlooks. Let’s find out why. Almost every major business today pays lip service to diversity and its importance in the workplace. But the harsh reality is that too many businesses remain homogenous. In Silicon Valley, Hispanics and African Americans combined comprise just 5 percent of the total workforce, according to a 2014 USA Today article. And despite the recent rise in prominence of the Me Too movement, and the growing debate about women’s rights in the workplace, just 24 percent of all senior business roles worldwide are filled by women. Quite apart from the inherent injustice of this situation, homogeneity leads to a deficit of diverse viewpoints and ideas. If all of your employees are all white, male and from a wealthy background, your ability to consider how to serve your customers, who are likely to be a lot more diverse, will be limited. Take Facebook. The social network’s Head of Performance Management, Vivek Raval, told the author that because their customers aren’t uniform, they simply can’t be uniform when it comes to the ideas they have and how they execute them. So how can you effectively embrace and manage diversity? Firstly, when hiring, try hard to avoid the unconscious bias that often leads us to recruit people who look, sound and think just like us. Instead of dwelling on a candidates’ school, or where they come from, focus on their ideas. Try a brainstorming exercise in interviews, asking candidates to generate ideas for a challenge you are currently grappling with. That will give you an opportunity to see if they bring fresh insights that you and your colleagues may have missed. Secondly, to ensure you cultivate a diversity of ideas from your team, strive to build a safe space in which everyone feels able to put forward their views. A great first step is to conduct an anonymous brainstorm. Next time you need to generate ideas, have everyone write down their thoughts anonymously. Then host a meeting to discuss everyone’s thoughts. This isn’t just a great way to elicit lots of ideas. You’ll notice that some people take credit for their ideas, while others stay quiet. That will help you understand who needs some attention, if they are to feel safer and more comfortable putting their ideas forward in the future. A more supportive environment means more fresh perspectives. And what business couldn’t benefit from that? Walk into any coffee shop in any big city in the world on a weekday and you’ll likely encounter at least a handful of remote workers, hunched over glowing MacBooks and tablets, typing away. It has never been easier to work remotely, and many of us love the flexibility that it offers. But, as we’ve already seen, human connection, communication and collaboration is key to personal and business success. If your people only communicate through technology, they are unlikely to form the personal bonds that create strong workplace friendships. And they are unlikely to experience many watercooler moments where moments of insight are generated by conversations that can only happen when you are together in the same space. Perhaps the best evidence for the benefits of people working together is that the very companies that have made it possible for us to work remotely are themselves encouraging working together. Apple’s ultra-modern, purpose-built headquarters in California was designed, according to the Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive, to be a building in which 12,000 employees could walk, talk, connect and collaborate. And physical proximity really is key. In a 1977 study, MIT Professor Thomas J. Allen found that the closer engineers sat to each other, the more likely they were to communicate. If two engineers sat more than 30 meters away from one another they had an almost zero chance of having regular communication. But encouraging collaboration isn’t just about having everyone in the same place. It’s also about creating a culture that values open communication. Here’s a great exercise that can help you do this: Gather your team, and ask everyone to write down one thing that they regard as a success from the last week and one thing that was a struggle. Then go around the room asking each colleague to say a little about what they’ve written down, before offering your congratulations for successes and discussing as a team how each struggle could be better overcome. By doing and repeating this exercise regularly, you’ll build a culture in which your colleagues can discuss both success and failure openly. You’ll make everyone feel more comfortable about collaborating and seeking ideas from one another. If you are like most people, it’s probably not long since you clicked like on something, whether that’s your aunt’s latest Instagram picture or a particularly witty tweet from a friend. Thanks to technology and social networks, giving and receiving recognition and validation is a fact of everyday life. So leaders should pay close attention to how they recognize great work because it will have a significant impact on employee satisfaction and business success. Indeed, a 2011 paper by Maritz, a specialist employee-reward firm, stated that employees who are consistently and meaningfully recognized at work are eleven times more likely to spend their career with a single company. Often businesses take the easy route, relying primarily on pay raises and bonuses to recognize success. But the evidence suggests, this could be counter-productive. A professor from Duke University, Dan Ariely, ran an experiment at an Intel semiconductor factory in 2016, giving different messages to different employees at the start of the week. One group was promised a voucher for free pizza if they hit their targets in a day. Another group was offered a cash bonus, and a third was promised nothing more than a rare compliment from their boss. The results? By the end of the week, the productivity of the group promised a cash bonus declined and the group due to receive the cherished managerial compliment had delivered the best results. It seems we value personal, human recognition much more than a small monetary boost. So how can you improve the way you recognize success and deliver a boost in performance as a result? Try and embrace more personal ways of showing gratitude. Instead of messaging or emailing an employee to thank them, surprise them and colleagues by acknowledging them in front of the whole team. Doing so will not just help that employee feel great, but will show everyone that hard work and achievements are recognized, and encourage everyone to strive for success. To recognize smaller achievements, try writing a note and leaving it on an employee’s desk, instead of writing an impersonal email. Or, instead of a small cash bonus, give a gift voucher for a favorite local restaurant. In an increasingly impersonal world, this personal touch will work wonders. Sometimes, it feels as if our modern work culture regards empathy – the ability and willingness to understand and share other people’s feelings – as a sign of weakness. Too many leaders are self-serving and focused on getting ahead themselves, while boosting business success at the expense of employee well-being. Indeed, according to a 2016 report into empathy in the workplace, published by employee benefits consultancy Businessolver, one third of all employees believe that the only thing their employers care about is profit. Empathy matters because when leaders demonstrate compassion and willingness to not just understand, but to actively help their teammates, through good times and bad, employees will work harder. Research from the Center for Creative Leadership in 2007 has corroborated this, showing that demonstrations of empathy from leaders are positively correlated with job performance. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, is a great example of an empathetic leader. When Tesla experienced problems with worker safety, Musk wrote to his employees. He didn’t just say that safety was his top priority. He offered to meet with every person who had had an injury and promised to get onto the production line himself and perform the same tasks his employees performed every day. You can also demonstrate your empathy as a leader by investing in face-to-face discussions with your employees that explore not just what they are doing at work, but what they are feeling. Since Sam Worobec, Director of Training for Chipotle Mexican Grill, switched from asking his employees questions like “How’s your work project going?” to questions like “How do you feel about your workload?” or “I know you have a lot of family commitments right now, are you handling that okay?,” his team members work much more effectively with him and with one another. They are more ready to talk openly about what is happening in their lives, and he can empathize, commiserate, support and congratulate them more effectively than before. And here’s one final tip for how to make conversations really meaningful. When you talk face-to-face, put your phone away. Research from Virginia Tech has shown that simply leaving a phone on the table while talking reduces the feeling of interconnectedness and empathy between people. Even when we aren’t using it, it seems, technology can get in the way of real, human connections. The key message in these blinks: Too many leaders are reliant on technology, hiding behind it instead of having real conversations with people and ignoring the extent to which it prevents meaningful collaboration. In a world dominated by technology, leaders now have to work hard to help build the human connections and relationships that all of us, deep down, crave. Those who succeed in doing so will reap the rewards of more satisfied, loyal, productive and creative employees. Actionable advice: Ask your team for feedback about their workspace, and act upon it. Improve your team’s experience at work by allowing them to help define it. Ask your employees for feedback about their workspaces, from the arrangement of desks and the number of potted plants to the snacks available in the kitchen. Simply giving your employees a voice about the environment they spend so much time in will go a long way in helping them feel comfortable and happy at work. Got feedback?

    "title": "Becoming an Exceptional Executive Coach",
    "author": "Michael Frisch, Robert Lee, Karen L. Metzger, Jeremy Robinson and Judy Rosemarin",
    "summary": "Even people with high-level corporate jobs sometimes need guidance and support. And in these moments, who better to call on than an executive coach? An individual isn’t just born being a successful coach; it takes a certain set of skills and a lot of professional experience. In these blinks, you’ll discover the essential steps in a coach’s journey to becoming truly exceptional. From learning about a client to putting what you’ve learned into a tangible action plan and reaching an end that pleases everyone, you’ll learn what it takes to excel as an executive coach. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how to question in 360 degrees; how one man used developmental goals to stop micromanaging; and how to deal with the demands of hesitant leaders. Remember what it feels like to start a new job? Stepping out on a new career path can be daunting, and many of us look to coworkers to learn from their examples. But if you’re starting a coaching career, it’s a different game altogether. Why? Because good coaching means engaging executives in a process of self-discovery, and there’s no formula for this. Instead, it’s all about creating your own unique coaching style. Shaping what’s called your personal model of coaching helps you go beyond being a cookie-cutter coach to becoming exceptional. But what does it take to create a personal model of coaching? It all starts with self-reflection. What kind of person are you? What do you bring to the table in organizational contexts? Which coaching concepts and techniques would you prefer as a client? Note your answers down in full sentences, so you can refer to them later. For instance: “I’d like to have a result-oriented process, where I help my client discover solutions to their challenges.” As you begin coaching, document your experiences in terms of your strengths, your weaknesses and your boundaries as you build relationships with clients. Keep track of the techniques you implement – which ones work and which ones don’t. Reflecting on yourself and your work will help you discover what makes you stand out among other coaches. The unique aspects of your coaching style make up your personal model. Though it takes a considerable amount of time, effort and experience before your personal model is fully formed, it’s worth the wait. Once you’ve developed your model, you’ll have a firm foundation from which you can grow and evolve as you gain more experience and become a more confident coach. So how do you start? The first element in your personal model is engagement management. Why is it so important? Find out more in the next blink. To provide exceptional executive coaching, everyone involved has to be invested. So how is this achieved? You need to manage engagement throughout the entire coaching process. This means considering questions such as: How will the contracting be conducted? Who will be involved? What are some possible challenges we’ll face along the way? Whether written or oral, a coaching contract should include the following elements: the steps involved in the coaching process, the time frame, the frequency of coaching meetings and confidentiality agreements. Having a clear contract allows for expectations to be set up front, before coaching begins. This is far better than running into problems and misunderstandings later on. In general, there are three parties to contracting that share overlapping interests: client, sponsors (typically a client’s manager or HR manager) and the coach. All three parties can and should have a hand in shaping the coaching contract. Another success factor in managing engagement is alignment. Alignment occurs when everyone in the process – the coach, the client and sponsors – share the same vision for engagement in the coaching process. As a coach, you are an advocate for greater alignment between your client and sponsors. As an example, Mark, a coach, takes on Cindy, the head of sales, as a client. Mark was called on to coach Cindy as there have been a series of complaints about her behavior. However, Cindy's sponsors aren’t keen to be as involved in the coaching as Mark would like. Mark reminds them that he needs their engagement. Yet he’s got to do this without getting frustrated. Instead, Mark should encourage the active participation of sponsors in the process, even if it may be insufficient at times. This keeps the sponsors engaged, which allows everyone to stay on track throughout the coaching progress. What makes you want to open up to a total stranger? If you’re like most people, your openness and engagement depends on the person you’re with. Coaches should therefore always remember to prioritize their unique relationship with their client above formulaic strategies. Though each coach has her own particular style, there are several general points to guide a fruitful coaching relationship. These points are: trust, based on your client’s safety and confidentiality; honesty, created through your sober, constructive observations; caring, which arises through your empathy; and credibility, which stems from your professionalism. To establish a positive, productive relationship, you need to prepare for each session. Preparation needs to allow for openness and responsiveness, but should also instill a feeling of progress. In other words, you need to be both open and focused. This is not an easy balance to strike! To work toward this, you should identify session goals for your client and for yourself, too.   For instance, your goal could be staying more focused on key issues and not getting sidetracked. As for your client, a goal could be that the session produces at least one possible theme of development. Finally, setting an agenda at the beginning of each session is important for a good relationship. At the start, ask your client how she feels, inquire about her actions and thoughts since the last coaching session and then ask her to tell you what she would like to cover. By sharing the responsibility of setting an agenda, you signal that you have confidence in the client’s ability to overcome her own challenges, and establish how you should work together in the future. This helps you present a credible image which reassures and motivates the client, while building your own coaching confidence all the while! You can’t help someone flourish without having real insight into who they are and what they want. So how can coaches ensure they know their clients better than they know themselves? Good coaches gain insights about clients by collecting data. This helps a coach not only to understand a client but also how the client is perceived and experienced at work. Using several data-gathering methods can be especially helpful if a client has limited self-insight or is really unsure about which improvements or changes to work on. There are two broad categories of data that should be collected: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data comes from standardized instruments that measure a client more specifically. This type of data can be collected through self-assessments completed by the client, for instance. Another way to collect quantitative data is to use 360-degree questionnaires, which gather feedback from a client’s immediate colleagues such as managers, peers and direct reports. These questionnaires are excellent for gleaning the perceptions of a client on a wide range of skills and leadership dimensions. Unlike quantitative data, qualitative data comes from personal observations that others have made about the client, as well your own impressions. In executive coaching, the most frequently used qualitative-data gathering method is interviewing a client’s colleagues. To gain the data you need, you can ask the interviewee to describe the contexts in which he and your client interact, and his observations about what your client does well and where she could improve. The goal of this informational interview is similar to other assessment methods, in that you are able to gain a broader, deeper understanding of a client. So it’s crucial that you design questions by carefully considering which information will be most useful to you and your client. After gaining some insight about your client, you should have an idea of where change has to happen, and why. Your next step is development planning. This is where the need for change is translated into tangible and actionable goals. These goals change shape as a coaching relationship matures. To begin, goals emerge from felt needs, the initial wishes articulated by sponsors or clients. These then develop as negotiated goals, explored through a client’s history, feedback and self-perception, to ultimately become designed objectives, shaped from assessment results and other analyzed and distilled data. Ankit, a coach, was hired before a company promoted a manager named Howard, because he was unfortunately prone to micromanaging employees. This was the felt need of the organization. Ankit and Howard negotiated that Howard should empower his employees to take more responsibility to overcome his micromanaging. This was the negotiated goal. Finally, designed objectives are the goals that the client will follow through with even after the coach is gone, in this case: build stronger relationships to support greater empowerment. Once the designed objectives are clear to you and your client, it is time to create a written development plan. Typical sections in a development plan include a brief statement about process, client strengths, and each designed objective followed by action ideas for progress toward the objective. Development plans are created with the expectation that they will be shared with sponsors, so they need to be clear also to those who have not been part of the process. Strong development plans become an invaluable resource as the coaching process continues. Once we achieve success, most of us prefer to give others advice rather than receive it. Coaches often find themselves facing considerable challenges when tasked with coaching successful clients. Coaching senior leaders is a challenge that requires both significant skill and flexibility. Patience and motivational interviewing make change less threatening for senior leaders, who are often resistant to letting go of a current set of behaviors. It takes more time for such clients to accept change, meaning you have to remain patient, as your credibility may be tested more than it is at lower organizational levels. Remember that your patience in responding to a senior client’s reluctance also conveys positivity and hope. A good way to deal with hesitation is motivational interviewing. This method relies on broad, open questions to explore with the client both current and changed conditions. A few questions might include asking your client what change means to her, and what the pros or cons of change would be in her particular situation. Also, you might want to explore what she thinks she would need to give up to make a change. These types of questions can make change seem less threatening. Also, senior leaders are likely to treat all outside professionals as consultants, so expect to be lumped in this category as well. Senior leaders may demand counsel from you because they may believe that a coach is supposed to help them in all aspects of their job. While coaching and consulting can be synergistic, the activities are quite different. In general terms, coaches ask in order to explore, while consultants ask in order to tell. In this situation, coaches need to focus on facilitating discovery. If your client is facing a challenge and asking for counsel, try to point out the development potential in the challenge. This will support the client’s growth without reducing her responsibility for progress. Everything comes to an end, even successful coaching relationships. It’s highly recommended that you and your client openly discuss the end of the process, and what it means for the future. A considerate closure depends on what you do to anticipate and plan for the end of coaching. While the closure date can change through mutual consent, it is important to avoid letting the final session be a surprise either to the client or to you. Targeting a final session makes the ending tangible and prompts discussion of both plans and feelings about those plans. You can use final sessions to ask your client to reflect on a number of issues, such as what she primarily learned through the process, what worked and what could have been better, or how she will focus on development in the future. Ending coaching is also an opportunity for you to reflect on your own experience, identify gaps in your abilities and consider future engagements. After a session has ended, clients and sponsors can be surveyed more formally about their satisfaction and the results of the process on the client’s behavior. Evaluation is usually framed in terms of answering the question, How effective was coaching in achieving the results envisioned? In evaluating the impact of intervention, psychologist Donald Kirkpatrick has identified four variables. These are: reactions, which measure client’s and sponsors’ satisfaction; learning, which measures what the client learned from the process; behavioral changes, which measure the change seen by others; and organizational results, which measure tangible benefits to an organization, such as increased revenue or more customers. Try to always create an end process that instills positive closure, confidence in the future and a support structure that encourages continuing development. In other words, give your coaching efforts the positive ending that you and your client deserve! The key message in this book: Every person is unique, and so is every coaching process. By considering the vital elements of coaching, from outlining goals, managing engagement and encouraging development, you can develop an individual style of coaching that will have a positive and enduring impact on your clients. Actionable advice:Be present. Make sure to be physically present when your client makes a presentation, or find a way to discreetly join in on meetings. This gives you a real opportunity to observe your client while interacting with colleagues, and you’ll gather concrete examples that your client will be able to relate to more easily.

    "title": "Better and Faster",
    "author": "Jeremy Gutsche",
    "summary": "A few thousand years ago, humanity made a bold decision. People stopped being hunters and started being farmers. Most decided that a life of relative comfort and predictability was better than one of risk and constant movement. You might think they made a wise move, but in fact this change led to humanity’s becoming lazier and more complacent, something that affects us to this day. How? Well take a look at any business industry, and you’ll find leaders who embody farmer mentality: people too indifferent, scared or set in their ways to change. More often than not, these people fail. There are others, however, who’ve clung to the life of the hunter; they’re quick to act, ready to be brutal and never scared to take risks. These are the people you ought to emulate. These blinks tell you all you need to know about becoming a hunter, allowing you to succeed in today’s constantly changing world. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Red Bull is a success in spite of its taste; how Volvo uses a car’s ugliness to sell it; and how Blockbuster went from the top to bankrupt in no time. Every business leader thinks they have what it takes to succeed. They’re smart enough to know what needs to be done and tenacious enough to overcome any obstacle that stands in their way. Nonetheless, failure in business is as common as dirt. And that’s because the people at the top – especially those in fast-changing industries – frequently fall into one of the three so-called farmer traps. Farmer trap #1 refers to complacency, which develops when people rest on the laurels earned from past successes. As an example, look at typewriter manufacturer Smith Corona, a former industry giant who became complacent and failed to adapt to the changing marketplace. In 1990, the company pulled out of a joint venture with computer giant Acer, because they believed their business was too strong to be vulnerable to market change. Three years later, Smith Corona declared bankruptcy; they’d been crushed by the emerging computer sector. Similarly, farmer trap #2 occurs when you repeat actions that brought success in the past and expect the same outcome in the present. Blockbuster Video is the perfect example of a business that crumbled because it fell into the Farmer Trap of repetition: in 2009, the franchise boasted 9,000 locations and 60,000 employees. But just a year later, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy: the company had failed to adapt to the streaming market, continuing to direct almost all their resources into franchising and physical media. Finally, farmer trap #3 describes a state of protectiveness. This occurs when companies set up barriers that protect the status quo and inhibit evolution. For instance, film manufacturer Kodak missed some wonderful opportunities because they were overly protective of their elite status in the analog film market. But that was a big mistake: the company’s unwillingness to invest resources into digital innovation led them to declare bankruptcy in 2012. As we’ve learned, it’s easy to fall into one of the farmer traps. But luckily, it’s also possible to avoid them by cultivating the three hunter instincts. First, don’t be complacent; instead, be insatiable. Because insatiability – constantly scanning the horizon for the next opportunity – is the core of hunter instinct #1. Capital One Bank is a great example of a company driven by this instinct. After the 2008 financial crisis, the bank poured their resources into innovation and experimentation. As a result, they soon boasted a billion-dollar portfolio of low-risk assets. In other words, by focusing on innovation, the bank successfully adapted to the marketplace; meanwhile, most of its competitors suffered a credit crunch. Moving on: hunter instinct #2 rejects repetitiveness in favor of curiosity – the drive to seek out new and fresh sources of inspiration. How else will you spot new trends and develop your next business success? After all, innovation happens when people take creative mental leaps, connecting fields in ways others couldn’t have imagined. And to make those kinds of connections, you have to be curious. Take entrepreneur Ron Finley as a prime example of this principle. For Finley, his Los Angeles neighborhood was a source of inspiration, leading him to success in a variety of fields, from fashion to urban gardening to social outreach. Finally, hunter instinct #3 reminds us that we need to have a willingness to destroy. Instead of being overprotective and cautious, you have to be ready to abandon your safety net if you want to encounter new ideas and opportunities. In fact, the willingness to destroy is precisely what explains chef Eric Ripert’s decades-long success. He’s been able to sustain the coveted three-star Michelin rating for years and years, despite the fact that he constantly throws out old menus and starts again from scratch, fully embracing the new. So now that we know how to awaken our hunter instincts, it’s time to learn how to put them into practice. And that’s what the next blinks are all about. It’s time to put your hunter instincts into practice: there are six scenarios, or patterns of opportunity, that will allow you to spot new business models and products, giving you a serious competitive edge. Let’s start with two of these patterns: convergence and divergence. The former, convergence, is about taking advantage of market chaos to create opportunity by mixing and integrating the right trends. After all, you can create a winning idea by combining multiple services and products. For instance, the successful iPhone fitness and running app, “Zombies, Run!,” employs convergence by combining three things: GPS technology, the lucrative fitness market and the highly popular zombie trend. As you can see, combining several appealing patterns and industries is a great way of providing value to customers. The second pattern, divergence, takes a different approach by carving out a competitive advantage through a unique perspective that diverges from the overcrowded mainstream. Designing a product that taps into compelling alternative notions like rebellion, status or luxury will allow you to stand out from the crowd. The key to successfully pulling off the divergence approach is marketing; in order to stand out from the competition, you have to turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength. And that’s exactly what Red Bull did, becoming one of the most successful beverage brands, despite their less-than-palatable product. The company succeeded by using a savvy advertising strategy that communicated an exciting and unique brand. Ultimately, the company proved that with the right marketing plan, you can harness the power of divergence and create successful products and services that stand out. Let’s move on to the next two patterns of opportunity: Cyclicality and Redirection. These two approaches are all about harnessing the power of momentum, by doing things like, for instance, forecasting trends and figuring out how to take advantage of predictably recurring elements such as retro appeal, nostalgia, economic cycles and generational patterns. This point speaks directly to cyclicality, which requires you to foster a sense of history that’ll allow you to look beyond the moment and anticipate what’s next. This can be a powerful way of carving out opportunity: consider the fact that all sorts of companies – liquor companies and auto manufacturers, fashion brands and food products – have managed to reinvigorate their businesses by tapping into cyclical patterns and taking advantage of nostalgia. Just look at the success of Instagram, a product that combines nostalgia with the social media photo-sharing trend. These two simple elements are at the heart of the world-famous app, which imbues user-generated photographs with a vintage-like quality. The next pattern, redirection, aims to channel the power of a trend or behavior by refocusing, reprioritizing or reversing it. This is essentially the art of “spin” – turning a potentially negative narrative upside down, using the momentum of a trend to your own advantage and inspiring desire for your product in the process. Through well-crafted redirection, you can create an appealing positive narrative out of something more negative. Just look at Volvo: by using the slogan, “They’re boxy but they’re good,” the auto company launched a successful marketing campaign that drew attention to the car’s safety features. By playing up the security aspect, Volvo neutralized the car’s unpopular design and ultimately increased sales. Let’s learn about the two remaining patterns of opportunity: reduction and acceleration. These are both proven methods for finding a specific market, creating a winning business idea and becoming a better innovator, decision-maker and investor. Reduction involves targeting niche audiences with a product or service that stands out because of its extreme simplicity. Doing this gets to the core of a business concept by using crowdsourcing and localization to remove any unneeded parts. In other words, by identifying and then skillfully removing all the complex layers of existing products, you can create value and carve out success in a small market. And that will open up many more possibilities. As it happens, reduction explains the wild popularity of GoPro, an easy-to-use, wide-angle, two-button camera that has proven irresistible to a specific group of consumers eager to capture their adventurous exploits.   The next pattern of opportunity, acceleration, relies on the practice of perfecting, exaggerating, reimagining or repositioning key product features as a way of differentiating yourself from the competition. To do that, you have to identify a crucial feature of an existing product or business concept which you then dramatically enhance. In other words, figure out what’s great about an idea and then accelerate it; making it bigger, faster or better will engage customers. To that end, just look at Dyson: the brand established itself as the world standard for high-end vacuum cleaners after they refined the device to create the most powerful vacuum on the market. It took 5,127 prototypes to get there, but it was worth it: in 1991, James Dyson won the International Design Fair prize for his ultra-powerful and efficient product. Wake up your “inner hunter.” Familiarize yourself with the six patterns of opportunity. Done all that? Great! Now you can start narrowing your focus and zero in on a great business idea. Of course, finding the nugget of a successful idea is easier said than done. The key is to establish a “hunting ground” and identify a cluster of opportunity – some group of products, services or concepts that have a similar approach. Then, you use the six patterns of opportunity to reframe the central idea and make it special. But don’t limit your hunting ground by only researching and collecting ideas that are obviously similar. Instead, look beyond your immediate market to find clever approaches to similar goals. That’s the way to create something truly unique. For instance, instead of developing a simple pop-up store concept, use convergence to launch a “Double Business.” One artist, Karl Lagerfeld, did just that when he combined a pop-up fashion shop with an art gallery. However, no matter what industry you choose to work within, you have to be able to forecast future trends before they actually happen. Luckily, whether you’re hunting ground involves movies, fashion, tech, retail, broadcast media or food, you can use the six patterns to find future opportunities. In the fashion field, for example, retailers like Zara and H&M have reached success by providing consumers with more choice. In fact, Zara became one of the fastest-growing retailers by both speeding up their production process – they only need 14 days to get a newly-designed product into stores – and by offering thousands of different items at any given moment. But what’s next? By applying convergence to the fashion industry, we can predict the rise of trends like wearable technology, 3D printed clothing and more. And the firms that figure out how to capitalize on those trends now will be dominant in the future. The key message: Today’s marketplace is far more unpredictable and chaotic than ever before. To be successful in this turbulent environment, you must embrace change. Do so by awakening your inner hunter and exploiting patterns of opportunity. That way, you’ll be able to adapt quickly – to not only survive, but to thrive. Actionable advice: Cyclicality is one of the most persistent and prevalent patterns of opportunity. Whatever your field, you can take advantage of this pattern by following four simple takeaways.

    "title": "Beyond Measure",
    "author": "Margaret Heffernan",
    "summary": "In the age of big data, many companies are obsessed with metrics. If there aren’t any numbers, if something can’t be measured, then how can one know what action to take? Well, some things are beyond measure. Take relationships, for example. Could you quantify the relationship you have with your family or loved ones, with your friends? Probably not, and, as you probably know, businesses are full of relationships that can produce magnificent outcomes if they work well. So, let’s take a look at how these interpersonal relationships work and what companies can do to achieve greatness through small changes. In these blinks, you’ll find out what social capital is and how it helps businesses succeed; why working more hours leads to less productivity; and about the amazing results of bringing in an outsider. You’ve probably been there before. You’re sitting in a business meeting, and someone proposes a business decision you disagree with. And because you don’t want to seem hostile, you hold your tongue. But avoiding debate is never helpful, and there are ways your company can change this unproductive habit. The key is creative conflict, a skill that, like all others, can be learned through practice. With creative conflict comes a willingness to disagree and challenge the general consensus so that new and creative ideas can be developed. But what many people don’t know is that there’s a talent to productive disagreement. Brooke Deterline is a constructive conflict specialist, and she is always astounded by how her clients assume they’ll be able to productively manage group discussions on their first attempt. It’s particularly surprising since people recognize that other skills, such as learning a language, a musical instrument or public speaking, take time and practice. And when it comes to creative conflict and the ability to effectively express your opinion and meet conflict head-on, it is still practice that makes perfect. The first key point people need to realize is that they must prepare and gain supportive allies before they take on authority figures at the workplace. Deterline coached one of her clients, Luke, through this process when he had to stand up to his aggressive boss while negotiating a contract. The first step was simulating how the situation might play out; they considered how his boss would react to different statements and devised appropriate counter-reactions for Luke. Then, Luke reached out to his colleagues within the company for advice and support. This allowed him to strengthen his position further so that he could engage with his boss in a productive conversation. So, by the time Luke had the actual negotiation with his boss, he was confident. He knew what he needed to say and how to react appropriately to whatever his temperamental boss threw his way. Have you ever been part of a group project where everyone involved was unfamiliar with one another? If you have, then you probably noticed that discussions were mostly unproductive, because everyone was hesitant and nervous around each other. To combat this kind of situation, and enable constructive conflict, it’s important to establish social capital within your company. The concept of social capital isn’t new. Anthropologists who studied early communities coined the term to explain why certain tribes thrived and succeeded – it’s what people in a community feel when they can rely and depend upon one another for help, and it remains a great survival tool for companies today. And you will find that when you combine creative conflict with social capital, your company will enter into a cycle of prosperity. This happens when people engage in creative conflict. The experience allows coworkers to bond with one another and improves their relationships. Naturally, this creates even more social capital within the company, which in turn builds more trust so that people feel more confident to engage in future creative conflict. But creative conflict isn’t the only way to build social capital. One company used a different kind of creativity to help improve collaborative efforts between departments. The CEO launched a company-wide project in which each department was charged with making a short film that highlighted the work of a different department. They weren’t expected to make an Oscar-winning movie, nor did they have to: people only need to take small actions in order to build social capital. And the project worked perfectly. The whole company gathered in a movie theater to watch the results, and the movies not only turned out to be creative and original but also got the previously uncooperative company members talking and bonding with one another. Working longer hours should mean that more work gets done, right? Actually, that might not be the case. Over 100 years ago, scientist Ernst Abbe discovered that reducing the workday from 9 to 8 hours increased overall productivity. Even now, studies continue to show that overworked employees are less productive, but companies remain reluctant to change their ways. Since Abbe’s discovery, many studies have shown that people working over 40 hours a week are less productive and more prone to making mistakes, all of which results in a less efficient company. Yet these companies remain largely blind to these facts. Apart from industries like aviation or truck driving, where long hours can lead to deadly accidents, many continue to believe that workaholics make the best employees. This holds true even in the face of compelling evidence. For example, while 50 percent of all mergers or acquisition deals fail, few people question whether or not this could be due to exhausted CEOs making poor decisions that could be avoided by working more reasonable hours. Working too much can lead to what’s known as tunnel vision. When people are tired, their ability to think and reason diminishes, and they often become stubborn in their decision-making, refusing to adapt to changing circumstances or even recognize existing errors. Naturally, under these conditions, employees become increasingly inefficient in their work, which unfortunately results in having to work even longer hours! What’s worse is that being overworked can lead to health problems as well. In 2012, the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health showed that working 11 hours a day doubles a person’s risk of depression. Furthermore, employees who work more than 55 hours a week start to show signs of losing their language and problem-solving skills by middle age. All this in addition to the slower reaction times that overworked people tend to have. You might think that the analytical mind of a scientist and the abstract mind of an artist would make for an unproductive pairing. But such a team can actually make some astounding breakthroughs. This is exactly what happened at Roche Pharmaceuticals. Team leader Matthias Essenpreis was at a loss when his group was trying to improve the company’s diabetes products. He knew his team needed an exciting new perspective, so Essenpreis came up with an unorthodox idea: to invite an artist to work with the team. It was an effective strategy. While his team of scientists approached problem-solving in a logical way, the artist, Kelly Heaton, took a more holistic approach. Rather than focusing on the technical aspects, the artist took on the perspective of the diabetes patient. She was also a great communicator and her fresh perspective allowed her to ask the right questions when the team was stuck. As a result, in 2003, Roche developed diabetes packs containing an innovative new device that allowed patients to simultaneously administer insulin and measure their blood sugar. Thinking outside the box can also lead organizations to breaking boundaries and connecting with other businesses. Traditionally, companies tend to look inward; they create protective policies and focus on safe products to maintain a comfortable status quo. These days, however, they are discovering that true innovation comes when companies consider themselves as interactive parts of a bigger corporate picture. We can see this change of perspective in ARM, a company that specializes in semiconductor and software design. When ARM started, it was a tiny company of only 12 employees. In order to grow and increase production, ARM learned to collaborate with much larger firms that had thousands of employees. Rather than struggling on their own, they grew by becoming a part of other companies’ teams. Even today, many of ARM’s employees spend most of their time working within other organizations. Companies that don’t collaborate are often less creative than companies that do. Indeed, collaboration is, in some ways, the name of the game. And that’s why companies hoping to innovate should adopt a flat hierarchy. A flat hierarchy is a company structure that eliminates the levels of middle management that separate employees from executives. Paul Harris, CEO of South Africa’s FirstRand Bank is a proponent of flat hierarchies. For Harris, part of this structure’s appeal is a matter of efficiency. Vertical hierarchies, with their long chain of managers, are needlessly complicated: the flow of information from top to bottom can often get stuck in middle management, leaving people lower on the ladder clueless as to what their bosses want them to do. But more importantly, flat hierarchies give every member of a company the opportunity to contribute creative ideas, which makes for a much more innovative environment. When FirstRand Bank introduced a flat hierarchy system, the idea of introducing an electronic payment method and giving clients the ability to use their cell phones to transfer money, easily made its way from idea to implementation and is now a service for every FirstRand Bank customer. The thing is that, when one person has too much power, it’s often a recipe for disaster. Research in this area shows that when people become powerful they also become worse at listening to others, failing to take into account the opinions of their employees. They get so preoccupied with pursuing their own agenda that the ideas, emotions and perspectives of other people simply fall by the wayside. Many of the traits can be traced back to the fact that these powerful leaders tend to feel that all the responsibility rests on their shoulders. Therefore, they are reluctant to seek help or assistance, fearing it will be perceived as weakness. Implementing a flat hierarchy is one way to avoid ending up with a bad leader. The key message in this book: Having a successful company isn’t just about generating billions of dollars in profit; it’s about fostering creativity, innovation and open communication. And you can achieve this with some small but important changes – like cutting down on work hours, flattening hierarchies and encouraging people to voice their opinions. Simple changes like these can make all the difference. Actionable advice: Lead from where you are. It doesn’t matter whether you are the CEO of a company or a regular employee. Look out for opportunities to lead your team to success. For example, practice voicing your opinion as often as possible. This may result in some annoyance at first, and you may make mistakes, but your team will thank you in the long run for getting the ball rolling and showing that you care about the company.

    "summary": "So-called visionary companies have a lot to teach us. They are companies with long track-records for success and widely admired as the crown jewels of their industries. What’s more, their success is enduring – they prosper even as great leaders retire and individual hit-products become obsolete. To properly study and learn from these companies, the authors first had to identify them by surveying hundreds of prominent CEOs for the names of companies they considered visionary. The 18 most commonly mentioned firms – including such venerable names as the Walt Disney Company, Marriott Hotels, and Merck – were included in the study. The visionary companies were then paired up with comparison companies: firms that shared similar products and markets but which, while not being outright poor performers, were called “visionary” far less often in the CEO survey. Both groups of companies were then examined across their considerable life spans (the average founding date lay in the 1890s for both groups). Based on massive amounts of data from interviews, annual reports, financial statements, news articles and many other sources, all aspects of these corporations were studied, ranging from their ownership structures to their cultures. To understand the extraordinary success of the visionary companies, consider this fact: if you had invested a dollar in their shares in 1926, that dollar would have been worth $6,356 by 1990. Compare that to $955 if you had invested in the comparison companies, and only $415 if you had invested in the general market, and you’ll see just how impressive the visionary companies’ performance is. No wonder that all manner of Fortune 500 companies have been fascinated by the findings of this study. Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. Contrary to what most people believe, the success of a visionary company is not dependent on great ideas. The founder of Sony, for example, had no specific idea of what products his company would make. He actually held a brainstorming session after founding the company to evaluate business ideas ranging from sweetened bean-paste to miniature-golf equipment. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard also had no specific idea in mind when they founded Hewlett-Packard (HP). They experimented with almost farcically diverse ideas, such as automatic urinal flushers and bowling foul-line indicators. Hence, it seems that great ideas are not necessary for the start of a visionary company. Nor are high-profile, charismatic leaders. While visionary companies did have superb individuals at the top of their organization, they were often down-to-earth, reserved and modest people. But then, what is the secret of enduring success? Many comparison companies had great ideas and strong leadership, yet they all fell behind the visionary companies eventually. Why? Instead of focusing on a single product or a single leader, the visionary companies studied built themselves into outstanding organizations that constantly churned out great ideas and great leaders. The real creation of the founders was not a product at all but the company itself; constantly advancing independently of any one person or idea. Think of a clock on the wall. Having one great idea or visionary leader is like getting a glimpse of that clock and being able to tell the time in that instant. But building an organization that constantly generates great ideas and leaders is like building your own clock: a reliable machine. Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies have a higher purpose for their existence than to merely chase profits. Together with the companies’ core values – enduring tenets that guide their every decision – this purpose forms their core ideologies: a set of stable principles that guides the company through generations, much like the “truths” of the American Declaration of Independence. Consider for example the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J&J). In 1935, the CEO, Robert W. Johnson Jr., wrote out the company’s core ideology in a document called “Our Credo,” which listed the company’s responsibilities: first to their customers, second to their employees and so forth. Finally, fifth and last on the list, after all the other responsibilities had been fulfilled, Johnson said that shareholders should receive “a fair return.” Likewise, most visionary companies studied were not primarily after profit. Nevertheless, while some ideologies may seem soft or idealistic, visionary companies managed to find a way to stay pragmatic in their business decisions and make profits without ever wavering from their core ideologies. A core ideology is important not only when visionary companies prosper but also when they hit upon trouble. For example, when Ford faced a dire crisis in the 1980s, instead of just fighting fires, its management team stopped to discuss and clarify what the company stood for and how they could espouse the values of the founder, Henry Ford. Ford’s comparison company, General Motors, made no such effort. Though every visionary company studied had a core ideology, their content varied greatly. What counts is not the content of the ideology but rather that an authentic ideology exists and is rigorously acted upon.  Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. The real heart of what makes visionary companies so successful is that while they jealously guard the permanence of their core ideologies, the manifestations of that core ideology are always open for change and progress. For example, Wal-Mart’s drive to “exceed customer expectations” is a stable element of its core ideology, but the customer-greeters at the entrance to their stores are a practice that can change. Similarly, Boeing’s core ideology is to be a pioneer in the field of aviation, but building jumbo jets is a manifestation of that ideology that can change. This flexibility demonstrates how visionary companies refuse to abide by the so-called tyranny of the OR, whereby a company must choose between staying true to its core ideology or stimulating progress. Instead, visionary companies use the genius of the AND – experimenting and developing – while still adhering to their core ideologies. Visionary companies have their core ideologies to guide them, but they are also relentless in their efforts to continually improve their products, business and organization. They never settle and never become complacent. Consider the founder of the Marriott Corporation, J. Willard Marriot, who lived by the motto “Keep on being constructive, doing constructive things, until it’s time to die… make every day count, to the very end.” This sounds rather depressing, but is also a great commitment to constant progress. Just like their core ideologies, this drive for progress is innate and unquestioned in visionary companies. Progress is stimulated both by setting bold goals and by creating concrete mechanisms that encourage people to innovate and improve. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. To drive progress, visionary companies often set themselves extremely bold objectives – so-called big hairy audacious goals (BHAGs) – to which they commit utterly and completely. BHAGs are so ambitious that they often seem unrealistic, especially to outsiders. Nevertheless, they’re also clear and tangible enough to energize and focus the organization. A well-known example of a non-corporate BHAG is the one set by John F. Kennedy in 1961 when he proclaimed that the U.S. would take a man to the moon and back safely by the end of the decade. At the time, this was an almost ludicrously bold commitment, but it did get the U.S. moving vigorously forward. Boeing set many BHAGs during its history, including its commitment to developing the 747 jet. Boeing pursued this goal single-mindedly, without ever even considering the possibility of failure. The CEO stated that they would complete the jet even if it consumed the entire company, which it nearly did: at one stage roughly 86,000 people – some 60% of their workforce – were laid off as sales of the plane did not meet expectations. Similarly, Thomas J. Watson Sr., the founder of the Computer Tabulating Recording Company, set a BHAG by renaming his company – which sold coffee grinders and butcher scales – to reflect his ambition for global status. The new name was audacious at the time: International Business Machines (IBM). BHAGs often take on lives of their own. Just as the space program continued after Kennedy’s death, the visionary companies studied pursued their BHAGs even as new CEOs and directors came and went. Once a BHAG was achieved, new ones were set – always in line with the company’s core ideology. Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations pursue their core ideologies so single-mindedly that their corporate cultures are almost cult-like. For example, new employees quickly find themselves socializing primarily with their colleagues, and they are encouraged to be secretive about the inner workings of their companies. Employees often become completely immersed in the core ideology. Consider IBM, for example, where future managers in training would rise and sing songs from an IBM songbook: “March on with I.B.M., Work hand in hand…” Similarly, the Walt Disney Company expected its employees to live and breathe its core ideology of wholesome family fun. For example, men with facial hair were not accepted as employees at theme parks, and anyone heard uttering a four-letter word in the presence of Walt Disney himself was fired immediately – no exceptions. There is not much room in visionary companies for people who do not meet their tough expectations and standards. New employees often find that either they fit right in and thrive, or they perform poorly, are unhappy and exit the company quickly. In this regard, there are no compromises at visionary companies. Conversely, because the employees are confident and can be counted on to adhere to the company’s core ideology, they can also be given the leeway to experiment. This stimulates progress and enables the company to avoid the dangerous group-think endemic in many cults. Note though that visionary companies are not personality cults, centered around a charismatic CEO or founder but rather around the core ideology of the company. Though charismatic personalities can also drive passionate work, such “cults” invariably collapse when the person leaves. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave. While the visionary companies studied often had outstanding CEOs at their helm at one time or another, what was even more impressive was their ability to continually produce such high-quality leaders. The organizations focused hard on cultivating managerial talent within the company so that new leaders could be counted on to continue in line with the company’s core ideology. At the same time, visionary companies engaged in timely succession-planning to ensure continuity in leadership even if something unexpected were to happen. Consider for example the General Electric Company (GE), whose most famous CEO is without a doubt, the legendary Jack Welch. But actually thanks to the company’s fervent emphasis on internal management training and CEO succession, GE has enjoyed a century of Welch-caliber CEOs. In fact, more GE alumni have gone on to become executives of American corporations than the alumni of any other company. And Welch himself outlined his plan for succession seven years before retiring, though even this seems last-minute compared to Bob Galvin, the former CEO of Motorola, who began planning for the next generation a quarter-century before finally leaving. In contrast, the comparison companies often hired external CEOs who were unfamiliar with the company and who sometimes began steering it in new, wholly ill-conceived directions. Also, the CEOs at comparison companies were often near-tyrannical and engaged in very little succession planning, which left gaping holes in the companies’ leadership when they left. Some comparison companies even had CEOs who actively hindered succession planning and sabotaged would-be candidates. These companies then stumbled when the troublesome CEO finally left. Visionary companies produce a continual stream of high-caliber leaders. Charles Darwin discovered that evolution is a series of successful “experiments” in which slight variations are introduced to a species and the strongest new variants survive. Similarly, the visionary companies studied understood the need to stimulate a similar evolutionary progress within their businesses. They encouraged their employees and management to experiment with new ideas, products and practices, some of which became great successes. Consider for example J&J’s famous Band-Aids. They were born when an employee put together some surgical tape and gauze to quickly bandage his wife’s fingers after she accidentally cut herself with a kitchen knife. When he mentioned the idea to the J&J marketing department, they embraced it and eventually, Band-Aid products became the company’s best-selling category. Or consider 3M, which directed its employees to use 15 percent of their working time to work on any pet projects they felt like. Two such projects by two separate employees eventually collided to produce the famous Post-It Notes. This would never have happened if 3M hadn’t actively encouraged experimentation and allowed its employees to continue with their pet projects, even when early market studies were negative. Contrast this with 3M’s comparison company, Norton, which actually discouraged the pursuit of opportunities outside of its traditional product lines. One aspect of evolution is that some – or even most – variations fail; the same is true in business. J&J experienced some very prominent failures too, for example, its colored casts for children with bone fractures. The casts quickly turned hospital bed sheets into something resembling modern art and threw hospital laundries into chaos. Visionary companies understood that failed experiments are the necessary price to pay for evolution and must not be punished lest further experimentation be discouraged. Visionary companies stimulate evolutionary progress by encouraging experimentation. While many companies claim to adhere to idealistic values, encourage experimentation or embrace constant progress, very little is seen in practice. The visionary companies studied, on the other hand, managed to translate their values into reality by creating concrete mechanisms that affected the daily lives and decisions of employees. 3M did not merely say, “We want our employees to be more innovative.” Instead, it implemented several mechanisms to encourage this idea, one example was allowing employees to use 15 percent of their time on pet projects and dictating that 30 percent of each division’s annual sales must come from products less than four years old. Likewise, visionary companies did not merely talk about constant improvement; rather, they created mechanisms to ensure it. Wal-Mart, for example, spurred constant growth with so-called “Beat Yesterday” ledgers, which were used to compare each day’s sales to those of the year prior. Similarly, Hewlett-Packard instituted a grueling process of ranking its employees annually to stop those who gained a high status from just coasting. The visionary companies also took concrete actions in the long run. They invested far more than comparison companies in creating new technologies and business practices, training and developing their human capital, as well as in supporting research and development. For example, when Merck wanted to become a force in medical research, it deliberately modeled its labs on academic ones and allowed its researchers to publish their findings in academic journals – very unusual for private companies at the time. It also decided the product-development process should be driven by research rather than marketing as it was in many other companies. This attracted top scientists to Merck’s labs. Visionary companies don’t just talk – they take concrete actions to implement their values. The key message in this book: Visionary companies are able to attain their phenomenal success by staying true to their core ideologies while still relentlessly pursuing progress. A company’s core ideology comprises its core values but also its purpose, meaning the reason it exists beyond profits or shareholder value. To supplement their core ideology, visionary companies also stimulate constant progress by setting bold goals and by instituting grassroots mechanisms to realize their policies. The questions this book answered: Why should we study visionary companies? Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. What are the main principles that visionary companies use to thrive? Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. What are the specific policies and mechanisms that visionary companies use to preserve their core ideology and yet stimulate progress? Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave. Visionary companies produce a continual stream of high-caliber leaders. Visionary companies stimulate evolutionary progress by encouraging experimentation. Visionary companies don’t just talk – they take concrete actions to implement their values.",

    "summary": "If you’re an entrepreneur with a small service business, you might dream of selling your company some day. So what can you do to structure your business to prepare it for a successful acquisition that gets you the best possible price? These blinks answer these questions through the story of Alex Stapleton, who wants to sell his marketing agency. Alex built up a small company with only a few employees, but wants to have more time with his family and is quite stressed by his work. Ted Gordon, an old friend and entrepreneur who has sold businesses successfully in the past, guides him through the process. In addition, you’ll learn why you should always have more than one salesperson; what it takes to get your management team to stay with your company for a long time; and how to find a broker that’ll get you the best possible deal on your company. Let’s say you’re an entrepreneur who’s just launched a service business, like a design agency. How can you make it successful? Should you concentrate on one service or take any business you can get – even offers requiring services that aren’t your speciality? Some people would accept every offer. But that’s not the right strategy for long-term success. Here’s why: A focus on one service allows clients to see the company’s core strengths. As a result, people will come to you with specific problems that you can solve better than anyone else. When clients can’t go to other firms to receive the same quality of service, you’re positioned to negotiate higher prices. Furthermore, when the results are good, clients will recommend you. Word of mouth will earn you new business. Here’s an example: Alex’s business used to fulfill a broad range of requests – designing brochures, copywriting and search engine optimization. Taking a friend’s advice, Alex decided to concentrate on designing logos. He excelled at the work and his clients loved the product. As a result, Alex became a top logo designer. There’s another benefit to specializing: It allows you to hire the best people for the job. Why? Firms that provide multiple services have to hire experts for different fields. Smaller firms can’t afford to hire as many experts. Instead, they hire generalists to execute different tasks. However, since the employees don’t concentrate on a single field, they can’t deliver the best possible product. The quality never matches what’s produced by other firms, which can employ experts. Luckily, there’s a solution for smaller companies: by specializing, they can hire a few experts in a single area. Specializing helps your company produce excellent work, which puts you in a better position to negotiate with clients. And, perhaps more importantly, your company will run smoothly without too much oversight from you, because everyone will be responsible for discrete tasks. When you start a business, it’s natural to feel ownership. And when a company’s young, the founder is often involved in almost every aspect of the operation. But in order for the business to grow, customers shouldn’t associate the company entirely with its founder. What happens when you as a founder “become the business” in this way? When starting a company, you bear all the risks, so it’s understandable that you’ll want to handle many aspects of the operation on your own. Maybe you think that’s the best way to ensure that your employees don’t make mistakes. So you meet with every client and oversee all financial negotiations. As a result, your clients get used to talking about everything with you in person. For them, you represent the whole company. But this approach will lead to problems. When the company’s roster of clients grows, you won’t be able to lead the business effectively. If you spend all your time with clients, you won’t be able to focus on developing strategies for further growth. You probably won’t have time to manage employees or concentrate on things like financing. For example, Alex, our logo designer, struggled with a tight schedule because he met with every client in person. As a result, he didn’t have time to sit down with employees and discuss each customer’s specific needs. And since employees don’t tailor their work for each client, Alex’s company lost a lot of time when work had to be edited again and again. Plus, since Alex had to attend each meeting, it was difficult for him to go on vacation or take time off from work. As you can see, although it’s important for a founder to have an overview of business activities, the day-to-day operations should operate smoothly on their own. In a sense, the company’s founder should be replaceable. It all comes down to the bottom line, as the saying goes. Thus, a solid sales team is crucial to your business. Because having employees dedicated to sales not only generates money, it also frees the founder to actually lead the business. It’s vital to build a sales team comprising people who understand your service because they represent the firm to outsiders. How do you do that? Hire more than one salesperson. There are two reasons for this: First, healthy internal competition motivates employees to do their best work. By competing with each other for commissions, they’ll generate more business. Second, by having multiple salespeople, you’re minimizing risk in the event that someone gets sick or leaves town. Even smaller companies should have at least two good salespeople who understand how to sell their specific service. Finding such people can be tricky: For example, if you offer a standardized service, you need people who are good at selling products, not services. Take the case of Alex, who wants to specialize in logo design. This is a service, but he wants to sell it as a product with a standard process – meaning, his company follows the same production steps with each logo. As a result, he needs employees who are good at selling products. Typically, experienced service salespeople rely on consultative selling. That means they ask a lot of questions to find out what the clients needs. Consequently, clients expect them to provide individual solutions for their problems. But if you want to sell a standardized service, you can’t customize the product for each deal. That’s where product salespeople come in: These employees can influence the customer and make him believe that the standard product package is the perfect solution. Which is precisely what’s required for selling a standardized service. So once you have a smoothly running company that can operate independently of its owner, you can start thinking about how you’ll sell the business. How do you go about that? Who do you sell it to? And how do you get the best deal? Most entrepreneurs dream of one day selling their companies. But to pull off a sale and get the best deal, it’s essential to show potential buyers that you have a growing business with growing profits. One way to grow quickly is by finding big clients, but be careful about relying on them excessively. Why? Well, if you’re dependent on one big client, you’ll run into financial trouble anytime there’s an issue with the client’s payment. For example, 40 percent of Alex’s revenue came from MNY Bank. But one month, they were late on their payment, which made it difficult for Alex to pay monthly salaries and rent. Here’s another reason you shouldn’t rely on one big client: It puts you in a bad position to negotiate. From the perspective of a buying firm, that’s another major drawback. Why is this a disadvantage? Well, consider what happened when MNY Bank wanted to have something edited between Friday and Monday. Alex couldn’t risk losing a major client, so his designer was forced to work over the weekend. Eventually, the designer quits because of the unbearable working hours. Or another scenario: When Alex made the decision to specialize in logos, he took a big risk. If MNY Bank didn’t want logos, he would lose almost half of his revenue. As you can see, when your business is dependant on a bigger company, it limits your strategic decisions. This is especially unattractive to buyers, who want to develop a company and use its potential. No buying firm would want to acquire a small company that’s wholly dependant on a bigger company, especially because you’ll always have to do what the big company wants. If you don’t let big client companies force you into an overly dependant business relationship, your business will be far more attractive to buyers. In business, the customer is always right – but there are limits. Although every client might want a customized service, your small business will be better off if you offer standardized services. That’s because customized services are costly. From the first meeting to product delivery, the whole process can take months. And during that time, you’re not paid. That’s what happened to Alex. He had to edit some brochures for MNY Bank repeatedly because the client kept being dissatisfied with the results. It took ages for Alex to deliver the right product. And he wasn’t paid until he did. Thus, he struggled to find reserves to pay his monthly expenses. And there’s another benefit to standardized services: They give your business a better cash flow. Cash flow is the amount of money a firm has available in a certain period. It’s the difference between revenues and expenses, and it helps determine a company’s profitability. With standardized services, you’re paid upfront because the client knows what to expect from the final product. And that leads to positive cash flow, because you have money now and not in the future. Additionally, a positive cash flow is attractive from the perspective of buying firms, because it acts as a buffer if the company encounters larger unexpected expenses. Besides fostering positive cash flow, standardized services make it easier to estimate how long it’ll take to deliver a product, since you aren’t dependent on the customer. That way, you can better calculate how to allocate your time and resources. A calculated daily business is very attractive to buyers, because they can see that the company runs smoothly on its own. Finally, by limiting the number of times you meet with clients to tailor the work to their needs, you’re saving your company a lot of time. Up for a challenge? As an owner, it’s up to you to ensure that managers will want to stay with the company for a long time – even after it’s sold. Why is this so important? The purchasers will want to know that the firm will continue to succeed after its acquisition. And the management team plays a crucial role in that. In Alex’s case, he wanted to leave the company after the sale. That meant his management team had to run the company alone. Alex had three managers in charge of different departments. One was responsible for sales, one for designers and one for coordinating with the clients. If Alex left, those three managers would be the most important people in his company, because they oversaw all the daily tasks. If they stayed on, the business would continue to run as usual, so as the owner, Alex had to create incentives to retain them. One option is to give management equity, in the form of stock options. Stock options give managers the right to buy a specific amount of the company’s stock and therefore profit from its success. Stock options are a huge motivational tool because they make employees feel more invested in the company. However, stock options aren’t the best idea for smaller firms because they’re complicated to set up. So what’s an alternative? Long-term incentive plans that reward performance and loyalty are a better choice. For example, Ted told his friend Alex that he sets targets for his managers. When they reach their end-of-year targets, he pays them a bonus. He then matches the bonus with a sum he puts aside into a special fund. After three years, the employees are allowed to withdraw one third of the money – and so on, for each year after that. Thus, Ted ensures that management stays at the company. Ready to sell your company? Make sure you don’t overlook a crucial factor: the broker. The broker is the bridge between you and buyers. If he recommends you to the wrong companies, you won’t get a great price. What should you expect from your broker? The right broker will arrange discussions with different potential buyers. Consequently, the competition will result in a better price. Another benefit: you get to choose between buyers. Some companies buy for strategic reasons. That’s ideal for you because they’re more likely to pay a higher price, as well as give your business resources to grow. For example, Alex’s broker suggested they talk to printing companies, which might want to use his logo design business as a Trojan horse to get new clients – clients who would need printing services for their new logos. But other companies buy only for financial reasons. They want to see a return on investment, so they only care about quick financial success. These firms consider your price and the return they’ll get on it. They know they can buy any other potentially profitable firm, meaning they don’t care as much about your uniqueness or strategic outlook. So, a broker can play a major role in the successful sale of your company. But how do you choose one? It’s best to select a medium-sized broker firm. If it’s too big, your deal might not be so important for them and the broker won’t invest much time and effort to find the right buyer. On the other hand, if the firm is too small, the broker might not be respected by potential buyers. In that case, the negotiations also wouldn’t have a satisfying conclusion. Also, the right broker may have experience in your industry. Thus, he’ll know the landscape of competitors, the potentially interested firms and so on. It’s a big decision to make, but when you’re ready to sell your business, you need to start by writing a plan detailing your business model and expected cash flow. Bigger companies will use this to decide whether to acquire you, so it should present your firm in the best light. How should you do that? First: Think big! Make a three-year plan detailing what your company could achieve with unlimited resources. Why does this work? Well, the buying company will be larger than you are. It will have more employees, more resources and more money to run the business. With this added support, your company could achieve things it couldn’t on its own – including faster growth. This is a crucial point: The buying company wants to grow – that’s why it wants to acquire you. So tell them what’s possible and don’t be too modest. Here’s another thing that will present your company favorably to buyers: If your company concentrates on a standardized service, use words like “customers” and “business” rather than “clients” and “firm” when writing your plan. These small changes will make a big difference for buying firms. The word “clients” is associated with a normal service business and the word “customers” more with standardized businesses. Here’s why that matters: Service businesses are often acquired with a three- to five-year earn out. That means only a small amount of money is paid upfront. The rest comes later, if the company meets its goals. If not, the owner receives less money. The acquisition process for product businesses is different. The owners get the full amount of money upfront, without any earn out. This process involves less risk for the owner. If you’re an owner looking to sell your company, you probably want as much money as possible, now – not in a few years. Improve your chances with a well-written and savvy business plan. The key message in this book: Building a specialized service business attracts potential buyers. By hiring a robust sales force, growing a diverse roster of clients and creating strong incentives to reward management loyalty, you’re building a company that can be sold successfully. Actionable advice: Standardize your service. When you sell a standardized product to someone, the process is straightforward: They pay and you deliver. That’s so much simpler than the back-and-forth that takes place when you’re dealing with a customized service, which can sometimes take months to deliver, from first meeting to final product. Standardizing also ensures that you’re paid immediately, which saves you the complicated financial issues involved with having to remain afloat until the client is satisfied enough with the product to deliver a payment. With cash coming in upfront, you’ll be able to keep your finances organized. Suggested further reading: The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E.

    "author": "John Brooks",
    "summary": "After reading these blinks, you’ll understand why Bill Gates claimed that Business Adventures – which he received as a gift from Warren Buffett – was his favorite book of all time. After all, where else could he have found out what the launch of the world’s ugliest car, a wink from a General Electric company executive, and the fall of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain have in common? These and the other events described in this book represent several major developments in US business history, the repercussions of which can still be felt today. They paved the way for things like the end of insider trading and an employee’s right to work for whomever he or she pleases. In these twelve exciting and surprising case studies, you’ll find: how Wall Street almost killed off Piggly Wiggly, why shareholder meetings of large companies are usually a complete farce, and how a misinterpreted wink landed some GE executives in court. How much can a person miss in three days? Well, if you happened to be a stock market investor who fell into a three-day coma on May 28, 1962, you might have woken up to almost no noticeable change in your investments, but you also would’ve slept straight through the chaos of the 1962 Flash Crash. This three-day turmoil neatly illustrates how bizarre the behavior of Wall Street bankers can be, and how investors are guided more by their mood than actual facts. On May 28, 1962, the mood on Wall Street was distinctly glum after six months of stock market decline. There was a lot of trading going on that morning, and the central office was running late in updating stock prices, as this was done manually. Investors panicked when they realized they could only know a stock’s true price with a time lag of some 45 minutes, by which time they assumed the true price had fallen. Consequently, they rushed to sell off their shares, which created a downward spiral in prices. Their expectations became self-fulfilling, causing a crash that annihilated $20 billion in stock value. But just as emotions triggered the crash, they also helped move along the recovery: investors considered it common knowledge that the Dow Jones Index, which measured the value of the general stock market, could not go below 500 points. So when the value came close to that limit, a buying panic broke out as everyone expected prices to go up. Three days after the crash, the market had fully recovered. After this bizarre event, everyone was searching for rational explanations. But all stock exchange officials could come up with was that the government needed to pay more attention to the prevailing “business climate,” i.e., the mood and irrational expectations, of the financial market. This inherent irrationality translates into the market’s unpredictability. In fact, the only thing that can be predicted about the market is, to quote famous banker J.P. Morgan: “It will fluctuate.” Have you ever heard of the Ford Edsel? Originally intended to be Ford’s flagship product in the late 1950s, the car not only ended up being one of the most spectacular product failures of all time but is also frequently cited as one of the ugliest cars ever made. How could a company as successful as Ford fail so dismally? For one, it completely miscalculated the market. In 1955, the American automobile market was booming. Families’ disposable income was increasing and people were becoming more interested in medium-priced cars, a segment in which Ford was weak. That’s when the company started planning the Ford Edsel. Unfortunately, by the time the Edsel was launched in 1958, the market had done a 180: an economic downturn and an abrupt change in consumer tastes had made people flock to smaller and cheaper car models. A second reason for the failure was that customers had unrealistic expectations for the car. Ford had spent $250 million on planning the Edsel, making it the company’s most expensive project up to that point – a fact that Ford promoted extensively in its marketing. This created a lot of buzz around the project, so when the Edsel was finally launched, consumers were expecting something revolutionary. However, they were disappointed to see that the Edsel was just another four-wheeled automobile after all. The third and final strike for the Edsel was its shoddy build. Since Ford had spent most of its efforts on carrying out psychological research to make the car appealing to its target group (i.e., young families with a disposable income), it neglected to fine-tune the technical side of the car. Consequently, once the product launched, customers found several faults, ranging from unreliable brakes to a jumpy acceleration. Although the Edsel might not have been a completely useless car in the end, it just couldn’t live up to its expectations. Warren Buffett is one of the richest people on the planet, and yet he admits that his tax rate is lower than his secretary’s (whose income, naturally, amounts to far less than his). Sound like a cruel joke? Well, it’s the perfect example of how unfair the US federal income tax system is. To understand how it got so bad, let’s examine the increasingly twisted development of the system since its inception. In 1913, after decades of political debate and fears that it was tantamount to socialism, the federal government began to levy an income tax. The reason was that its own income stream had run dry while its expenses were increasing. Initially, income tax rates were low and the main contributors were the richest citizens. Since then, rates have been raised continually and the application of the tax expanded to larger swathes of the population and, at the same time, more and more loopholes were created for the rich. These days, the income tax rates are generally quite high and have the greatest effect on the middle-class population. The way the tax is structured today encourages inefficiency. For example, freelancers will often stop taking on new contracts mid-way through the year just to not earn more income because, from a tax perspective, it makes more sense than earning more. What’s more, the complicated system of loopholes has made enforcing taxation a battle. The Internal Revenue Service, which collects the tax, must annually contend with an army of citizens’ tax advisers and lawyers whose speciality is circumventing the tax code. This is a colossal waste of human resources on both sides. Unfortunately though, tax reform is politically unfeasible. Multiple presidents have tried to reform the tax code into something simpler, but all have failed. The current system simply favors too many rich people with too much influence, and they don’t want to relinquish their advantages, such as capital gains being taxed less than salary income. So what’s the solution? The federal income tax system needs to be reset back to its 1913 state so we can try again. Imagine your uncle works for an oil company and he calls you up one day to tell you to invest in his company’s stock, as they’ve just struck oil and will only announce it tomorrow. Sounds like, if you bought the stock, you could end up doing time for insider trading, right? That would hold true today, but it wouldn’t necessarily have been that way before the Texas Gulf case. In 1959, a mineral company called Texas Gulf Sulphur hit the jackpot in the wilderness of Ontario, Canada. Their preliminary test drilling indicated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of copper, silver and other minerals in the ground. The people who knew about the find decided to keep quiet about it, stealthily buying shares in Texas Gulf. And as executives and other people in the know began buying shares, they instructed their relatives to do the same. When rumors spread that the company may have discovered something substantial, Texas Gulf held a press conference to actively downplay the hearsay and spread disinformation – as its own executives continued to buy shares. When the company finally announced the news about its find, the price of the shares skyrocketed and everyone who had bought the company’s stock got very wealthy. While this behavior wasn’t considered ethical, even by Wall Street standards, insider trading laws hadn’t ever been properly enforced before. This time though, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action: it charged Texas Gulf with deception and insider trading. This unprecedentedly bold step angered many investors. At the trial, the court had to decide whether or not the results of the test drilling had made the value of the find clear, and whether the company’s subsequent pessimistic press releases were deliberately misleading. In the end, the court issued a guilty verdict along with a statement that the public needs to be afforded a “reasonable opportunity to react” to any news that will affect share prices before company insiders can start trading shares. From then on, insider trading has been regulated and Wall Street has become a little cleaner. In the early 1960s, the automatic copy machine was a huge hit and the product’s developer, Xerox, suddenly became the market leader. But, within just a few years, the company experienced a huge downfall. Let’s take a look at Xerox’s rollercoaster ride in three stages. First, there was initial success against all the odds. Traditionally, people weren’t interested in copying documents because they felt like they were stealing original content. What’s more, the process was expensive, since the first copy machines would only run on specially treated paper. So when Xerox launched its first plain-paper photocopier in 1959, nobody expected a high demand for the product. The company’s founders even went so far as to discourage their friends and family from investing in the company. Yet in just six years, the company’s revenues had skyrocketed to $500 million. Second, there was sustained period of success. Xerox became so confident that it started investing heavily in philanthropy. As is fairly typical for an overnight success, the owners wanted to show their gratitude to those who had helped them and use their newly acquired position to influence society. For example, Xerox became the second-largest donor to the University of Rochester, which had originally helped develop photocopying technology. What’s more, the owners seemed to care a great deal for the United Nations. In 1964, they spent $4 million on a television campaign supporting the UN after it came under public attack by right-wing politicians. In the third stage, Xerox was forced to see how quickly success can turn into defeat. Shortly after reaching the peak of its glory in 1965, Xerox realized it was in trouble. The technological lead it had over competitors had diminished as they were producing cheaper copycat products. What’s more, new investments into research and development were ineffective, which left the company stranded. These three stages are a poignant example of the many stages a growth company can potentially go through. Luckily for Xerox, it survived the third stage and is still successful today. In late 1963, the brokerage company Ira Haupt & Co. was in trouble. It no longer had sufficient capital to trade in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and its membership had to be revoked. The reason for this predicament was that the brokerage, which traded in commodities, had made a disastrous deal. It had bought cottonseed and soybean oil to be delivered at a later point in time and used the warehouse receipts as collateral to borrow money from the bank. Unfortunately, it turned out that the receipts had been doctored and the oil did not actually exist. Ira Haupt & Co. was suddenly the victim of large-scale commercial fraud and unable pay back the massive debt. After meeting with several banks, shareholders and the NYSE, it was found that Ira Haupt & Co. needed $22.5 million to become solvent again. To make matters worse, the entire nation was in a panic: President Kennedy had just been shot and the market was declining. But instead of letting Ira Haupt & Co. go bankrupt, the NYSE did something unprecedented: they saved the brokerage. The NYSE worried that the bankruptcy of Ira Haupt & Co. in a time of national panic would cause people to quickly lose faith in their investments and send Wall Street into a crash. They felt that the nation’s welfare depended on the survival of the brokerage, so they worked with the NYSE member firms and the brokerage’s creditors to hammer out a plan for Ira Haupt & Co. to pay back its debts. The NYSE itself pledged $7.5 million, almost a third of its total reserves. Together with other lenders it managed to save Ira Haupt. It is unlikely that we’ll ever see the NYSE make such a bold move ever again, but at the time it prevented a financial crisis in the heat of national panic. These days, whenever a company is mired in a scandal, they’ll claim that nobody did anything wrong – that the true culprit is “communication problems.” For example, if a company dumps toxic waste into an aquifer, it’s not out of greed, but because “The board failed to properly communicate the new environmental strategy to the local managers.” One case where this claim was put to the test was in the late 1950s when General Electric (GE) engaged in large-scale price fixing. No fewer than 29 electronics companies colluded to fix prices of $1.75 billion worth of machinery sold, with over a half a billion dollars coming from public institutions. The fixing could typically cost the customer as much as 25 percent more than normal price. When it turned out that GE was the ringleader of the price fixers, the scandalous matter was brought before the court and a senate subcommittee. Though some managers faced fines and prison terms, no higher level executives were charged. Why not? They claimed it was all due to a communication error: middle managers had misinterpreted their instructions. Apparently, at the time, there were two types of policies accepted at GE: official ones and implied ones. If executives gave you an order with a straight face, it was an official policy you should follow. But if they winked at you as they gave an order, the interpretation was up to you. Typically you were supposed to do the exact opposite of what was said, but other times you had to guess what the executive was implying. And if you failed to deduce what was implied, you’d be the one in trouble. Because of this, even though GE had a policy that forbade discussing prices with competitors, many managers assumed it was mere window dressing. But once they landed in court for the price fixing, they realized they couldn’t blame the executives. This story shows us that executives can, indeed, use communication problems to fend off responsibility for all manner of illegalities. Unless you live in the southern or midwestern United States, chances are you’ve never heard of Piggly Wiggly. Either way, in 1917, it patented the concept of the self-service supermarket. It was the first supermarket to, for example, provide shoppers with shopping carts, put price tags on all the items and have check-out stands. Piggly Wiggly still operates today, but is relatively unknown due to the actions of its eccentric owner Clarence Saunders, who went to great lengths to fight financial speculation. In the 1920s, Piggly Wiggly was rapidly expanding throughout the United States. But when a couple of franchises in New York failed in 1923, some investors tried to take advantage of this by starting a bear raid against Piggly Wiggly. A bear raid is a strategy where investors make investments that only turn a profit if a company’s stock price falls and then do everything in their power to force the price of the stock down. In Piggly Wiggly’s case, they claimed the whole company was in trouble due to the failed New York franchises. Saunders was furious and wanted to teach Wall Street a lesson: he started an attempt to corner Piggly Wiggly’s stock, meaning he wanted to buy back the majority of it. And he almost succeeded. He announced publicly that he would buy all existing stock in Piggly Wiggly and, after borrowing heavily, managed to buy back 98 percent of the shares. This drove up the stock price from $39 to $124 per share: a catastrophe for the bear raiders, who faced enormous losses when the price rose. However, the raiders managed to convince the stock exchange to grant them an extension on paying up. Saunders’ position was not tenable due to his debts, and he eventually suffered such large losses he was forced to declare bankruptcy. If only Saunders would’ve had more influence over the stock exchange, you might be wiggling yourself through the aisles of a Piggly Wiggly instead of shopping at a big box store like Wal-Mart. When a highly influential government bureaucrat jumps over to the business world and leverages his old government connections to make money, many people are likely to accuse him of being a sell-out. But in the case of David Lilienthal, this wouldn’t be an appropriate accusation. In the 1930s, Lilienthal was a good civil servant under the reformist President Roosevelt. Then, in 1941, he was appointed chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, an entity in charge of developing and distributing cheap hydroelectric power in areas that private providers didn’t cover. Later, in 1947, he served as the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, emphasizing the importance of the peaceful civilian use of nuclear power. And, when he finally left public office In 1950, he was honest about his motivation for the move, saying he wanted to make more money so he could provide for his family and save for his own retirement. Once he entered the private sector, Lilienthal also proved himself a committed businessman. His background in energy made him well-suited for the mineral industry and, since he wanted to experience the trials of entrepreneurship, he took over the severely ailing Minerals and Chemical Corporation of America. He succeeded in bringing the company back to life from the brink of failure and earned a small fortune as a result. His new line of work also influenced his own opinions: he wrote a controversial book about why big business is important for the economy and security of the United States. His old government colleagues accused him of being a sell-out, but Lilienthal was merely highly committed to both sides of the coin. Eventually, Lilienthal decided that he wanted the best of both worlds and, in 1955, founded the Development and Resources Corporation, a consultancy that helped developing countries carry out major public works programs. This latest endeavor proves that Lilienthal really is the ideal businessman: accountable in equal measure to both shareholders and humanity. Who do you think are the most powerful people in America? In theory, it should be the stockholders. Especially given the fact that they own the largest corporations in America and these giant companies wield such great power in American society that many political scientists have suggested that the United States resembles an oligarchic feudal system more than a democracy. These major corporations are always led by a board of directors elected by the shareholders, giving the shareholders the true power. Once a year, shareholders come together for an annual meeting in order to elect the board, vote on policies and question the executives who run the company. But, far from being the dignified, serious events you might imagine, these meetings are generally a complete farce. That’s because the company’s management doesn’t really feel that the shareholders are their bosses. They make it hard for shareholders to come to meetings by holding them far away from the company’s headquarters. At the meetings, they try to to keep the shareholders from getting involved by droning on about the company’s great performance and future. This tactic works with most shareholders. The only thing that makes these meetings interesting are the professional investors who challenge the company board and management into a debate. One comic example was seen in AT&T’s 1965 shareholders’ meeting, when investor Wilma Soss berated the chairman of the board Frederick Kappel and even suggested he see a psychiatrist. Professional investors like Soss often own stock in many companies and thus want to hold them accountable for their actions. In this case, Soss was fighting to get more women on the board of directors. But trying to rouse apathetic investors is a thankless job: there is nothing more passive and compliant than a small investor who is fed dividends regularly. If shareholders only wielded their power more often, company management could not simply do as they please. If one day you were to receive a highly tempting job offer from a competitor of your current employer, you’d be able to accept it, right? Actually, your right to do so was not always so clear, and you have a research scientist named Donald Wohlgemuth to thank for setting the precedent that allows you to do as you please. In 1962, Wohlgemuth managed the space suit engineering department of the aerospace company B.F. Goodrich Company. The market for space-related products was growing fast during the race for the moon, and Goodrich was the market leader in space suits. At the time, though, the company had just lost the contract for the now famous Apollo project to its main competitor International Latex. So when Wohlgemuth received an offer from International Latex to work on the prestigious Apollo project with more responsibility and a larger salary, he accepted without delay. But when Wohlgemuth told his superiors at B.F. Goodrich that he was leaving, they feared that he would divulge the secrets he had learned about space suit production. Due to this fear and the fact that Wohlgemuth had originally signed a confidentiality agreement, B.F. Goodrich then sued Wohlgemuth. When the controversial matter went to court, two key questions of near-philosophical nature arose: If someone hasn’t ever broken an agreement or shown the intention of doing so, can action be taken against them on the assumption that they will? Should someone be prohibited from pursuing a position that would tempt them to commit a crime? In a groundbreaking decision, the judge ruled that while Wohlgemuth clearly was in a position to harm Goodrich by sharing what he knew, he could not be found guilty of it preemptively, and so was free to enter into employment with International Latex. This decision formed the precedent for similar rulings, making it a great victory for employee rights. In the 1960s, of all the currencies of the world, the British pound sterling was perhaps one of the most prestigious due to its old age and high value. So when the pound came under attack from financial speculators in 1964, central bankers around the world felt obliged to defend it. The roots of the attack go back to the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, when the major economies of the world decided to build an international monetary exchange system where all currencies were exchangeable at fixed rates. This meant that, to maintain these fixed rates, governments had to often intervene in the currency exchange market by buying or selling currencies. In 1964, Britain found itself in economic difficulties: it was running a large trade deficit. Currency speculators believed that Britain could not keep up the fixed currency exchange rates and would be forced to devalue the pound. Consequently, they started betting against the pound in the market: they wanted its value to fall. Faced not only with the threat to the prestigious pound sterling but also to the international monetary exchange system itself, a broad alliance of monetary policy makers led by the US Federal Reserve mounted a defense. They started to buy pounds to counteract the pressure to devalue the currency. Initially, it seemed as if the tactic was working, and the first waves of attacks were fended off. But the speculators were persistent, continuing their attacks for years. Finally, in 1967, the alliance could not afford to buy more pounds, and Britain was forced to devalue the currency by over 14 percent. In hindsight, the war over the valuation of the pound sterling was merely the first sign of the inherent shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system, which would come to an end just four years later in 1971. The key message in this book: In many cases, how we understand the financial market and business ethics can be traced back to key incidents in history. One man’s fight to change employers, for example, made a lasting impact on employee rights.",

    "title": "Business Execution for RESULTS",
    "author": "Stephen Lynch",
    "summary": "It’s easy to come up with a grand, ambitious goal, like developing and marketing a new drug for the pharmaceutical industry or positioning yourself as a leading architect known throughout the world. Making it a reality, though, is a whole different ballgame. To attain your goal, you will likely have to work very long hours for a quite a few years. But even hard work does not always yield fruit. Start-ups often go bust after three to five years of continued efforts, while many dedicated business professionals end up spending long hours in the office without having anything to show for it in the end. This happens because success must be carefully planned. These blinks will show you that you’ll need short-term, intermediate and long-term goals, and also identify the right tools to reach your goals. You’ll also learn how to stay excited about big hairy audacious goals; how to recognize the best opportunities in your business environment; and how to create a focus for your company that will ensure its success. Have you heard the term Big Hairy Audacious Goals, or BHAGs? It was coined by Jerry I. Porras and Jim Collins in their book Built to Last. To qualify as a BHAG, a goal needs to meet four criteria: It needs to be very big, take years to accomplish, be a little bit elusive in terms of the best way to attain it and must be easy to identify if it’s been achieved or not. Consider Wal-Mart. Following World War II, the company’s founder, Sam Walton, set a remarkably bold goal; he wanted to turn his tiny variety store in Newport, Arkansas into the most profitable one in the entire state. Since he was primarily selling cheap T-shirts and fishing rods at the time, this was a pretty audacious goal. It also wasn’t something he could achieve in a matter of months, and it wasn’t immediately clear how he could set about doing it. Finally, in terms of verifying his potential accomplishment, it would be easy to check the size and profit of his growing business against other stores in Arkansas. By 1948, Walton had achieved his incredible vision – his store was the most profitable of any variety store in Arkansas. From there, he just kept setting goals and, decades down the line, by 2002, Wal-Mart had become the largest company on the face of the earth. So, do as Sam did and identify your own BHAG. But a BHAG is not necessarily about growing your company; it can also be related to a specific product or project. In 1934, Walt Disney set out to create the very first animated, feature-length film. No one in the industry believed in this bold project because animation was only considered suitable for short films. History proved them wrong. Disney reached his goal when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released in 1938. People loved it. And even though Disney’s original goal hadn’t been revenue, the film did generate massive returns. Next up, you’ll learn about two key concepts that are at the foundation of your business. Imagine your dream is to build a cathedral. To achieve this incredible goal, would you hire people who simply know how to lay bricks or people who are wholeheartedly committed to building a stunning architectural masterpiece. Probably the latter, right? After all, having a unifying purpose is essential to forging commitment and building a thriving business. This central motivation is called a core purpose and it’s key to reaching your goals. For instance, as an architect, your core purpose might be to beautify cities or to build environmentally sustainable houses. Simply put, your core purpose infuses your work with meaning, while gathering energy and solidifying commitments in the process. This is an important factor since the more committed a team is, the more likely they are to achieve extraordinary results. In fact, the employee research firm ISR found that companies with an engaged workforce are more productive and profitable overall. So, your core purpose is a fundamental aspect of achieving your stated goals, but so are your core values. These values constitute your company’s moral compass; they ensure consistent decision making and guide your hiring and firing practices. In other words, your core values dictate how your company operates. Say you run a taxi company. Your core values might be summed up by the phrase, the right route is the right route. Such a value will indicate that your team doesn’t take detours to jack up fares. By stating this up front, you’ll keep your team on solid moral footing and ensure that they are committed to making the right decisions. But your values will also guide who is on your team in the first place. If it turns out that an employee doesn’t believe in the values you stand for, it is clearly the right decision to let them go. Imagine you’ve invested every last drop of your ingenuity into creating a deli that only sells broccoli jam. Your business could be perfectly organized and seamlessly run, but it wouldn’t matter if nobody wants what you’re selling. So, how do you determine which products will sell? By scanning your environment with a PEST analysis. This acronym, which stands for Political, Economic, Social and Technological, is a tool to define external factors that will impact your industry. To begin with, consider political circumstances that might impact your business, both today and down the line. From there, ask yourself, given the political opportunities and threats you can identify, which strategies should you adopt to succeed both in the present day and the future? For instance, in the 1960s, Sam Walton analyzed the environment Wal-Mart was entering. He realized that the US government was making a number of infrastructural investments, one of which was the creation of more roads. He therefore knew that it would become easier for customers to reach his stores and that it was a good time to open new locations. Next, you should consider economic factors that’ll influence your business and ask yourself the same question about the economic climate as you did about the political one. Sam Walton remains a good example as, in the years following World War II, he saw the economy surging and knew it was an opportune time to launch a new business. From there, it’s essential to take into account social elements that’ll impact your company. To do so, consider how people, your employees and, in particular, your customers act and think. Ask questions like, is the population getting older or younger? When Walton was starting out, it was clear that more people were having children. He saw that the baby boom would eventually result in more potential customers and was another cue that the time was right to grow. Finally, consider technological changes that might occur and how they could affect your business. Which technologies are currently trending? If a new technology like, say, flying bicycles was to hit the market tomorrow, how would it affect your business? Now that you’ve asked the right questions and set the stage, you’re ready to make some bigger decisions – which is exactly what you’ll learn about next. If you want to stand out in a crowd, all you’ve got to do is dye your hair pink and spike it into a mohawk. But standing out in the world of business requires a bit more thought. To do so, you need to identify your value discipline, the thing that makes you different from the competition and guarantees you a leading role in your industry. There are three different value disciplines to choose from and it’s up to you to pick the one that fits you best. First, there’s operational excellence, which basically means that you have low costs. Second is product leadership, which is all about creating the newest and best products. And third, there’s customer intimacy, which implies that you produce solutions that are perfectly tailored to the problems your customers face. But regardless of which approach you choose, all three of these value disciplines should keep you focused on the unique difference that makes you stand out. Let’s return to Sam Walton. Back in the early 60s, he began building his empire and decided to focus on offering the low-cost option. Specifically, he made the decision to spend some of his own savings to be able to offer rock bottom prices to his customers. His goal was for Wal-Mart to be the store that everybody could afford; in the end, that’s exactly how the company differentiated itself and became such a resounding success. Then, once you’ve chosen your value discipline, you can use it to identify your core activities. These are the strategic actions you take to keep yourself on the path toward your goals. Imagine you decide to focus on low prices as Walton did. Other factors like product development and customer service will soon become less important, as they’re not essential to reaching your goals. Identifying this will allow you to deliberately allocate fewer resources to these unnecessary elements and instead focus on getting better deals from wholesalers to lower your retail prices. By doing so, you’ll be syncing your core activities with your value discipline. Now that you’ve got the basics in order, you’re ready to build the messages you need to bring in prospective customers and beat out the competition. You might be thinking, what’s a good goal to set for your business? Well, it’s actually a difficult question to answer, since words like “good” are quite abstract and can mean entirely different things to different people. This is precisely why it’s crucial to come up with concrete ways of measuring your business’s progress – and numerical targets are an ideal method. Numbers make progress more tangible and, therefore, easier to monitor. Say two of your targets in the coming years are to build two more branch offices and acquire ten more resellers. Once you’ve set such goals, you can track the numbers you’re putting up and have your whole team monitor the progress. But that’s not all. You’ll also need to identify your key performance indicators, or KPIs. These all-important markers of success keep track of performance in essential areas and help you predict financial success. For example, if you’re in the construction business and notice a correlation between higher numbers of proposals and an increase in income, you might want to track the number of building proposals you submit as a KPI. Or, if your industry is pharmaceutical sales, you might track the number of weekly physician's visits that your sales representatives make because you know it has been a key indicator of your business success in the past. By now you have some strong strategies for business success, but if you want to reach your BHAGs, you’ll need to be serious about maintaining progress. In that fight, losing focus and wasting time are your biggest enemies – so here are some tactics to overcome them: First, conducting meetings is central to maintaining forward momentum, as they establish a clear rhythm for your business. While the idea of holding many meetings can be daunting, in general, they give you time to pause and reassess your direction; these regular moments of reflection can quickly become essential to a thriving business. One meeting that’s particularly important is the quarterly strategic review. It should happen every three months to give your team the opportunity to look back on the work you did and assess the last quarter. It’s a time to consider what you’ve achieved, review new projects on the docket and take a look at any surprises that came up. By assessing all these factors, you can double-check that everything you’re doing is in line with your goals. From there, you can use this information to perform what’s called a SWOT Analysis, which is a convenient way to map the current status of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. For instance, one of your strengths might be an expert on your team, while a weakness could be your failure to make enough sales. An opportunity might be the bankruptcy of a key competitor, which opens the door for you to bring in more customers, and a threat might be a pending merger between companies that, together, could poach many of your customers. From there, you can use your quarterly review and SWOT analysis to plan for the future and choose the projects you’ll be launching in the next quarter. Imagine you identify a few threats and weaknesses during your SWOT analysis. It’s probably in your best interests to address these in the next quarter; then, once you’ve gone through damage control, you can look at which new projects you want to take on to stay on top of your overarching, ultimate goals. The key message in this book: Creating a successful business requires a winning strategy that enables you to set the right goals and actually reach them – but that’s easier said than done. To pick the right strategy, you’ll need to do some careful thinking and analysis first, after which you’ll have to monitor your progress carefully. Actionable Advice Involve your entire team in strategic research. When analyzing your business, including the PEST analysis, ask everyone in your team for their opinion. With more minds involved, it’ll be easier to identify the most important aspects in need of consideration and pin down a winning strategy. So involve everyone you can in this process and don’t go it alone – you might miss something important. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Challenging Coaching",
    "author": "John Blakey and Ian Day",
    "summary": "Coaching became popular in the 1980s as a direct consequence of the “war over talent.” As the economy became more knowledge based, the development and retention of top talent became necessary for success. So companies started hiring coaches to ensure that their employees reached their full potential. But have you ever asked yourself: from where did coaching appear? Coaching developed from existing support-oriented professions like counselling and psychotherapy that are based on certain core-principles, such as being non-directive, and helping clients find their own solutions. These principles are effective for helping people in need of care, but are they effective in the case of coaching? Challenging Coaching argues that this approach might have led self-obsessed financial traders to focus only on their own personal rewards – with catastrophic results for their companies, and even for the financial market as a whole. So what’s wrong with the old approach? Traditional coaching tends to fuel leaders’ egos with praise, rather than challenging them with honest feedback. And instead of focusing on accountability and the bigger picture, traditional coaches just help the client fulfill their personal goals, and stand back when they see their client breaking their own values. Challenging Coaching believes this has to change. In the following blinks, you’ll find out:   how traditional coaching works,    what its original inspirations were,    how those roots are holding it back, and    what a better alternative looks like: the FACTS approach, which moves away from myth-based coaching to a model that actually works.   Even though it might seem to have existed forever, the coaching profession is actually still in its teenage years. When it first emerged in the 1980s, it was still very much a toddler, and easily influenced by its older peers – like psychotherapy and counselling. This influence means that coaching shares a core foundation with support-oriented counselling disciplines where the client gets unconditional positive backing. For example, active listening and powerful questioning are the two skill sets that are fundamentally required for counselling, mentoring, therapy – and coaching. These skills are considered necessary for developing an understanding of a client’s needs – which is the starting point of all progress – and helping them find their own answers, which is key to self-determination, a major value of support-oriented disciplines. But when coaching was born, it knew none of all this. So, in search of orientation, coaching took its biggest inspiration from person-centered therapy. Person-centered therapy was developed by Carl Rogers, one of the most influential therapists of the twentieth century, renowned for his humanist methodology. His non-directive approach is based on the fundamental belief that a client already possesses the vast resources necessary for development. The therapist's role is to help the client find their own solutions by creating a safe space for growth using empathy (seeing through another’s eyes), congruence (being completely open and honest) and unconditional, non-judgmental positive regard. These principles have become the foundation for traditional coaching models. For example, the popular Co-Active Coaching model significantly overlaps with Carl Rogers’ principles: the client is considered naturally resourceful, the agenda comes from the client, and the relationship is an alliance designed for the client’s growth. Another example is the well-known GROW model, which also shares its main assumptions with Rogers: The client is considered able to find their own solutions, empathy is focused to create a safe space, and understanding is developed through non-directive questioning. The newborn coaching profession was able to derive its methods and ethos from the theoretically established and practically proven foundations of psychotherapy and counselling. These predecessors have influenced coaching down to its core, and coaching literature widely agrees on three support-orientated principles that are emphasized as fundamentally important: \nThe nondirective approach. This principle assumes that the client – and not the coach – is the expert of their own situation: the client has the answers to her own problems, and the coach merely helps uncover them. The coach’s role is therefore to ask questions, listen, reflect, offer support and empower the client rather than problem-solve for them and give advice. \nRespecting the client’s agenda. This principle states that the coach must resist directing the client's agenda – even if they think that doing so would help. Fundamentally, it is always the client who decides which topics and areas are to be worked on – not the coach. \nBuilding rapport. Traditional coaches believe that effective progress can only happen on a foundation of strong empathy between the coach and client. The building of such a bond is assumed to lead to the fundamental trust and rapport necessary to create a safe space to grow. But while psychotherapy has gone through many paradigm shifts since its creation, and has constantly updated its core principles, coaching still holds on to its founding principles. Are these still up to date? Or is it time for change? Read on to find out. We’ve now learned about the origins of traditional coaching. But what if its fundamental principles are flawed to their very core? What if these principles need to be challenged? FACTS coaching believes that traditional coaching’s core principles hinder progress. To begin with, the nondirective approach is a myth: even with limited interactions, a coach inevitably influences the client. And if a client is stuck, the nondirective approach will leave them there far longer than necessary. By abandoning the nondirective approach, the coach could use their expertise to make suggestions that could stimulate new solutions. Then there are the limiting effects of sticking to the client’s agenda. For example, clients sometimes avoid difficult issues that must be tackled to overcome other problems. By moving beyond the client’s agenda, a coach is empowered to challenge those issues head on. Finally, even if building rapport is key to the coaching relationship, it should not get in the way of clients reaching their full potential. Rapport is fundamental for helping the often sensitive and dysfunctional clients who require psychotherapy and counselling. Coaching, however, often deals with robust people who can be pushed to their limits. This is why coaches must be allowed to take clients out their comfort zones to break through growth barriers. By limiting itself to these principles, traditional coaching can lead to the drastic consequences of collusion, irrelevance and self-obsession. An overly supportive, non-judgemental coach colludes with the client. This coach aligns with the client’s world view and fails to offer feedback from a different perspective – even when the client has got things wrong. And if coaches always hold on to the client’s agenda, this can lead to irrelevant work. Coaching sessions become time-killers instead of a push for the right outcome for the company as a whole. When these two approaches are combined, clients learn to focus solely on their own situation, and can become self-obsessive. When leaders focus too narrowly on their own agenda, this often leads to negative consequences for the wider organization – as we’ll see in a later blink. Have you ever had a teacher who became a good friend? Who filled your lessons with laughter and joy? That’s great – but for the sake of your progress, it might have been better if you had felt challenged rather than entertained, and had seriously tackled your weaknesses instead of focusing on fun. The same logic can be applied for coaching. FACTS-based coaching aims to find the right balance of challenge and support, in contrast to traditional coaching, which focuses too much on support. This lack of challenge leads to limited action, because taking risks could mean disrupting the cosy coach–client bond. So what can be done? The key to growth is to provide ambitious challenges with equally high levels of support. Not challenging the client will only lead to small results, as there are no big goals to reach, and just giving clients huge challenges without support will only lead to stress and failure. Growth happens when the coach sets goals that challenge the client and supports her in reaching them. One way FACTS-based coaches challenge their clients is by leaving the comfort zone of traditional coaching for areas of new growth. Coaching conversations usually take place in a “zone of comfortable debate,” because beyond that, things feel tense and harder to control. But to tackle issues at their heart, it’s necessary to enter the ZOUD: the “Zone of Uncomfortable Debate.” Being able to enter and sustain the ZOUD without damaging the coach–client relationship is a key component of FACTS-based coaching. To do so the coach must be challenging yet respectful, empathetic yet growth orientated. Now that we’ve explored what’s wrong with traditional coaching, let’s explore the core concepts of the FACTS approach. There are three main reasons why traditional coaches don’t provide honest feedback: 1. Feedback might have been experienced as judgmental. We’ve all felt angry when someone has criticized us, which can make us reluctant to make suggestions of our own. 2. The coach is not confident in his or her feedback skills. Not all coaching training courses include feedback training, which leaves a lot of coaches lacking a core skill. 3. Finally, the coach does not feel they have the client’s permission to give feedback. But not giving challenging, honest feedback is a risk – because feedback is quintessential for the client’s progress. Why? Firstly, feedback can uncover “blind spots.” Another person’s perspective is sometimes the fastest way of bringing an issue to light, even if it’s something simple: that piece of broccoli between your teeth is something you can easily solve, but only if you know about it! Feedback can also uncover so called “no go” areas. These are issues that clients are sometimes aware of, but prefer to ignore. Having somebody to keep you on track can jolt these issues back into the forefront of your mind, and help you tackle them head on. Finally, feedback is a powerful tool for preventing bad decisions. Confident business leaders are often surrounded by employees who are afraid of giving them negative feedback. Coaches can then play the role of delivering the honest, bad news. So how can a coach overcome their initial fear of feedback? 1. By ensuring that feedback is non-judgemental: by critiquing the client’s behavior instead of their personality, coaches can increase the receptivity of their feedback. 2. There are also well-established process models for providing feedback that coaches can learn. One example is the four stage approach: Observe the facts, judge their impact, invite the client to a conversation about your observations and assumptions, and agree on future action. 3. Finally, just ask if you may! If your client is not open to feedback, it’s better to find out sooner rather than later. During the oil spill crisis in Louisiana, BP’s CEO Tony Hayward found himself at the eye of a political storm. Giving his testimony before the US Congress, he distanced himself from the company’s mistakes and struggled to recall any of the events he was asked about. His behavior provoked fury among not only the direct victims of the oil spill, but also the public at large. This kind of behavior has led society to demand greater transparency and accountability on a governmental and economic level. Political parties and major public debates have even formed based on these issues – for example, the Pirate Party and Snowden’s NSA revelations both revolve around this topic. One key element of these new public demands has been the accountability of business leaders. But what business leaders often lack is somebody to actually hold them accountable. This is where coaches come into play. Coaches must move beyond traditional models where clients hold themselves responsible to a new model of holding their clients responsible on a personal and corporate level. For example, specific commitments must be agreed upon in contracts. If major decisions at BP had been committed in writing to their respective decision makers, the chain-of-command wouldn’t have been as unclear as it was revealed to be when the crisis struck. And maybe the decisions would have been made differently in the first place if somebody’s name was attached to them. But beyond this, coaches need to hold their clients accountable to the larger commitments their organization has made – for example, their organization’s mission statement, corporate values and social responsibility agenda. In May 1961, US President John F. Kennedy stood before Congress and proclaimed that the United States “should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” But a traditional coach would never have agreed with Kennedy on setting this goal. Why? Because traditional goal-setting processes inhibit great outcomes. Traditional goal setting uses popular guidelines like SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed, Realistic, Timed) and PRISM (Personal, Realistic, Interesting, Specific, Measurable), which focus on rational, realistic goals. While this focus does lead to reliable outcomes within a predetermined range, its aversion to risk inhibits transformation on a bigger scale: aiming only for \"realistic\" goals prevents the leap of faith necessary for huge innovations – like taking man to the moon. The truth is that setting courageous goals leads to real transformation – which is not only desirable, but necessary. Why? Because in a global and fast-changing economy, businesses need to be more flexible than ever before. And to successfully transform their organizations, clients need the creativity and courage to tackle the unknown – resources which can only be unleashed by setting bold goals. Traditional goals might be to “increase sales by ten percent in the next quarter,” but that’s not enough to satisfy today’s big players. The late Steve Jobs is famous for wanting to “put a ding in the Universe” at Apple; Facebook set out to connect the whole world; and Amazon is trying to sell everything to everyone. These companies aren’t simply naive: they are courageous. Alexander Karelin felt pretty relaxed. At the 2000 Olympic Games he was the three-time defending champion of Greco-Roman wrestling, and had never lost a single match in his 15 years of international competition. His opponent in the finals, Rulon Gardner, had never finished higher than fifth in any international wrestling competition, and was arguably perceived as the easiest opponent Karelin had ever to face in a final match. But although Alexander Karelin had won 887 wrestling matches, he lost this one. There was no cheating, no injury, no bad luck – nothing out of the ordinary. So why did he lose? Some thought he was too nervous. But after more than 80 victories and three Olympic finals with more threatening opponents, this is highly unlikely. In fact, the opposite might be true: he was probably not nervous enough. This agrees with the FACTS perspective that tension is necessary for optimal performance. Traditional coaching’s techniques and values, having emerged from the supportive counselling disciplines, focus on reducing stress and tension. The traditional coaching approach to Karelin’s final match would have been to worry about the potential pressure he was feeling, and do their best to dissipate it. But countless psychological findings confirm that everybody has an optimal level in between anxiety and comfort where they enter a state of flow and peak performance. Every athlete can confirm that a certain level of adrenalin is needed to bring their best performance to the table. And what triggers the production of adrenalin? FACTS coaching aims to maintain this optimal level of tension by pushing the client to their limits. And because high-achieving people often operate optimally in higher levels of tension than coachs, the tension has to be calibrated to the client, and not to the coach. The most successful professional athletes and their coaches often state “keeping the tension” as their major challenge for sustaining excellence. And if you don’t aim high enough, this tension is lost in advance. We’ve all heard of the bank employees who took down the whole bank. Nick Leeson is one of them. A former broker at Barings Bank, the United Kingdom's oldest investment bank, he earned Barings £10,000,000 in his first year as general manager of future markets, which translated into a £130,000 bonus for himself. Motivated by his bonuses, Leeson started investing in increasingly risky trades – which led to the demise of the entire bank. By the end of 1995, his investments totalled a loss of £827,000,000, and Barings had to declare bankruptcy. What went wrong? Leeson narrowly focused on his individual goals, which led to a lack of system awareness. Clients are particularly prone to focusing chiefly on their own performance – because coaches traditionally encourage them to do so. Leeson’s only motivation was to push his personal outcomes, thinking that this is what was expected of him. What he didn’t realize is that the risks he was taking were threatening not only his own fate, but that of the whole system. What could have saved Leeson and Barings? A FACTS-trained coach. It’s a FACTS coach’s job to raise a client’s awareness of the system as a whole. This should be done by repeatedly asking questions that question the wider implications of the clients actions – without offering an opinion and avoiding to take the moral high ground. The goal is intelligent growth – not moralizing. Nick Leeson was eventually captured and sentenced to six and a half years in prison. His actions remain a warning of how single individuals can ruin whole organizations. Keeping this in the big players’ minds without inhibiting their potential is a sensitive task – but FACTS coaching offers the tools for the challenge. The key message in this book: Traditional coaching’s therapeutic origins prevent it from yielding optimal results. Coaching needs to face up to the FACTS and offer honest Feedback, make sure its clients are held Accountable, set Courageous goals, find and maintain the perfect Tension and pay attention to the System as a whole.",

    "author": "Tim Brown",
    "summary": "Let’s borrow a time machine and travel back in time. What would you see? Horse-drawn coaches; no telephones; perhaps even hunter-gatherers looking for a square meal for the tribe. Our lives today are, of course, different. Innovations in technology and agriculture have made living in the modern world simpler and easier. One would think, therefore, that innovation equals progress. But is this true? These blinks show us that, although innovation is powerful, it hasn’t exactly made our lives better. What is needed to invent truly innovative products or services that make our lives truly better is a whole different type of thinking, called design thinking. In these blinks, you’ll discover how being “thoughtless” could lead to thoughtful innovation; why thinking with your hands beats thinking with your head; and how sharing stories can get people to be more charitable. Many people understand innovation to be simply the process of inventing a new technology. When you have your new invention, then you have an “innovation.“ This view is far too simplistic. In contrast, design thinking offers you a method to approach the process of innovation, and thus achieve a more sophisticated understanding of innovation itself. Design thinking encourages us to take an integrative approach to innovation. This approach combines three overlapping “spaces,” through which a project may cycle several times. First comes inspiration. In this space, we consider a problem or opportunity, thinking about what we can do to solve the problem or bring the opportunity to fruition. Second is ideation. Here we develop our ideas and theories, and then put them to the test. Last is implementation. In this space, we introduce our idea to the market. You won’t march directly through these three spaces – rather, most innovations will pass through each space a number of times as part of the design thinking process. For example, during the process of ideation, you could develop a product with features that go beyond addressing your initial problem. In this case, you might want to revisit the inspiration process, to consider what different kinds of problems your product’s new feature could solve. To create an integrated solution, a design thinker must balance three aspects: feasibility, viability and desirability. Whereas a “normal” designer may resolve the different aspects of a project separately and one by one, a design thinker brings them all together as one harmonious solution. The gaming console Nintendo Wii offers an example of an integrated solution that perfectly balances feasibility, viability and desirability. Nintendo introduced gestural control to console gaming, which at the time was not only feasible (if not cutting-edge) but viable. The company also priced the console less than other machines on the market, while providing a more immersive experience for the player – thus making the Wii desirable for their target market. In the course of your design projects, you too should make this integrative approach the foundation of your design thinking. According to economist Peter Drucker, a designer’s job is to convert need into demand. Simple enough, yet how exactly does a designer go about doing this? Design thinking supposes that the best insights come from observation, or taking a closer look at how people live their daily lives. Psychologist Jane Fulton Suri says that we are so good at adapting our behaviors to inconvenient situations that we’re often not aware of the “thoughtless acts” that could trigger inspiration for the observant designer. Imagine an office worker trying to sort out the tangled chaos of cables under his desk by sticking a label to each one. He likely wouldn’t have come up with this solution had he been asked directly how to solve this particular problem. This is why observing people’s real-life behavior is so important. Observing provides meaningful insights into pressing needs. Yet design thinking goes beyond mere observation, in that it also invites people to engage in creating solutions to their own problems. Psychologist Abraham Maslow suggests that once a person’s basic needs are met, he will look instead for meaningful or emotionally satisfying experiences. From a design perspective, a great customer experience is one that fulfills these higher-order needs. But since every person has different needs and aspirations, design thinking proposes that we let people participate in creating their own customer experience to make it personally meaningful and engaging to them. Whole Foods Market, for example, is one of the most successful retailers in the United States, as the store provides an enriching shopping experience by offering free samples of products and a wide variety of healthy products that cater to customers’ lifestyles. At a Whole Foods Market location in Austin, Texas, the company is even experimenting with letting customers cook inside the store! This sort of hands-on approach allows customers to engage and thus gives them the opportunity to create their own meaningful experience. Many of us played with LEGOs as children, building our own dreamworlds brick by colorful brick. As adults, however, we do most of our inventing in our heads long before we employ our hands to realize our ideas concretely. Yet thinking with our hands, or prototyping, is a powerful strategy for design thinkers as it can generate better results faster. By actually building an idea (with materials, rather than with only our minds), we quickly learn its limitations and see the many possible directions we can take it. Thus prototyping shouldn’t come at the end of the process but at the beginning! The earlier you start prototyping, the more rudimentary your prototypes will be. But consider that a ball from a roll-on deodorant and a plastic butter dish was all it took to prototype Apple’s first mouse! Once you have a prototype, you should put it out in the real world and observe how people use it. This way, you can quickly discern whether it “works” or how people actually would use it. When T-Mobile started social groups via mobile phones, for example, the company launched two prototypes simultaneously and observed how users interacted with each. Thus the company was able to get a deeper understanding of which solutions customers found more compelling. The reason prototyping is so powerful is because it occupies all three spaces of innovation at once. It is always inspirational, in that using and observing a prototype gives birth to new ideas and potential improvements. Playing with a prototype is a way to test and develop your idea. In other words, it fits solidly in the ideation space. And prototyping demonstrates the viability of an idea, showing that it can actually work and that it belongs in the marketplace, discoveries that live in the implementation space. Our love of storytelling starts at an early age, and stories are at least partly responsible for how we understand ideas and concepts. Thus it should be no surprise that storytelling too plays an important role in design thinking. Design thinkers use stories to make a product more relatable to customers. To develop a good story, a design thinker must consider how a product came into being and how a customer will use it over time. Importantly, the storyline must involve the customer at every step, reaching as far back as the very beginning of the product’s life. For outdoor wear company Icebreaker, this meant attaching a code to each of its garments, with which a customer could track, for example, the wool in a jacket to its source in New Zealand, even to the exact farm where the Merino sheep are cared for. The ways in which a customer uses a product over its lifespan should also be considered when developing a story. To sell a project that was essentially a predecessor of a modern GPS system, IDEO designers told a story about a sailor navigating from one port to the next. Each “chapter” in the story described another important problem the sailor encountered along his journey, and each solution was a feature that was to be developed for the system. But the most meaningful stories are those which customers can write themselves. By engaging customers as active participants in a product’s story, they will be more inclined to use the product or service. The American Red Cross used this to its advantage when it invited people to share stories and motivations for donating blood – a mother’s life was saved thanks to a blood transfusion, for example – thus reinforcing the goal of getting donors to return. These stories remind donors of the good that they do, and motivate new donors to contribute as well to this \"common commitment.\" Google has pink flamingos and inflatable dinosaurs. Pixar has beach huts. Start-ups all over the world have “chill-out” lounges and ping-pong tables. Such perks are the marks of creative company cultures. However, you don’t necessarily need a beach hut or a comfy sofa to create an environment that fosters innovation. Innovation happens when an organization supports experimentation and accepts failure as a part of life. When people are afraid to try new things, no breakthroughs will happen. People won’t dare to develop or test ideas for fear of the consequences of failure. New ideas require an environment where failure – and thus learning – is an acceptable step on the road to innovation. Innovation too requires the right kind of team. Specifically, collaboration in diverse, interdisciplinary smart teams helps to unlock an organization's creative powers. Any project requires input from as many people as possible, including designers, engineers, marketing managers and so on. Bringing all these people together at the beginning as part of your smart team allows you to capitalize on interdisciplinary thinking. Indeed, designers will offer different ideas, perspectives and insights than accountants or software engineers will, but their ideas are no less viable or relevant. It’s important to incorporate these ideas as soon as possible for the sake of expedience. Smart teams will need space to work, and companies should provide a designated space for doing so. The internet as well offers tons of possibilities for teams to work together and innovate. One such online platform is Innocentive, where any research & development team can post a challenge, to which thousands of scientists, designers and engineers can contribute solutions. In a physical office, however, companies should simply designate a physical space in which people from different departments can come together – away from their own private desks – to get the creative juices flowing. Much to the chagrin of parents, children always ask, “Why?” even about the simplest things. Discovering and trying to understand the world from their own developing perspective, children are always looking for insight that will help make sense of what they’re seeing and experiencing. Similarly, a good design thinker always asks, “Why?” Such questioning allows us the opportunity to reframe a problem, understand its constraints and use the information to find a more innovative solution. Instead of accepting the world “as it is” because “it has always been thus,” we should ask whether a current solution to a problem is the optimal one, or indeed whether we’re even addressing the right problem in the first place. Before organized agriculture, humans gathered fruits and vegetables from near and far. This exhausting, sometimes fruitless task was simply the way things were done for thousands of years. Eventually somebody asked: Why do we spend so much time wandering around for food when we know that plants grow from and also produce seeds? By asking this simple question and using it as a springboard for innovation, agriculture, and thus civilization, were born. But good design thinkers aren’t satisfied with just having discovered a solution to a problem. Rather, they want to share their ideas in the hopes that the ideas will be built upon by other innovators. It’s easy to get possessive about ideas. After all, we’ve put so much time and energy into them that we start to see them as parts of ourselves. Thus we try to monopolize the development of our ideas and bar others from tinkering with them. But this is terrible for innovation! If an idea is shared freely, it will quickly improve – and that’s a situation in which everybody wins. As the evidence for human-made global climate change continues to mount, companies and designers need to consider what they can do to help preserve a livable climate for all. Design thinking has the potential to increase public awareness and inspire everyone to engage in a more sustainable lifestyle by effectively informing people about environmental issues. This is not because people are intrinsically interested in environmental sustainability, however. Rather, companies need to find ways to inspire sustainable habits based on behaviors that people already exhibit or that are easily introduced. For example, after design thinkers realized that shoppers valued style and comfort over basic energy efficiency when it came to purchasing products, the U.S. Department of Energy decided to shift its focus when promoting products to encourage Americans to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Thus designers explored the creation of stylish yet nonetheless energy-efficient products and catchy informational tools to better attract consumers’ attention when shopping. Design thinkers also understand that to communicate the urgency of climate change, facts alone are not enough. Thus, designers need to start thinking about how to make sustainability more accessible. One practical way for design thinkers to find a solution is to use a deck of cards, called “Drivers of Change.” The deck is composed of cards with answers to questions like, “Can we afford a low-carbon future?” The cards get a message across with simple facts and images. In fact, the deck has been used by discussion groups to inspire developments in sustainability initiatives. Design thinkers should look at the entire production process, examining products from the extraction of raw materials to disposal. In doing so, it’s hard not to find opportunities for environmentally friendly innovation! A good example of this kind of design thinking is Pangea Organics, a company that produces natural body-care products. Its products employ compostable packaging that contains wildflower seeds; thus you can soak the packaging with water and toss it in your backyard, where it would grow! The key message in this book: Producing the kinds of innovations that change the world requires starting with the right design philosophy – one that emphasizes fluidity, brings people together and keeps its focus on the real-word applications and implications of an idea. Actionable advice: Make it a rule to ask “Why?” once a day.   By being intentional about second-guessing everything, from “Why is the sky blue?” to the foundational beliefs that inform your life’s perspective, you can learn to become more flexible in your problem solving and might even find some inspiration for products and services along the way. Suggested further reading: The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman This book explores the cognitive psychology of good design and what makes a product that responds to users’ needs. The author develops the common barriers to good design, how to reduce and fix errors, and how to bring users and technology closer together.",

    "title": "Change the Culture, Change the Game",
    "author": "Roger Connors and Tom Smith",
    "summary": "Too many leaders and management consultants try to take short cuts when tasked with shaking up the culture of an organization. Just by stating, “We want a higher profit margin,” they think that employees will jump to action and align their work with this broad and poorly conceived goal. It just doesn’t work that way! These blinks show you that to change a culture, you have to integrate that change from the very top of your organization to the very bottom. And focusing on results and goals is just one small part of the puzzle. You have to consider all the elements on the table – company experience, employee beliefs and ingrained practices – and then ensure that what you change is actually sustained. Yet in doing so, you’ll find that your organization will hum along like a well-oiled machine, and processes that were previously bogged down now run with precision and ease. In the following blinks, you’ll discover how General Motors overhauled its corporate culture and stemmed massive losses; why changing a culture is a transition and not a transformation; and why one bookstore lets employees give tokens to each other. Managers shape a company’s culture every day in the experiences they create for employees. Employees in turn learn how things are done, and an organizational culture establishes itself. Yet not all organizational cultures are healthy. In some cases, they can even do more damage than good. This is why leaders need to focus on creating a culture that is beneficial for the company as a whole, from the lowest levels all the way to the top. But how is this done? The first step is to define your goals and a strategy to reach them. For example, “Make decisions. Take risks. Move fast. Be accountable,” was the strategy General Motors put forward in 2009 to change its culture and stop the company from losing money once and for all. How did GM decide on this route? To shape your culture and help your organization win, you have to understand the results pyramid. There are three key components that make up the results pyramid: experiences, beliefs and actions. Stacked on top of each other, the components all contribute to the end result, or the achievements of your organization. In short: experiences promote beliefs, beliefs impact actions and actions generate results. Alaris Medical Systems had a bad rep on Wall Street and was criticized for its inability to execute on otherwise quite good ideas. This was the case, that is, until the company turned to the results pyramid as a guide to change its culture. Alaris executives discussed with every manager how to create the right experiences to foster the desired beliefs, which would in turn produce effective actions, and ultimately achieve the company’s desired target results. Once the program was introduced, every employee at every level was motivated, optimistic and determined to get results and execute. Within six months, Alaris had completely turned their reputation around! So what kind of culture exactly should you be thinking about implementing within your organization? The key is in the last line of General Motor’s reformed strategy: “Be accountable.” Accountability is vital to a strong organizational culture, and it is shaped by every action an employee performs. In organizations, a thin line separates great companies from poor ones. In general, there are two modes of acting: above the line and below the line. Only one promotes accountability. By acting above the line, we can move toward accountability in four simple steps. First, we have to see it, by considering other people’s viewpoints, communicating honestly and candidly, exchanging feedback and hearing the difficult truths that expose the real circumstances at hand. Second, we need to own it by accepting the goals and priorities of the organization’s mission as one’s own. Only then are we able to solve it, by asking what else we could do to get the results we want. Finally, we’ve got to do it, and perform the tasks we said we would, focus on our priorities and be reliable and trustworthy.   When everyone in an organization decides of their own free will to take above the line steps, you’ll have a culture of accountability. While your company should strive for above the line actions, below the line actions will only harm your organizational culture. When we act below the line, we refuse to accept responsibility and instead become obsessed with blame games, cycles of finger pointing and employees playing the victim. Of course, acting below the line is also human. But by remaining below the line, you’ll tread in dangerous waters regarding accountability. Accountability shouldn’t make the question, “Who’s accountable for this?” sound like a punishment. It should instead be empowering. Accountability isn’t about “getting caught” or failing, but should be approached as playing a starring role in reaching a solution. In a world where being first means everything, you can’t take your time implementing a culture change. But equally importantly, you can’t take shortcuts, either! Too often, leaders try to change the way people act to get the results they want without working to change the way people think or what they believe. So while employees might appear involved, they won’t actually be committed to the company’s cause. This means that only the top of the results pyramid is being addressed – actions and results – while the pyramid’s two fundamental elements – experiences and beliefs – are being neglected.   To better understand why this doesn’t work, let’s call R1 your current results, as produced by the current culture, C1. Then let’s call R2 the desired results that you’ll get with C2, the new culture. It’s impossible to get results with your current culture, C1. So to create C2, you have to create new experiences, E2, and new beliefs, B2. Only these can effectively shape new actions, A2, to generate improved results, R2, as your new culture, C2, emerges.    Creating a shift in experiences and beliefs takes more effort. But it will yield substantial, long-lasting changes that will then create a firm foundation for the results you want. This process occurs on different scales and at different speeds for different companies. Think of assuming a new approach to your organization’s culture as a transition and not as a transformation. An optical retailer wanted to test a new organizational culture, and so the company ran a pilot in a few retail stores. After two months, business improved more than 5 percent. The change in culture had led to the desired R2; results, as employees were thinking and acting differently with regard to daily work. Soon thereafter, the retailer took the change company-wide. How can you get everyone in your organization to rally around those key R2 results? Simply: alignment. Think of alignment as the guiding beliefs and deliberate actions that an organization applies to a clear and common goal. When people are all on the same page, following the same goals, there’s less stress, decision making is faster and more efficient, and other processes across the organization also speed up. In this way, alignment is vital for effective cultural change. Still not clear on why this is the case? Think about what happens when you have confusion about your goals. This can kill the momentum in your push for change. Why? Because nobody’s aligned. They don’t know where to push, or in which direction to go. For instance, fast-food chain Fast Grill wanted to improve its profit margins so the company could expand. During a meeting, the author asked Fast Grill’s top management what key results the company was aiming for. They all replied “profit margins.” Seems aligned, right? But when the author followed up and asked what the exact margin goal was, everyone in management gave different answers! Fast Grill management’s confusion led to poor execution, below the line behavior, and thus slow change. To avoid this situation, ensure that everyone’s on the same page and totally aligned! Remember: alignment is a process, not an event. It is something you must constantly work to achieve. If you want to guide a culture change in your organization, there are certain skills you’ll need as a leader. Having such skills are key to accelerating the process and enhancing your overall leadership. So what are these skills? The first thing you’ll need to take your organization from C1 to C2 is the skill to lead the change. In other words, you can’t just assign the responsibility to another department. As a leader, it’s up to you to keep abreast with everything going on as part of the change at every level. When you’re leading a change on such a major scale, you’ll no doubt receive criticism. To deal with this, you’ll need the skill to respond back. There are five steps you should take in response to feedback, to ensure everyone is aligned toward C2. First, you must identify the beliefs you want others to share. Second, you need to communicate this belief; and third, you should portray the experience you’re going to deliver to your employees. Fourth, you need to ask for feedback on the planned experience, and finally, enroll employees in providing feedback as the plan progresses. The final necessary skill to lead a change is the skill to be facilitative. You want meaningful dialogue about the culture change in your organization? Then you’ve got to encourage dialogue, teamwork and collaboration. Sony VAIO wanted to improve repair-related customer satisfaction scores by 15 percent over the previous year. Steven Nickel, VAIO Service vice president, energized the organization around R2 by opening the door to an ongoing dialogue. Many team members who had never spoken up in meetings before enthusiastically shared numerous improvement ideas, and VAIO Service ultimately exceeded its goal. Making all these plans and implementing a change means nothing if you can’t sustain it! There are three simple steps to ensure you integrate C² practices into the everyday life of your organization. First, list all the meetings, policies and procedures that the organization has. Second, find where you can integrate a culture change into your organizational systems. And finally, apply the changes into the activities you’ve selected. Eastside Health Plans offers an example of this three-step process. After the Eastside management team evaluated the first two steps in the integration process, they arrived at a plan. The team took early steps to align their organizational systems as well, from administration to meetings to human resources. For the first time in 25 years, leaders began to create significant experiences that suggested the company would not tolerate waste. Teams were formed to address waste as well as inefficiencies and administrative costs within the organization. These teams ultimately achieved line-item cost savings of over $200 million! If you can integrate a culture change effectively, your employees won’t see it as just another annoying management program. Instead, it will become an enjoyable part of life at work. For example, one of the author’s daughters took a job at a local bookstore and shared with him how much she enjoyed the culture at her new job. When asked what she enjoyed the most, she explained that whenever an employee saw another employee doing a good job, they could give that employee a token, to earn free products from the store. In fact, the store was one of the father’s clients, and one that had integrated a culture of accountability into their organization so successfully that the culture became a positive aspect of an employee’s day! The key message in this book: Take your organization to its full potential by implementing a culture change and fostering accountability across all levels. By considering relationships between experiences, beliefs, actions and results, steps can be taken toward building and then sustaining a new organizational culture. Actionable advice: Take it step by step! To help ensure accurate alignment around key decisions with everyone in an organization, the leadership alignment process is a useful guide. Step one is participation, where you get the appropriate people involved. Step two is accountability, where you identify those who will make decisions. Step three is discussion, in which you make sure that people are able to speak up and are heard. Step four is ownership, where you promote the decision as your own. Step five involves communication, to ensure that your message is consistent. And finally, step 6 is follow-up, where you check in with your organization and test for appropriate alignment across all areas. Suggested further reading: How to Be a Positive Leader by Jane E.

    "title": "Chief Joy Officer",
    "author": "Richard Sheridan",
    "summary": "Too many of us wake up in the morning and look ahead to our workday with a sense of dread. When the author, Richard Sheridan, was a manager at a software company, Interface Systems, he dreaded work so much he changed his route to the office. Turning off the highway, he’d drive backroads and head into the countryside before reluctantly arriving at work. He soon realized there simply had to be a better approach to work and leadership. Sheridan came to dream of leading an organization in which people could find real joy. At Menlo Innovations, the software firm that the author founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he’s achieved his dream. These blinks recount how he leads his business with a focus on joy and optimism. Sheridan describes how it’s possible to cultivate leadership that ignores fear, hierarchy and bureaucracy, and cares instead about creativity and personal authenticity. In these blinks, you’ll understand how, with the right values, approaches and systems, it’s possible for anyone to do the same. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the author’s ten-year-old self taught him about business; why humility is a key leadership quality; and why interview candidates should be encouraged to care for one another. Do you show your authentic self in the workplace? Or are office-you and home-you different people? Too many people feel unable to be their authentic selves in the workplace. A local non-profit organization called Ele’s Place once visited Menlo, the author’s company, to share its story. Ele’s Place helps young people process grief after the loss of a family member. One of the exercises they run uses a white plastic mask, the kind you might see at a costume party. The teenagers are encouraged to write, on the outside of the mask, what emotions they shared with the world. Things like ‘I’m feeling better,’ or, ‘I’m hanging in there.’ But on the inside of the masks, the children would write how they really felt with sentences like ‘when will the hurt stop?’ or simply, ‘scared.’ When they shared their masks, they realized – often for the first time – that other people experienced the same feelings. The exercise allowed them to be authentic in a safe environment, and therefore to process their overwhelming emotions. Sharing our true emotional state – the inside of our masks – in the workplace is hard, particularly for leaders who feel they should – like the hurting teenagers – put on a brave face and hide their vulnerabilities. Read the outside of a leader’s mask, and it might say words like ‘confident,’ ‘ambitious’ or ‘strong.’ But inside? Words like ‘stressed,’ ‘anxious’ and ‘overwhelmed’ might show up. And just like with the teenagers, perhaps they might take comfort in sharing their masks with their colleagues and fellow leaders. It may be counterintuitive to embrace the vulnerabilities that come with true authenticity. The next important leadership value, humility, may also appear to go against good business practice. If your business is humble, won’t your more confident competitors trample all over you? Well, for the author, humility is all about considering others and acknowledging that all work in a business is noble. That’s why the author often cleans up after client lunches. It’s why every morning, he empties the office dishwasher. If keeping things tidy is a behavior he wants to instill in his organization, he should be willing to follow through on that himself. As a result, he has a happy team, content in the knowledge that he’s humble enough to do anything that he might ask of them. What color hat do you wear? The psychologist and philosopher Edward de Bono wrote a book, first published in 1985, called Six Thinking Hats, in which he set out six different approaches to thinking through any situation. The white hat-wearing thinker, for example, sees any situation solely through a prism of cold hard facts. Someone wearing a red hat, by contrast, would consider only the emotion of the moment. The black hat is often regarded as the engineering mindset, considering all that could go wrong, how and why. We need this kind of thinking. Without it, buildings in earthquake zones would topple. But leaders can’t afford to get bogged down with this thinking alone. They need to put their yellow hats on, too. The yellow hat is an optimistic outlook that is oriented toward success, considering from the start that success is a strong possibility. When an organization has plenty of people looking at things from the perspective of a white, red or black hat, sometimes it needs its leader to be wearing a yellow hat, so that they can provide optimism and engagement. In practical terms, that can involve just saying, “That seems like a great idea. Let’s do it.” Leaders from all over the world, from brands like GM, GE, Coca-Cola and McKinsey have visited the author’s company to learn how it built such a joyful culture, with minimal hierarchy and a highly engaged team. They’re usually inspired and ask what they could do as a leader that would make a difference. The author always says “abandon your office and move onto the floor with your people.” This advice is often met with nervous laughter, and the advice is rarely followed. But one visitor, Ron Sail, then-leader of GE Global Services in New York, did just that. He gave up his own office, tore down the rest of the walls dividing his team, and embraced face-to-face conversations and team spirit. The result? His team loved him. Others at GE now want to emulate his way of working. GE even named a training center after him. By tearing down walls, Ron had embraced the optimism and joy that said, “why not just try it?” So embrace optimism. If you have an idea for something that might make your organization more joyful, don’t get stuck in black-hat thinking and examine every way it might go wrong. Just do it. In 1968, the author’s mom ordered a new bookshelf. At that time, getting new furniture was a big deal, and his mom was excited. The author decided he would surprise his parents while they were out. So, at just ten years old, he carefully assembled the bookcase himself, arranged some books, hooked up their stereo and had his mom’s favorite record playing when they walked in. His dad looked on, speechless, and his mom actually cried. It was a joyful moment to see their reactions. This moment taught him a lesson that has influenced his business career – that true joy comes not from creating things for ourselves, but from serving others. So, try to build a culture focused on serving people. There’s an old story about three bricklayers, which shows how this instills joy. A passerby asked the three men what they were doing. The first replied that he was laying bricks. The second one said that he was building a wall. The third? With a wide, proud smile, he said that he was creating a cathedral. The third man was joyful because he felt that his work was serving others. This goes to show it’s possible to focus on serving others, whatever your business or your role. That’s even the case if you’re doing something as simple as cleaning tables. The author used to indulge in a McDonald’s meal when he would fly out of the Detroit airport. He always noticed an older McDonald’s worker, Mike. His job was to clean away trash and wipe tables – mundane but important tasks he did with great care. But he didn’t just keep things clean. He served. If he saw that you didn’t have a napkin, he’d offer to get you one. Then he’d make small talk, and wish you a pleasant flight – small touches, perhaps, but a remarkable attitude nonetheless. Once, the author noticed that a younger man had taken Mike’s place. And, to the author’s surprise, this man also went out of his way to offer assistance and a kind word. When the author tracked down the branch manager, the manager said that it was no coincidence. He felt a little kindness and care went a long way in a competitive retail environment, so he’d established a culture built around service. The branch manager wasn’t just a manager. By building an effective culture, he showed that he was a leader. Let’s take a look at that crucial difference in more detail. What’s the difference between a leader and a boss? Well, a boss tells you what to do using the authority of their position. A leader influences and motivates. A boss demands adherence, whereas a leader cultivates thinking, teamwork and a lets-get-things-done-together attitude. While a boss tends to be at the top of a hierarchy, leaders can be found at every level. There are plenty of reasons why an organization that cultivates leaders, rather than bosses, will be more effective. One is that an organization with a leadership culture will be more likely to experiment. In a boss-oriented workplace, if you want to try something new and exciting, you have to get the boss’ permission. That’s problematic, because if permission is regularly sought but denied, then at some point people will stop seeking it, and innovations will die before they’re proposed. But in a leadership-oriented organization, there’s little requirement for formal permission, and no blame culture when ideas are tried but go wrong. In the author’s previous role at Interface Systems, he hung a poster on the wall that said “Make Mistakes Faster.” At first, still thinking like a boss, he wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. He didn’t really want more, faster mistakes – he wanted the opposite. But eventually, he came to realize that trying to avoid small mistakes was actually slowing things down and contributing to large, costly errors. In a leader-oriented culture, mistakes are expected and dealt with by teams happy to roll up their sleeves and work together to correct them or learn from them. Prioritizing leaders over bosses means having a non-hierarchical culture. At Menlo Innovations, the whole team is empowered to make decisions, rather than deferring to and seeking permission from just one or two bosses. At Menlo, for example, interviews are conducted by the whole team, as are performance reviews and other key decisions. It’s such a radically non-hierarchical organization that when a guest asked Menlo team members who they reported to, they were stumped. One said, unsure, “I guess the customers?” Another ventured that they reported to the process itself. Then, almost in unison, they all pointed to each other. “We report to each other,” they said. Menlo is living proof that an organization without bosses can work. But to get it right, you need strong systems. When you think about what brings you joy, systems probably don’t immediately spring to mind. If you want to make your organization joyful, though, focusing on systems is actually a great step to take. Unfortunately, systems are often overlooked when businesses are faced with challenges like a failed sales pitch or a harsh customer complaint. These are often put down to chance or lack of work ethic. A good leader, however, will consider that it might be the result of a flawed system. System thinkers approach an organization in terms of its systems and processes. They consider the way work is allocated and monitored, or how certain tasks can be made simpler. Systems thinkers are always looking for ways to make things better. Take Menlo’s time tracking system, for example. Every week, everyone in the business submits a timesheet detailing the time they worked on each task, accurate to every fifteen minutes. This simple system enables them to make reliable predictions about the time needed for future projects. This reduces the need for excessive overtime, which in turn reduces bugs in software and the anxiety and low morale that come from being overworked. So, systems are important. But how do you design them in a way that brings joy? Well, one key factor is to create policies that reward the positive behaviors that you want to encourage. The author once advised Dominique Coster, an R&D team leader for an automotive supplier, on how to generate the kind of team collaboration that Menlo enjoys. Coster had taken the author’s advice, by opening up the office space to facilitate more spontaneous conversation. As a result, team collaboration improved. But after a few months, things had stalled. The author stumbled upon a solution when he asked Coster what they celebrated as a team. The answer was that each time a patent was issued, the individual who had been granted the patent received a plaque, often presented by senior management flown in from Tokyo. Bingo! The author pointed out that while Coster wanted to cultivate team thinking, he was celebrating individual achievement. Soon after, Coster’s team started rewarding the whole team behind the patents, from engineers to accountants. They changed their system, and behavior in the organization changed as a result. Do the people in your organization truly care about one another? If not, have you considered how much more joyful your workplace would be if they did? To build an ethos of caring for one another, consider the systems you have in place relating to your people. Recruitment would be a great place to start. Potential recruits at Menlo are given a clear message about the company's ethos from the beginning. In their first interview, candidates work in pairs to complete a joint task. They’re also given clear instructions – they might be competing, but they must help one another in order to get a second interview. If one partner is struggling, the other should help them out. If one seems nervous, the second should try to put them at ease. Employees learn from their very first encounter with Menlo that it’s an organization in which colleagues look out for one another’s interests rather than their own. They quickly learn to embrace the shared responsibility of supporting one another. For example, one Menlo employee was struggling with punctuality, and occasionally not making it to the office at all due to problems at home. In many businesses, the situation may have resulted in a firing. At Menlo, though, another colleague volunteered to pick the employee up every morning and bring him to the office. This gave the troubled employee the extra push he needed to make it to work, probably saving him his job. On other occasions, caring for others simply means thinking about each other as people, not just as employees. The author’s assistant, Anna, coordinates his life and helps arrange his busy schedule of international speaking engagements, as well as tours and visits to Menlo’s offices. In 2015, the author gave over 40 talks around the world. He enjoyed the work, but it was a bit too much for him. Before he even had to say anything, Anna told the author she was refusing any requests for December that would involve travel. Having some family time, she said, was more important for him. Caring is important. But so is sharing – specifically, sharing knowledge and experience. Your business may be under threat, and you don’t even know it. Borders Books was founded in 1971. Hugely successful, in its last year of operation it employed almost 20,000 people. Amazon was only founded in 1994, but by 2011 it had put Borders out of business. Borders had 17 years to learn how to survive in a new, internet-dominated world. But it couldn’t. If there’s one lesson to learn from this, it’s that leaders need to be active, continual learners. As Peter Senge, a systems scientist at MIT, says, the only long-term source of competitive advantage is a business’ ability to learn more quickly than its competition. So, how can you build a learning culture? First, try to establish strong reading habits within your team to generate excitement and imagination about new ideas. The author’s co-founder, James Goebel, sometimes comments that Menlo never invented anything. They stole every idea they ever had from a book. There are a couple of practical things you can do to build a reading culture. The first is simply to make books available. Create a free library. Don’t worry if books go missing. If a particular favorite is always unavailable, buy a second copy. You can then go one step further and start an in-house book club, or a “lunch and learn” session, where one team member shares insights from a book they’ve read. Not only is this a great way to spread new ideas, but it can also help build presentation skills. The second is to let your people teach each other. The most important thing that Menlo has done to enable a learning culture is pairing its people together. Almost all colleagues, from programmers to project managers, work in pairs. Programmers work with other programmers, and project managers work with other project managers. They sit together and work through each task. And because pairs change every week, colleagues are constantly learning. They learn from one another’s experiences, strengths and even weaknesses. When someone has an idea, they must lead their paired colleague toward it, thinking out loud, articulating their vision and answering questions. This makes continuous learning part of the process. And that doesn’t just make your business more resilient and prepared for the future. It creates a business in which people are constantly enjoying learning and teaching, exchanging views and expanding their horizons – a business that brings joy. The key message in these blinks: Too many people face their workday with a sense of dread. But it doesn’t have to be this way. If you’re a leader, there are some simple things you can do to build a culture that generates joy. You can abandon the old ways of doing things that rely on hierarchy, bureaucracy and fear, and embrace a model in which people have a sense of purpose, can take responsibility, learn from one another and constantly improve. You can create joy at work. Actionable advice: Give equal bonuses. One of the most important things you can do to build a joyful culture is to give equal bonuses – not as a percentage of pay, but equal amounts. That tells everyone that each person contributes something valuable to the business, from the smartest engineer to the assistant who answers the phone so pleasantly when a potential client calls. Nobody quite knows what moments of magic or mundane coincidence lead to success, so focus on rewarding the accomplishments of the team. Got feedback?

    "title": "15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management",
    "author": "Kevin Kruse",
    "summary": "Modern life is full of time thieves. Whether it’s your phone buzzing in your pocket with the latest tweet, a colleague interrupting you in the middle of an important task or the daily barrage of emails, your time is constantly being stolen from you, minute by minute, hour by hour. And once you’ve lost that time, you can never get it back again. To remain focused and make sure these time thieves don’t get the upper hand, you need to keep a few tricks up your sleeve. These blinks will get you started. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the number 1,440 is so important; about the 321-Zero system; and how many books George W. Bush read throughout his presidency.   Do you ever wish you could have an extra hour in the day to read, exercise or hang out with the people you love? Well, you can and there’s no magic required! But first, you need to understand how precious time is. That’s why the first secret of time management is learning that time is your most valuable asset and that, once it’s lost, you can never get it back. A good way to monitor this precious resource is by breaking it down. For instance, there are 1,440 minutes in a day, each of which should be invested wisely. To remind himself of this fact, the author taped a “1,440” poster to his office door. It reminds him of the limited time in each day. But why use minutes? Why not think about the 86,400 seconds that every day offers? Well, there are a bunch of daily tasks that you can actually do in a minute, like knocking out 30 sit-ups, reading a poem or watering a plant. This fact makes minutes key to monitoring your time. Okay, now that you appreciate how valuable time is, it’s time to start prioritizing it. This is where the second secret comes in: determine and prioritize your most important task, or your MIT. This is the single task that will have the biggest impact on your life or work. Just take Therese Macan, a professor at the University of Missouri-St Louis. She found that one of the most important productivity determinants is the ability to identify priorities. So pinpointing an MIT is central to time management. For instance, if a senior executive sets a goal of developing a new app, her MIT might be to hire a new programmer. Or the MIT for a start-up CEO could be to prepare a great presentation to land a major investment. Research has shown that having a daily MIT, whatever it is, results in greater levels of happiness and improved focus. Lots of people are weighed down by never-ending to-do lists. Take a look at yours. How many of the tasks have been lingering there for weeks, unnecessarily stressing you out? You probably have at least a few such tasks, and the best way to deal with them is by pulling out a good old fashioned calendar. Here’s where the third secret comes into play: ditch your to-do list and pick up your calendar to de-stress your day. Research has found that an average of 41 percent of items on to-do lists never actually get completed. One of the reasons for this shocking statistic is that the tasks on such lists usually aren’t accompanied by a note stating how long it’ll take to complete them. As a result, tasks that are more difficult or less important generally get left undone. That might not be such a problem, except for the fact that the unfinished items on your to-do list will inevitably produce a lot of stress that could just as easily be avoided. In fact, researchers from Florida State University discovered that you can avoid this stress by simply coming up with a plan to complete a task. The Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller offers a good example. She succeeded at spending time with her family, completing her school obligations, training for the Olympics and even doing media interviews, all by scheduling time for important tasks. This strategy is known as time blocking or time boxing and, incredibly, all it requires is maintaining a detailed calendar. By doing so, Miller forced herself to prioritize tasks that would bring her closer to achieving her goal and, to this day, she keeps an almost minute-by-minute schedule. However, you’ll inevitably encounter tasks on your calendar that you can’t accomplish. When this happens, instead of letting them drift into the past, simply reschedule. For example, if you usually make it to the gym at noon, but have a flight to catch at the same time, simply move your workout to earlier in the day. Everyone’s been there: an important deadline is creeping up and, instead of working on the project at hand, you’re planted in front of a screen – scrolling through Facebook, texting a friend or watching your favorite TV show. Procrastination is a tough one, but, luckily, there are strategies to break free from it and start getting things done. This is where the fourth secret comes in: procrastination can be overcome by imagining your future self. After all, you don’t procrastinate because you're lazy, but because you don’t have sufficient motivation. Imagining yourself in the future can fix this problem and it’s as simple as asking yourself two questions: “What pleasure will I get by doing this thing?” and “What pain will I feel if I don’t do it?” For instance, if your goal is to work out every single day, but you can’t get yourself to exercise, just imagine having a huge beer belly and feeling totally sluggish. Such a mental routine will get you off the couch and onto the treadmill. At the same time, being honest about the actions your future self will take can also help you achieve your goals. For example, if you know you’ll be inclined to eat unhealthy snacks during a future break, you can protect yourself by throwing out all the junk food in your house. You could even go a step further by filling the house with healthy options like baby carrots and hummus. From there, you can move on to the fifth secret: there will always be more to do; you can’t do everything. And, actually, that’s fine! In fact, prioritizing and scheduling the tasks you want to do is much more valuable than crossing off as many items as possible. Just take President George W. Bush as an example. He knew there would always be more to do. So instead of trying to do everything, he made it his priority to read tons of books, since he found it therapeutic and educational. As a result, he read some 95 titles during his presidency! Have you ever had an incredible idea while shopping for groceries or walking the dog? Wouldn’t it be great if, instead of straining to remember it later, you could just jot it down right then and there? That’s why the sixth secret is to always have a notebook handy. After all, writing down your thoughts helps you hold onto them. Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson says he never would have built his business empire without his trusty notebook. He was so committed to writing down his ideas that, one time when he had a business idea and no notebook, he wrote down the thought in his passport! For him, if an idea doesn’t get written down, it could be lost forever. Taking notes by hand also helps your memory. For instance, the psychologists Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer found that students who hand wrote their notes during a TED talk were better able to recall the material than students who took notes on their laptops. Writing down your thoughts is crucial – as is maintaining control over your schedule, which is where the seventh secret comes into play. It says that you should avoid checking your email too often, lest other people dictate how you spend your time. In fact, contrary to popular belief, constantly checking emails is unproductive. That’s because the anticipation felt when checking your inbox is comparable to pulling the handle of a slot machine. Often, you check your messages, and there’s nothing new. But sometimes there is a new message. This unpredictability is addictive, and one begins to check more and more often, hoping for the hit of dopamine that a message affords. Obviously, this costs you time and interrupts your focus. A good way to untether yourself from your email is by unsubscribing from newsletters by using a program like unroll.me. But you can also adopt the 321-Zero system. To do so, just limit yourself to three email checks per day, while trying to get your inbox to zero in just 21 minutes. If you’ve ever had an office job, you know how incredibly boring meetings can be. But that’s not the only problem with meetings. The eighth secret is that most meetings are inefficient and you should only schedule them as a last resort. In fact, a 2015 survey found that 35 percent of respondents considered weekly status meetings to be a waste of time, for these two primary reasons: First, in accordance with Parkinson’s law of triviality, meeting participants tend to waste lots of time on insignificant issues. Second, extroverts usually dominate meetings, making others less likely to participate. As a result, valuable information might not be shared during such gatherings. That being said, if you absolutely have to have a meeting, opt for a stand-up affair rather than a sit-down one. This might seem odd, but researchers at Washington University found that meetings during which participants stand result in better collaboration, less attachment to ideas, higher levels of engagement and more effective problem-solving. The Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, offers another good tip: by scheduling meetings based on increments of five or ten minutes, she’s able to have up to 70 meetings a week. If she stuck with the standard 30-minute block she would never be able to accomplish this. In other words, controlling the timing of meetings will prevent people from sucking up your time. This is key since other people will constantly ask you for things, a fact that dovetails nicely with the ninth secret: achieve your immediate goals faster by saying no to most things. After all, every time you say yes to something, you’re saying no to something else. The Olympic rower Sara Hendershot is a good example. She’s a pro at saying no to social and other engagements. This hard-learned skill enabled her to keep her eyes on the prize in the lead up to the 2012 Olympics in London, where she qualified for the finals. As a cherry on top, research has even found that people who tend to say no in response to requests for their time are happier and have more energy.  By now you know that it’s essential to spend your limited time on tasks that will have the greatest impact. The tenth secret can help you do that. It says that by applying the Pareto Principle you can uncover shortcuts to success. Here’s what that means: In the 1890s, the Italian philosopher and economist Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto found that 20 percent of the pea plants in his garden produced 80 percent of his healthy peapods. He extrapolated this 80/20 rule into the general principle that now bears his name. It can be applied to a number of areas. For instance, by applying the 80/20 rule to your employees, you might decide that the majority of your salespeople should be let go since they’re your lowest performers. From there, you could focus your energy on the remaining 20 percent, who already generate 80 percent of your sales, by giving them rewards and greater levels of support. The end result will likely be an overall improvement in sales. Or you could use the 80/20 rule in your personal life by analyzing the tasks you do on a weekly basis, then identifying which of them has the greatest impact. That being said, you can also accomplish more by critically assessing the tasks in front of you. The eleventh secret is designed to help you do that. It says that leveraging your skills and delegating work will increase your productivity. Just take a 2013 experiment published in the Harvard Business Review by the professors Julian Birkinshaw and Jordan Cohen. It found that 43 percent of workers were unsatisfied with the tasks they do at work. By simply training employees to slow down and ask themselves a few questions, the study’s authors were able to identify important tasks, freeing up an extra eight hours per week. The first question they had people ask themselves was, “How important is this task to the company?” Then, “Is there anyone else who can complete it?” And finally, “How could this task be accomplished if I had half as much time?” On a normal day in the office, do you ever have difficulty focusing? Most people do and a little bit of advice here can go a long way. This is the twelfth secret, which says that grouping your work into recurring themes each week will make you more effective. A great example comes from Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square. He says that the secret to running both his companies was to have a theme for each day. For instance, on Mondays, he would focus on management; Wednesdays would be dedicated to marketing; and Sunday would be reserved for reflection, feedback and strategy for the next week. Or take the entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan. He recommends theming each week based on three types of days to stay focused and remain invigorated. The first type is called a focus day, which is for vital activities like revenue-growing tasks. The second type is called a buffer day, which is for catching up on emails, returning calls, having meetings, delegating tasks and doing paperwork. And finally, a free day is one on which no work should be done. This last type is reserved for vacation, family time and charity work. Another simple way to boost your efficiency has to do with tackling small tasks. This is the thirteenth secret, which says that you should immediately take action on tasks that’ll take fewer than five minutes to accomplish and avoid returning to the same task over and over. Just consider the straight-A student Nihar Suthar. He completes five-minute assignments right away, avoiding a long list of tiny tasks. Or take the author. His sister Debbie recently emailed him, but instead of writing her back, he called her to make sure they could talk. By scheduling a call in his calendar and thereby saving the mental energy he would otherwise spend trying to remember to get back to her, he decided to handle this task immediately. If he had instead put it on a to-do list or left it in his inbox, he probably would have never remembered to address it. Imagine waking up at six in the morning, working out for 45 minutes and then whipping together a delicious, high-protein breakfast. It might sound difficult but the fourteenth secret shows why it’s essential. It says that dedicating the first hour of each day to a morning routine will enhance your health – mind, body and soul. In fact, starting the day with a workout is a great way to get your creative juices flowing. Just consider the New York Times best-selling author Dan Miller, who starts off each day by meditating for half an hour, then working out for 45 minutes while listening to audio programs. He avoids checking the news or looking at his phone during this time, devoting his first hour to positive and inspirational experiences. He even claims that his most creative ideas come to him during this daily “me time.” From there, you can further increase your energy and well-being by eating a healthy breakfast and drinking lots of water. This is huge for the best-selling author and podcast host Shawn Stevenson. He considers energy to be everything, and so he starts off each day with what he calls an inner bath. He simply drinks 30 ounces of purified water to jumpstart his metabolism by flushing out waste. In fact, according to the fifteenth secret, energy is paramount. The secret is that productivity isn’t about time, but about maintaining focus and energy. That’s why Francesco Cirillo came up with the Pomodoro Technique – a method designed to reduce distractions and boost productivity. His approach involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, devoting your full attention to a single task for the full 25 minutes and then taking a five-minute break before repeating the cycle. Author Monica Leonelle found ample success with the Pomodoro Technique after realizing that she didn’t have a single spare hour in the day. By using the Pomodoro Technique, she recharged during her breaks, maintaining steady energy throughout the day and, with the help of other techniques, went from writing 600 words per hour to 3,500! The key message in this book: Highly successful people consider time to be their most valuable asset. By applying their most effective life hacks – which do everything from prioritizing tasks to boosting your energy and keeping you focused – you too can make the most of your time. Actionable advice: Design a morning routine! When forming your morning routine, use the LIFE S.A.V.E.R.S system developed by the success coach Hal Elrod. This acronym will help you include the most important things. S stands for Silence to foster gratitude and meditation A is for Affirmations of goals and priorities V is for Visualizations of your ideal lifeE is for Exercise R is for Reading And the final S is for Scribing in your journal.

    "title": "Anything You Want",
    "author": "Derek Sivers",
    "summary": "Stay true to yourself, but be flexible! Make a business plan that makes investors believe in you but keep it simple! Delegate, but don’t delegate too much! Maybe you’ve already struggled with balancing some or all of these seemingly unbalanceable things when starting your own business. Maybe you’re feeling pretty lost. And could use some advice? In Anything You Want, that’s exactly what author Derek Sivers will give you. Based on his own personal success story and aiming to unravel the tangled threads of starting a business, he helps you figure out the answer to the question: How do you make your business anything you want? In these blinks, you’ll discover why you don’t really need that much money to start your own business; when delegation is good – or when it’s too much; and why the author refused to work with some musicians. When the author set out in the world of business he never intended to found CD Baby, an online independent music store. In fact, he’d previously attempted several other businesses only to end up unsuccessful. So, what made this one work? A key step was realizing that the more you improve your ideas, the higher the chances are that you’ll come up with one that’s truly successful. The point is that if you’ve been promoting your “perfect” idea for years and it’s still going nowhere, it might be time for a change. That means, if you’re not getting positive feedback – and a lot of it – it’s probably best to let go of your idea. Instead, you should try out new options and work to improve your ideas. Because if you’re always improving, you’re bound to hit on an idea that people will love. For instance, the author was totally surprised when one of his ideas suddenly caught fire among his musician friends. His hard work had paid off, and he created something that would help both himself and others. But coming up with the right idea is just the beginning. The next step is to come up with some simple numbers and build the principles of a business plan. This doesn’t have to be a complex, 100-page document with financial projections for the next two decades, but a simple document that lays out how your company will work and how much money it’ll take to make it happen. The key here is to keep it logical and easy to understand. That’s because the more precisely you write, the better people will comprehend and believe in your idea. It’s really not necessary to throw around complicated figures. You just need to explain how you’ll make money and if it will cover your costs. For instance, when the author first set up CD Baby, he only used two numbers: how much it would cost musicians to list their CD on the site and how much they would make on each sale. These simple, fixed numbers were enough to calculate his projected success. It might be hard to settle on a specific group you want to sell products to, but defining a target market is key to meeting your customers’ needs. A good strategy is to develop many small customer groups, rather than one big one, making a flexible and secure business. For instance, imagine crafting your product or service to meet the needs of a single client with the hopes that she’ll invest more in your company. In doing so you, base just about every decision on her thoughts and desires. But what if she suddenly changes her mind and drops out? Your business would be in ruins because you put the needs of one customer above all the others. So, it’s better to work out which group of customers is the most important and how you can satisfy the needs of the majority. By doing so, you’ll be more flexible and independent, and won’t suffer when one client decides to move on. As a bonus, you’ll also have access to hundreds of opinions to guide your strategy. In any case, you can’t expect to please everyone. In fact, as your business grows, you’ll likely get lots of requests from all different types of people. When this happens, it’s key to remember that you don’t need to fulfill all of them to be successful. Actually, quite the opposite is true. Just stick to your principles and remember the promises you’ve made to your customers. So if something feels wrong, don’t do it. It’s absolutely fine to let some people’s desires go unfulfilled. For instance, the author constantly got requests from record label execs who wanted their newest talent on the site. But he would continually refuse them since the shop was specifically designed for musicians without a label. That’s because, when the site was born 15 years ago, these musicians had no other distribution options. When most people talk about starting a business, their focus is on securing enough money before really investing in the idea. But having zero funding can actually be a huge advantage. In fact, there’s nothing wrong with financial limitations. You just need to start with the bare minimum. So, if you’re hard up for cash but you’ve got a grand vision for your business’s future, don’t worry. Money isn’t what makes ideas grow. Being useful to people is, and that should be your main focus. Just use the resources available to you, whether personal or otherwise, even if they seem insufficient. For instance, say you want to start a tutoring company but don’t have the money to make it happen right away. Don’t let go of the idea, just start teaching somebody something today. You’ll begin identifying potential customers and be spreading your knowledge. In fact, being strapped for cash actually boosts creativity. That’s because major funders can buy you the best equipment, hire a top-tier staff and rent the fanciest office, but are those the things you need? Often, lacking the money for material luxuries helps you brainstorm creative solutions to make things easier, faster and cheaper. In the best cases, you’ll even expand your own knowledge. For instance, plenty of people are dead broke but have a great sense of style – some are even better dressed than rich people. That’s because they only buy items that they truly love that go well with what they have, and which provide myriad styling possibilities. So, having little or no money can make your job harder and take longer, but the long-term effect will be a business based on personal knowledge and creative problem solving. We all know the saying “the customer is always right” and it’s clear that satisfying customers is essential to a thriving business. After all, they buy your products! Knowing this, you should base decisions on your customers’ needs. That’s because a good business isn’t just about you or making money: it’s about the people you serve. So listen to what they want and make it happen. For instance, your business began with an idea: one that would make certain people’s lives easier. And it’s key for this vision to remain central in all your business decisions. So you should be basing decisions on customer feedback rather than your wealthiest investor or your bottom line. Because if you consider what your customers would say about the decisions you’re faced with, you’ll be putting your company on a path to profitability. But if the unthinkable happens and your business is struggling to stay afloat, don’t let yourself get trapped in survival mode. Most companies endeavor to constantly grow and expand, but sometimes the best decision is to simply give up. After all, every business idea sets out to satisfy a need or solve a problem, but what if that need disappears or that problem is suddenly fixed? For instance, if musicians found an easy way to set up their own online store, CD Baby would lose its entire business base. In fact, the author recognized this possibility, but he didn’t worry about it. That’s because his goal was to solve a problem and, if the solution was already there without him, he could move on to solving a new problem. So, while it can sometimes be difficult to keep in touch with your customers, it’s absolutely essential to success. Just remember: as long as you have something valuable to offer, people will be happy to hear about it. What do most self-employed people have in common? They have no clue how to delegate. This can be a major pitfall since developing a delegation mindset is an absolute must if you want to protect your precious resources from depletion. After all, if you start a business yourself, doing everything alone, it can be difficult to suddenly start sharing responsibilities. Many entrepreneurs struggle to even find the time to hire and train employees to take over certain tasks. But failing to delegate could lead to something much worse: burning out. Therefore, it’s crucial to find the time to formally train your employees. For instance, you could develop a training manual. It’s easy to do. Simply keep a running list of problems you encounter while starting and running your business along with ways to solve them. As time goes on, employees will learn to solve issues on their own and you’ll be free to focus on strategic tasks or other interests. So, failing to delegate is dangerous but over-delegating can be a disaster. To stay safe, be sure your delegation is based on trust and control. Here’s how: First of all, make sure to cultivate a trusting relationship with your employees. Let them know you’re sharing responsibilities with them because you have faith in them. Second, put in place some simple control mechanisms. You shouldn’t surveil your staff, but you should develop some rules and procedures everyone abides by. For instance, the author doled out a lot of tasks, giving his employees a great deal of freedom to choose their work style. But then he got a call from his accountant, saying that a profit-sharing plan was being put in place based on a decision made by a staff person. This particular employee had decided that all the company’s profits should be divided among the staff without the author even knowing about it, at which point the author realized he had delegated too much. Plenty of people have dreams of being a CEO at some point in their careers while others envision it being a management nightmare. How do you feel about it? If you’re in the group that shudders at the thought of being in a conventional CEO management position, but still want to start a business, don’t do it. There are going to be tasks that you simply don’t want to do – and you shouldn’t feel the pressure to fill a position that will make you unhappy. For instance, say you opened a restaurant because you love to be in the kitchen. But, as the restaurant grew, you found yourself with less and less time to actually cook. Now your job consists of logistics, management and running a company – a reality you never bargained for. The same holds true for your employees. That is, they also need to take pleasure in what they do. To make this a reality, you shouldn’t ask your employees what they’re good at, but what they enjoy. And remember: you don’t need to have conventional positions like Head of Finance and Head of Marketing. You can simply let your employees choose positions and titles based on their passions. By doing so, you’ll find that there are people excited to tackle even the most annoying tasks! And, finally, keep in mind that traditional business strategies might not work for your way of doing things. So, whatever consultants or so-called “experts” might tell you, running a business is a creative task that calls for creative strategies. For example, if your only goal is to cover costs and you aren’t interested in growing, that’s totally fine. If you just want to run a small tech startup without any dreams of being the next Steve Jobs or being bought out by Apple, that’s your decision. Even things that seem absolutely normal, such as constantly posting to social media, are still decisions you should make for yourself, without fear of judgement. The key message in this book: Starting a successful business is just a matter of finding a great idea, harnessing the will to satisfy your customers and creatively solving your problems. So, while it might not be the norm, forget about huge sums of venture capital and consultants; just set your mind to making your business dream become a reality. Actionable advice: Make business choices that work for you. The way you make decisions in business is personal. So, when faced with questions about your company’s future, make sure you answer them in the way that works best for you. For instance, while it might be the norm to start at 9 a.m., you might find that a workday that starts later is better for you and your employees.

    "title": "Arise, Awake",
    "author": "Rashmi Bansal",
    "summary": "The world’s economic center of gravity is shifting eastward. Few nations better encapsulate that transition than India, a country of 1.3 billion people with an economy that’s been growing at a rate of over five percent annually for over a decade now. Much of this growth has come from a new generation of entrepreneurs, young go-getters who are redefining the way business in India is done. But facts and figures only tell half the story. If you really want to experience what this golden age of entrepreneurship feels like on the ground, you have to get up close and personal with the men and women reshaping the subcontinent. That’s just what Rashmi Bansal does in these blinks. Chock-full of inspiring insights and real-life tales of grit and determination, these portraits of six up-and-coming entrepreneurs whisk readers from Bombay to Bangalore and reveal how the new generation is redefining the business landscape in today’s India. You’ll also discover: how a failed beverage venture ended up launching a top youth brand to success; why businesses that solve problems close to home go on to thrive; and how a software start-up attracted the attention of Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Back in the early 2000s, “entrepreneurship” wasn’t a particularly well-known concept in India. One university wanted to change that. The National Institute of Technology Karnataka – NITK for short – was one of the few places you could find an entrepreneurship cell in the country. Its so-called Eforea “E-cell” was designed as a launching pad for talented youngsters working on the next big thing. Shashank ND, an NITK student from Bangalore, joined Eforea in his second year. Up to that point he’d been a pretty average student who’d only really distinguished himself in extracurricular campus activities. The events organized by the e-cell, however, changed the course of his life. Listening to top business gurus like rediff.com founder Ajit Balakrishnan talk about their experiences helped Shashank discover his true vocation: entrepreneurship. He didn’t have to look far for a partner, either – his future collaborator Abhinav Lal was also an Eforea member. The two would-be world-changers started small. Their idea? To create software for doctors. After borrowing 10,000 rupees – roughly USD $145 – from Shashank’s mother, they registered their company under the name Practo Technologies. Things were still fairly vague, but that didn’t deter Shashank and Abhinav. The duo organized a big presentation and invited 25 local doctors. But the event was a disaster. Shashank felt uncomfortable in his ill-fitting suit, and their business pitch largely fell on deaf ears. One medical practitioner in the room – Mohammed Ali – wasn’t quite so quick to dismiss what he’d heard. He told the two budding entrepreneurs to persevere, and even gave them an idea to work on. Ali had noticed that his patients often needed to be reminded of their regular checkups. Wouldn’t it be simpler, he wondered, if those reminders could be automated? Shashank and Abhinav got to work designing the software to do just that. Their prototype was simple, but Ali was delighted with the automated SMS reminders it sent out. Encouraged by this success, the NTIK graduates committed their futures to Practo. In 2010, their hard work paid off. Sequoia Capital, an American venture capital firm that had backed Apple and Google in the tech giants’ early days, decided to invest in the medical start-up. It was exactly the boost Practo needed. By 2015, the firm was worth almost three million US dollars, and its services were being used by 10,000 doctors across India. Sourabh Bansal’s story starts in a student dorm or, as it’s called in India, a hostel. It was one of those wide-ranging, late-night discussions that take place among undergraduates the world over. What, they asked each other, would they do with their lives? Sourabh leaped to his feet, grabbed a pencil and scribbled a number on the wall: 50 billion rupees. That, he said, was how much his company would be worth one day. How was he going to make all that cash? That’s where serendipity played its part. Sourabh’s father owned a factory manufacturing quicklime, a compound used by the building industry to make concrete blocks. Sourabh had occasionally helped out in the plant for years. One day, he noticed an unusual order: a customer had purchased thousands of tons of lime to make “autoclaved aerated concrete,” or AAC blocks. When he looked into the matter, Sourabh discovered that these were ten times larger than standard bricks and a whopping 70 percent lighter. The only issue with this wonder material was that it was prohibitively expensive. That was Sourabh’s eureka moment. Whoever figured out how to lower the cost of AAC blocks would practically conquer an entire market overnight! The wheels were in motion, and Sourabh began experimenting with cheaper production techniques. All he needed was someone to help him get his idea off the ground. In Surat, Sourabh’s hometown in western India, investors usually take the form of “uncles” – wealthy family acquaintances willing to take a gamble on new businesses. The uncle who invested in Sourabh’s company was called Rajesh Poddar. In return for a 70 percent equity stake, Poddar invested 100 million rupees in what became Magicrete Building Solutions. It was a sound decision. Sourabh’s experiments were successful: using a coal-fired boiler instead of the diesel boilers other firms relied on, he’d reduced his manufacturing costs by over 60 percent. By 2009, Magicrete’s first AAC blocks were rolling off the production line. It didn’t take the construction industry long to cotton on, and orders were soon flying in. It wasn’t all plain sailing from there, but Magicrete continued to expand at a steady clip. Six years later, it was bringing in 1.5 billion rupees a year and was well on its way to that 50 billion goal! The Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resources Development is known as the best place to study HR in India. It was that reputation that brought Prakash Mundhra to the university, but he soon decided he’d had enough and devoted himself to entrepreneurship instead. Increasingly fascinated by the business world, Prakash began working on his own ideas. That’s when he came across Business Baazigar, a TV show on which contestants submit their business plans and winners receive the funding they need to turn their dreams into reality. The format was perfect for an idea Prakash had been developing for a school competition: kits containing full sets of the items used in puja or “worship” on special occasions like the Hindu festival of Diwali. Around 200,000 business plans were submitted to Business Baazigar, but Prakash managed to squeeze into the top twenty. He was given 50,000 rupees to create a prototype and invited to appear on the actual show when filming started in February 2005. Although he was eventually eliminated after joining the final round of ten contestants, the experience played a vital role in Prakash’s career. Being challenged to produce a sample product gave him a much better understanding of the raw materials he’d need, the size of the market and the competition he’d face. Even more importantly, it gave him the confidence to continue refining his business idea. Prakash returned to school, but his heart wasn’t in it – what he really wanted to do was continue developing his business. He began applying to business plan contests at schools across India, winning five out of the six he entered. After graduating, he was finally ready to set up his own company. Named Sacred Moments, it initially specialized in Diwali “puja kits,” which sold like hotcakes. Prakash then began expanding his product line to cater to a wider range of festivities and occasions. Today, Sacred Moments has seven full-time employees and many more seasonal workers. The hours might be long, but that doesn’t bother Prakash one bit – he loves his work and believes he’s privileged to be able to work for himself and on his own ideas. Like many of the entrepreneurs we’ve met so far, Prabhkiran Singh wasn’t really sure what he wanted to do with his life when he went to university. He worked hard at the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, but he knew the subject he was studying – civil engineering – wasn’t his true calling. What Prabhkiran was sure about was that he wanted to work for himself, but he couldn’t settle on a business idea. That changed in 2009 after he happened to try a flavored lassi, an Indian drink traditionally made with yoghurt, water, salt and spices. The strawberry-flavored lassi Prabhkiran tried was a different beverage altogether. Inspired by the idea of creating a more modern style of lassi, he and his best friend pooled their savings to buy a mixer, a blender and some basic kitchen tools. They eventually rented a small space outside a cake shop for the equivalent of about USD $86. In February 2010, Khadke Glassi opened its doors. Thanks to Facebook advertising and word of mouth, news of the venture spread. Soon enough, thirsty customers were lining up to try the company’s lassis. By June, things were going so well that Prabhkiran decided to open a second location in a shopping center. There was just one catch: sales were heavily reliant on the weather. When it changed for the worse, Khadke Glassi went from selling 50 to just five glasses a day. That wasn’t sustainable, and in September the business closed its doors for good. Failure is bitter, but – as Prabhkiran would discover – it can impart useful lessons. As he was shuttering his lassi business, he noticed his friend Siddharth tinkering with a humorous website he’d created called Bewakoof, meaning “foolish” in Hindi. Prabhkiran had a flash of inspiration and decided to team up with Siddarth and make t-shirts promoting the site. Finding investors to back this new venture wasn’t easy, but his experience with Khadke Glassi had given Prabhkiran a thick skin. He persevered and eventually received seed funding from a fellow university student. Bewakoof Brands, as the company was now called, gradually established itself as one of India’s most exciting youth brands, selling over 200 shirts a day. By 2014, it had 150 employees and an annual turnover of 500 million rupees – not bad for a venture dreamed up in the wreckage of a failed business! Every young Indian who wants to study law dreams of being admitted to the National Law School in Bangalore. Not everyone makes it through the rigorous application process, but Aruj Garg did. After a brief honeymoon period, he had a change of heart: what really interested him wasn’t law but entrepreneurship. No wonder – business is all about solving problems, and Aruj was a natural problem-solver. Even better, he’d come up with an answer to a problem familiar to students across India: poor-quality canteen food. Realizing there was a huge market for tastier alternatives, he put together a crowd-pleasing menu featuring pizza, sandwiches and burgers inspired by the fast food chain Subway. He rented a small space near campus for 1000 rupees a month and opened his restaurant in May 2011. Its name? Bhukkad, Hindi slang for a food-obsessed person. It was a hit: within a month, Aruj was making between 2000 and 3000 rupees a day. The business might have been sustainable but Aruj’s eating habits weren’t. In 2013, he discovered that his cholesterol levels were dangerously high and he’d have to cut down on processed foods, including all-time personal favorites like chips and ice cream. That severely limited his options when it came to eating out. It was the start of a thought process that would culminate in Bhukkad 2.0 – a restaurant serving delicious food that was both fast and healthy. Shifting his focus to natural and fresh ingredients, Aruj came up with a new “Bhukkad Code” which banished processed meat, white bread and pre-packaged dressings and sauces from the company’s menu. These were replaced by offerings like the signature Asian green salad – a mix of beans, cauliflower and lettuce finished with a lime-honey dressing and peanut garnish. Bhukkad’s high-quality, health-conscious fast food was an even bigger hit than the carb-driven fare it had previously sold, driving sales up by 30 percent! Today, Bhukkad has three full-time employees in three outlets and is looking to expand once it finds the right investor. Aruj, meanwhile, is still in his twenties! There’s clearly plenty of money to be made satisfying students’ hunger, but what about their need for accommodation? Like canteens, student digs often leave a lot to be desired. Take it from Anurag Arora. When he started his course at the ICFAI Business School in Pune, Maharashtra, he was asked to pay 48,000 rupees up-front to live in a privately run hostel, as the university didn’t have its own dormitories. That’s a lot of cash for what he got: a shabby room in a run-down, badly managed building that didn’t even have hot water! Anurag stuck it out for three days before deciding he’d had enough and moving into a private apartment with a couple of pals, forfeiting his entire downpayment. In the summer of 2013, Anurag noticed that incoming students were posting questions about their future accommodation on the university’s Facebook page. By that point, the campus had moved to a different neighborhood in Pune where there weren’t even private hostels. That’s when Anurag hit on the idea of opening a hostel of his own. Because he was known as a good student, the school took his scheme seriously. Having been given the go-ahead, and with the new students due to arrive in just a couple of weeks, Anurag got to work. He reached out to apartment brokers and started inspecting suitable properties. But there was a snag: he didn’t have any start-up capital. Rather than letting that deter him, he used his own apartment to showcase his service and promised students that their own rooms would be just as clean and well-furnished as his. When his first client signed on the dotted line and paid the 56,000 rupees in annual fees, Anurag had enough money to cover the deposit on his first five apartments. Furnishing one of those gave him a new model for future customers. After that, things started to snowball: new clients provided more cash, which in turn paid for the deposits on more apartments. Anurag’s company, Ganpati Facilities, was soon making a net profit of 2.5 million rupees every month! That’s a great example of how far a bit of lateral thinking and lots of determination can get you. Like the other entrepreneurs we’ve encountered in these blinks, Anurag didn’t wait for the perfect job to drop into his lap – he went out there and created it for himself. The key message in these blinks: It doesn’t matter where or what you study, you can turn your dreams of business success into reality – and you don’t even have to wait till you’re through with school! As these six young Indian go-getters’ stories show, what really makes the difference when it comes to getting a company off the ground is determination, elbow grease and a thick skin. So if you’re sitting on the next big thing, get out there and start hustling! Actionable advice: Get your product out in the world ASAP! Ideas are great, but nothing gets the ball rolling like putting your product out in the world. So once you’ve developed your product idea, don’t hesitate – hit Google and find your material suppliers and start putting your prototype together. Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to begin road-testing it – after all, no one can help you figure out whether you’re onto a winner like the people who’ll be using your product. Got feedback?

What to read next: The Entrepreneur Roller Coaster, by Darren Hardy If the lesson you’ve taken away from these blinks is that anyone can turn their brilliant idea into a money-spinner, great – that was the idea! But even if you’re 99 percent sure that you’re onto a winner, there’s always that niggling one percent of doubt to hold you back. That’s hardly surprising: going it alone can be pretty scary, especially when you’re used to the certainty of a monthly paycheck. But you don’t have to reinvent the wheel – in fact, you’re best off learning from the entrepreneurial veterans who’ve already been through the process. So if you want the lowdown on everything a self-starter needs to know about sales, leadership, recruiting and productivity, check out our blinks to The Entrepreneur Roller Coaster, by Darren Hardy.",

    "title": "Ask",
    "author": "Ryan Levesque",
    "summary": "Anyone who’s ever shopped online or started an online store knows that online businesses are plagued by inefficiency. Visitors to websites usually leave them rapidly; there’s nothing they want to buy, so they close the window or move on to another site. The problem is that you can’t just ask people what they want and then provide them with it. That’s where the Ask Formula comes in. The Ask Formula is a series of surveys that you can give to prospective customers and current customers. As these blinks explain, once people take your surveys, you’ll know what people’s biggest challenges are and how you can solve them. And solving such problems is what will put your business ahead of the competition. In these blinks, you’ll learn why nobody knows what they want; how to win over people who rejected your first offer; and which email subject headings will get people to open them. The Ask Formula was conceived as a solution to a problem faced by every business owner: how to learn what customers and prospects want? Knowing what is wanted positions businesses to personalize services and answer customer needs. So how do you find out what is wanted? Well, you could simply send out a survey. Traditional surveys, however, come with several inherent problems. First, surveys are irritating. Remember the last time your dinner was interrupted by a telemarketer asking for your opinion on a thrilling topic like new soda bottle brand packaging? Exactly – irritating. Second, there’s no real incentive to answer a survey, since the customers don’t have access to the results. In general, surveys are designed by marketers to help marketers. Other approaches to asking customers fail because people are only good at two things: expressing what they don’t want and saying what they already have. Businesses want to know what people want – but those same businesses are no good at helping potential customers figure out what that thing might be. For example, if you’re browsing the shelves at a store and a salesperson asks, “How can I help you?”, she’s not helping you make a choice. Rather, she’s assuming that you already know what you want so that she can help you find it. But most potential customers have no idea what they want! Just think about the last time you tried to decide where to go out to eat with a group of friends. If you ask them what they want to eat, you enter an endless loop of suggestions and questions, and no decision gets made. But as a business you still have to find out what people want, even when they can’t quite articulate it. The Ask Formula will help you do this by using surveys in a different and unexpected way. So, traditional surveys don’t work. They annoy customers and don’t offer any useful information. So how is the Ask Formula any different? For starters, the Ask Formula relies on a Survey Funnel strategy, that is, the combination of steps that transform your prospects into paying customers. We’ll take a closer look at each step in later blinks, so for now, before you start the funnel, you need to construct a Deep Dive Survey. You’ll only conduct this survey once, at the very beginning of the process; it uncovers who your prospective customers really are. The Deep Dive Survey begins with an email to your list of prospects. These could be current fans or former customers. The email should quickly introduce your company and explain that you’d like to get to know your potential customers better. For example, you might write, “Here at Home Lighting, we want to know who our customers are so we can give them the best service.” Then comes a small sample of survey questions. Remember, your prospects only know what they don’t want, so it’s not worth directly asking what they want. Instead, you have to coax it out of them with questions like, “What is the biggest challenge you’re struggling with right now?” Next, direct respondents to complete the survey on a website where you can collect the answers. Finally, collect and analyze the survey data. Look for answer patterns and sort them into buckets, that is, similar groups of prospects. For example, if you are a B2B company, one bucket could be companies that earn less than $500,000 annually, another for those with more than $5 million, and so on. By organizing respondents into buckets, you can learn the natural consumer language to use when communicating with each group. You wouldn’t want to write an email to your retiree bucket in the technical language of your software geek bucket! Once you know who your prospects are, it’s time to move on to the next step. Thanks to the Deep Dive Survey, you should have a good idea of who your prospects are. The next step is getting them to tell you more; then you can actually start solving their problems. The way you’ll accomplish this is with another survey. In order to entice prospects to take the next survey, you need to design a convincing landing page, called the Prospect Self-Discovery Landing Page. All key information should be available on this page without requiring readers to scroll down. Here’s what the page should look like: Start with a standout headline or question. As an example, the author’s RocketMemory homepage asked, “Is it possible to improve your memory in just three days using these techniques?” Then, tell the prospects your goal and explain how the survey will help you achieve it. For example, you could say something like, “We want to help you diagnose your problem by asking a few questions, and then offer you a customized solution.” Increase participation by adding a video to your landing page. An easy way to do this is with a “talking head” video, in which you or an actor explains your company. Slides with voiceover also work. The key to the video’s success is a good hook – a compelling idea that inspires curiosity and desire. To find it, ask your viewers about their struggle. Whether it’s losing weight or improving their tennis serve, a good hook will grab their interest, enticing them to take the next survey. Not everyone is easily persuaded, however. Skeptics can be coaxed with if-then statements, like: “If you work with diverse markets but aren’t sure how to communicate with all of them, then…” Finally, introduce the survey to your prospects by hinting at your expertise. Write something like, “For ten years now I’ve asked my clients a series of questions that helped identify their biggest sales bottleneck.” Once you’ve won over your prospects, they’ll eagerly click the link and begin the next survey. So, your prospects are hooked and ready to take your survey. Now it’s time to deliver your Micro-Commitment Bucket Survey. This survey starts with small, non-threatening, multiple-choice questions, before moving on to more private questions, such as name and email. It starts this way because people are reluctant to divulge personal information and little questions chip away at that reluctance. It’s important to phrase these questions in a highly conversational way – not a robotic one. For example, “What’s your favorite soda brand?” is a far better question than “Which market-leading soda manufacturer do you most prefer?” Your Micro-Commitment Bucket Survey should start with easily answerable questions – “How old are you?” for instance. Use this data to personalize messages by, for instance, referring to your prospects’ age in a follow-up email. Finally, use segmentation questions to help characterize your prospects and funnel them into different buckets. Avoid the temptation to segment by demographic (age, location, etc.) and instead try to ask questions that will segment prospects according to the specific challenges or problems they want to solve. For example, you might ask the multiple choice questions, “Which of the following is your biggest challenge right now?” with the answers “Selling to multiple sub markets,” “Making paid traffic convert,” and “Entering a new market.” Each answer gives you insight into your customer’s specific problem. Now it’s time to sort the data you’ve received. In the Deep Dive Survey, you created buckets. Using the Micro-Commitment Bucket Survey, you’ll fill and refine these buckets. For example, if you’re a car manufacturer, you could sort prospects first according to their marital status and then sub-segment these buckets with the number of children in each family. This type of segmentation is invaluable for future promotions, as it helps you introduce relevant products to your customers in a marketing language they understand. The very last thing you’ll do is send your prospects to a capture page, where they’ll enter their name and email address. After submitting their survey, prospects will land on your Post-Survey page, where they’ll receive a diagnosis of their problem and a solution to it. This page will be nothing but a headline and a video offering personalized feedback to the concerns they shared in the survey. If you were a doctor, this would be where you offer your patient a prognosis and walk them through the various treatment options. You wouldn’t rush them into surgery or talk about costs! Your goal here is to demonstrate that you understand what they’re going through and motivate them to ask you what they should do about it? That’s when you make your sales pitch. Like your landing page, your sales pitch should also include a video, preferably using the Problem, Agitate, Solution formula: introduce the prospect’s problem, reinforce its severity and urgency and then explain its solution. Start by providing a creatively named diagnosis. For example, you might tell the viewer: “Based on the information you’ve provided, your marketing bottleneck is caused by the Cold Traffic Curse.” Your diagnosis should immediately spark your prospects’ curiosity and make them want to learn more. Next, explain what your diagnosis means. Demonstrate that you understand their problem and focus on its urgency and severity, while also showing that you care about the outcome. Going with our previous example: “Many websites today face the Cold Traffic Curse, preventing them from converting visitors into customers and threatening business.” Finally, explain your solution by turning education into an offer. Your offer should include the benefit, that is, what’s in it for your customers when they purchase; a description of the offer; the discount price or special deal available; and the primary reason why they need to act now (like deadlines or limited availability). Up to this point, the Ask Formula has helped you identify customer problems so that you can solve their specific problems. In our final blinks, you’ll learn how you can make the most of these new conversions. The Ask Formula doesn’t end with this first offer on the Post-Survey page. Rather, it aims to drive sales well into the future. But how? Once you’ve generated a customer, the real benefit comes from the extended relationship you’ll have with that customer as you sell to them over time. This is where the Profit Maximization Upsell sequence comes into play. Think about your latest visit to McDonald’s. They don’t make billions in sales simply because people buy burgers. Rather, they ask, “Do you want fries with that?” Once someone has already decided to make a purchase, they’re in a buying mindset and thus much more likely to spend more money right then and there. Thus, directly after your prospect makes their initial purchase, present them with one or more one-click upsell opportunities that don’t require them to re-enter payment information. One option might simply be to sell more of what the customer just purchased, but at a discounted price. For instance, if you sell protein powder, you could offer three discounted tubs of powder with each new purchase. Another option is to sell a faster, easier result. If you sell a gym membership online, for example, you could target the people who expect fast results and propose a 30-day pass to a fat-burn boot camp in addition to the membership. Finally, you could offer a solution to a problem that your prospects hadn’t even thought about yet but will surely face after getting results from your initial product. To conceptualize this, imagine that you sell a salary-negotiation course, which helps people argue for higher wages. You now have the opportunity to help customers with the new “good” problem of having excess cash. Your upsell could emphasize the importance of investing their excess money wisely and offer a complementary program focused on investment. This is typically a “good” problem that your clients don’t have yet but may be facing soon. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of visitors – possibly as low as ten percent – will buy after this first round of surveys. But don’t give up on the other 90 percent! The Ask Formula has a special way of following up with these reluctant prospects to win their business. Email follow-ups offer a constant string of communication that helps optimize and improve the marketing funnel through the Email Follow-Up Feedback Loop. There are two types of email sequences: one for non-buyers and another for buyers. Let’s start by focusing on following up with non-buyers, those who didn’t immediately buy the offer presented at the post-survey sales prescription. Emails to non-buyers have to be highly engaging in order to rescue a sale. One way to keep them engaged is to tweak the offer without devaluing the product by offering discount after discount. Try lowering the threshold of commitment – by offering, for example, a one-dollar trial period with the full amount due at a later date. In addition, urgency emails can be used to remind non-buyers of your offer’s time limitation. Knowing that an offer is only valid for another hour could convince some non-buyers to pull out their wallets. Lastly, if the initial offer failed, give people the opportunity to pivot and choose their own next step by simply starting the Ask Formula cycle again, this time focusing on a different kind of product. Luckily, you can use a similar process to get more from your buyers, but this time you’ll prime them for another purchase by leveraging the joy they got from the product you already sold them. A good way to entice buyers to open your emails is to put an incomplete thought in the subject line. For example, “Where there’s a will there’s a…” tickles the reader’s curiosity and entices them to read on. In the body, you should include a link that directs them to your offer; that’ll turn these one-time customers into repeat buyers. The key message in this book: If you want to know what your customers really want, the best thing to do is to ask. The trick is to ask in the right way, using an organized system that pulls actionable information from prospects while also building trust and intrigue. In other words, you need the Ask Formula. Actionable advice: Nothing-fits-all. There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution. Everyone’s situation is unique and thus the solutions that are best for each individual customer will likewise need to be unique.

    "title": "Be Fearless",
    "author": "Jean Case",
    "summary": "If you follow the news, you may have read a troubling article one day and thought, “I should really do something about this.” Maybe it was a local issue, like homelessness, or an international issue, like the environment. But despite your concern and your initial impulse to take action, your second thought may have been: “I’d like to help, but I can’t just change my life now. It’s too risky!” Author Jean Case understands that taking action requires courage and that it’s much easier to do nothing or stay on autopilot. But these days we need courageous people who want to make the world a better place, so she’s decided to offer inspiration to those who need that extra push to replace those fears of doing something new with courage and fearlessness. According to Case, the five principles for being fearless are to make a Big Bet; be a bold risk-taker; make failures matter; reach beyond your bubble; and let urgency conquer fear. We’ll take a look at some examples of these principles in action and hopefully empower your inner game-changer to step forward.   In these blinks you’ll find which trailblazing woman brought cherry trees to Washington DC; why a lack of failures can be a troubling warning sign; and why overthinking has its downsides. Back at the start of the 1960s, no one knew exactly how the first human was going to set foot on the moon. But even though there were a lot of hurdles in the way, including the small fact that the technology had yet to be invented, US president John F. Kennedy made a bold promise on national TV, announcing to the world that the astronomical feat would be completed within the decade.     The author refers to this kind of idea as making a Big Bet, and it’s the first principle behind being the kind of fearless person who makes a difference in the world. A Big Bet is the kind of audacious plan that defies common assumptions and grabs people’s attention. Much like JFK did in 1961, the audacious entrepreneur Elon Musk has made the Big Bet of getting us to Mars by 2030. And while he’s at it, as CEO of the electric car company Tesla, he’s betting on revolutionizing the way people travel here on Earth. Elon Musk has had his fair share of detractors, but in January of 2018 his SpaceX program silenced some of those critics when it successfully launched its own rocket. Now, space travel is one thing, but how does balloon-powered internet browsing sound? According to Astro Teller, the innovator who oversees X, a development lab founded by Google, creating a balloon-powered internet was the craziest project of the lab so far. And it was a success, helping Puerto Rico get back online after Hurricane Maria in 2017. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to make a Big Bet. In fact, you can make one wherever you may be in life at this moment. Take Rachel Sumekh, for instance, who was just a normal student at UCLA when, in 2010, she found herself to be the only person who showed up for a food drive to help fellow students who couldn’t afford decent meals. It was just one sign of how underappreciated the issue of student hunger is, despite the fact that in some states one out of every four college students has had to visit a food bank or was not always able to buy groceries. Sumekh made the Big Bet that this long-standing problem could change, and she started Swipe Out Hunger, an organization that lets other students donate their unused food card money. Eventually, her efforts caught the attention of Barack Obama and has now spread to over 30 campuses while delivering over 1.3 million meals. There’s a good chance that at some point you’ve been frustrated by something only to have someone shrug and tell you, “That’s just the way it is!” A lot of people assume things are the way they are and there’s no use trying to change anything. But then there are the fearless people who defy these common assumptions and show us that things can change for the better. Two such people are David Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal. One day, Gilboa needed to replace his glasses and was disturbed to find that a new pair would end up costing him around $700. He felt that there ought be a way to get some decent specs without breaking the bank. Most people just assumed that the process of getting eyeglasses – which included visiting a shop to spend hundreds of dollars on an eye exam, lenses and frames – was set in stone. But Blumenthal had worked with an organization called VisionSpring, which worked with people in developing countries, training them in how to perform eye tests and run shops that sold glasses that people making under four dollars a day could afford. So there was a less-expensive way, and to prove it Blumenthal and Gilboa got just $2,500 in seed money to launch Warby Parker, an online service that offered a stylish selection of glasses priced at just $95 a pair. The response proved that you could indeed sell glasses online, with their entire inventory selling out within the first month and a waiting list of 20,000 customers soon forming. These days, Warby Parker is worth $1.75 billion, with dozens of stores and around 1,400 employees. Along with questioning assumptions, a Big Bet can also help you peek around the corner and see what the future holds. Back in the 1990s, there were people who couldn’t fathom why they’d need to create a website for their business, or even get an email account. Nowadays it’s hard to fathom how we got by without the internet. The author was among a group in the 1980s who recognized the future potential of the internet and wasn’t swayed by the many people who expressed bewilderment in her desire to work for the start-up that would one day turn into America Online. You probably like being in your comfort zone, right? Who doesn’t? But while you may be able to do good work in that zone, the reality is that you’re not going to do amazing, game-changing work while you’re comfortable. To change the world, you need to get uncomfortable. Which brings us to the second principle of being fearless: be bold and take chances. Imagine the progress that would – or rather wouldn’t – have been made if people only strove for comfort. Or how about all the exciting things we wouldn’t accomplish if we only took on the jobs we’re completely confident we’ll manage. It doesn’t sound very exciting at all, does it? Many women and minorities can speak to the discomfort of being the only one of their kind in a workplace. There’s not only the awkwardness of feeling different, there’s also the pressure of feeling like your work is representing a whole gender or ethnicity. While the author feels grateful for being the first female Chairman of the National Geographic Society, she also feels indebted to Eliza Scidmore, who was the first female board member of the society back in 1892. Scidmore was remarkable in many ways, and it’s due in part to the fact that she lived a life that embraced the risk inherent in being a trailblazer. At 19, she was part of Oberlin College’s first graduating class that allowed women. From there she wrote a popular newspaper column under the androgynous pen name of E.R. Scidmore, which earned her enough money to fulfill her dream of travelling and seeing the world. In 1885, she boarded a steamship to Alaska, a full 75 years before it became part of the US. After arriving, she wrote the first travel guide to the area – a truly daunting feat! This led to Scidmore becoming the first female writer and photographer for National Geographic magazine, a role that took her to far-flung lands, including India, China, Indonesia, Russia and Korea. As a single mom of two at the end of the nineteenth century, one can only imagine how difficult and risky such trips would’ve been for Scidmore. But she had an urge to change the world and she accepted that such risks and discomforts were part of it. It’s important to know about trailblazers like Eliza Scidmore, because the work they did and the doors they opened can make it easier for you today. While changing the world is never going to be a walk in the park, it doesn’t mean that you have to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time. Even an inventor like Thomas Edison was well aware of the importance of using what came before. People tend to think of Edison as being a genius who was repeatedly struck by so-called eureka moments, where ideas like the light bulb came to him purely as the result of his brilliant mind. But even Edison referred to himself as “more of a sponge than an inventor.” That’s because he was highly aware of the advances that others were making, and how he could offer his own resources and know-how to make these advances even better. A more recent example is Justin Knopf, a fifth generation farmer who learned about the no tilling approach to farming. The issue of soil erosion and topsoil being blown away is still a problem, just as it was back in the days of the dust bowl, and no tilling offers a way for farmers to keep more of their soil undisturbed. When Knopf heard about this he thought it may also help retain more of the natural nutrients in his soil, a topic he’d been learning about in school. Sure enough, once he started testing he saw amazing results and before long the size of his yields were growing exponentially. Knopf has been open in sharing what he’s learned and he’s now considered a leader of a full-blown no tilling movement. Changing the way you do things can be a risky proposition, but if you want to avoid regrets you’ll likely want to start taking those bold chances. The most common regret people have later in life isn’t that they chose to do something risky; it’s rather that they chose to play it safe. Just look at what happened to Kodak. Before the 2000s, the company was the leader in camera film, with around 70 percent of the total market. When presented with the decision of investing in digital film or protecting this market share they decided to stick with the status quo. By 2003, digital camera sales were outpacing film cameras, and in 2012 Kodak filed for bankruptcy. The lesson is clear: Unless you want a life of regrets, you have to take risks. Most people won’t throw a celebration when a project has failed and yet you might be surprised to find how many of the big game-changers see failure as a good thing. They know that behind every success story you’ll find failures, because they’re often an integral part of the process. That’s why the third principle of being fearless is to make your failures matter. For starters, when you have a healthy attitude toward failure, you can learn a lot. As IBM founder Thomas J. Watson once advised, if you really want to succeed, you should double your rate of failure. For example, at the author’s Case Foundation, which funds bold innovative projects, a lack of failures would be a clear warning sign that the projects are not innovative enough. After all, when every project should be pushing the boundaries of what is possible, there should be a healthy amount of failures. And remember the X lab scientist Astro Teller? He doesn’t just tolerate failure, he expects it. Teller gave a TED Talk called “The Unexpected Benefit of Celebrating Failure” and he explained how at X, they actively try to bring a project down by proving its central conceit wrong. If you can’t, then you know there’s a good chance you have a brilliant idea! Another key to accepting failure as part of the process is to always keep your eye on the bigger picture. A person who is often looked to as one of the most successful people on the planet is Warren Buffett. As a hugely influential investor, Buffett has based his whole philosophy on seeking out businesses that’ll do well in the long run. He doesn’t pay attention to fads or trends. Instead, he’s attracted to businesses with long-term potential. Interestingly enough, Buffett himself could be seen as a late bloomer. The majority of his fortune has been accumulated after his 50th birthday, and between his 83rd and 87th birthdays he earned as much money as he did in his first 60 years. As Albert Einstein once said, “Failure is success in progress.” What really matters isn’t that you managed to avoid failure your entire life, it’s that you went after your goals and learned the lessons behind the inevitable failures that came your way. Every year, the author looks forward to getting in an RV with her husband and travelling around the US. This allows her to see some beautiful scenery, but, crucially, she gets to meet people she wouldn’t normally come across. In other words, these road trips ensure that she gets outside of her bubble, the fourth principle of being fearless. First of all, looking beyond your bubble is critical to understanding what’s truly going on in the world and getting rid of any blind spots or biases you may have. For example, many people are living under the impression that certain US cities such as Pittsburgh or Detroit are dying and should be avoided. But if you saw these places with your own eyes, you’d see that there’s exciting work taking place there. For instance, Ford and Uber are both investing a good deal of money in Pittsburgh due to the groundbreaking work in automated driving going on there. The city is also home to thriving businesses in the fields of biomedicine, robotics and alternative energy. Detroit is another city on the upswing, with exciting partnerships taking place between private and public industries committed to ushering in an economic rebirth. Dan Gilbert, the man behind Quicken Loans, has relocated his entire business to Detroit. The company has around 17,000 employees and has deeply invested in the city’s real estate and start-ups. Looking outside your bubble is also the only way you’ll find that perfect yet unusual partnership that may hold the key to your future. For example, in 2010, NASA and Lego formed an unlikely partnership that found Lego sets being used in the International Space Station while classrooms of students and teachers interacted with the astronauts through a specially-designed curriculum. Thanks to this partnership, there’s a good chance some of those students will look back at those classes as inspiration for a career in astronomy, which is exactly what NASA was hoping for. Another perfect example happened during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. At the time, the hazmat suits being used were flawed. They required 30 steps to put them on and didn’t provide complete protection. So when Johns Hopkins University put out an open call for a better design, who won? A seamstress who specialized in wedding dresses! Indeed, sometimes the best solutions are found in the most unusual places, but you’ll never find them if you don’t step outside your bubble. The final principle of being fearless is to let urgency overpower your fear. Everyone is built to experience fear as a way of protecting us from danger, but it can also get in the way of taking chances, being bold and doing what it takes to make amazing things happen. One way of bypassing this fear is to let urgency take over and give into the kind of instinctual response that kicks in during times of emergency or crisis. When someone’s back is against the wall, this is when adrenaline kicks in and they find themselves doing amazing things that wouldn’t happen in normal circumstances. Fortunately, if you look at what’s going on around you or elsewhere in the world, you’ll likely find a crisis that makes you passionate in wanting to do something to help. Use this passion to your advantage! The author calls the people who take this kind of action first responders and there are many of them who’ve found success in doing amazing things for others. For example, José Andrés is a world-renowned chef with many award-winning restaurants to his name, but he’s also considered “the face of American disaster relief.” That recognition started locally, in Washington DC, where he founded the DC Central Kitchen to help hungry people in the city. But then, in 2010, his mission became the World Hunger Kitchen when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake brought widespread damage to Haiti. But that was just the beginning: after Hurricane Maria caused food and water shortages in Puerto Rico, Andrés started with one kitchen, serving 1,000 meals a day, but quickly ramped up his effort to 175,000 meals a day – eventually giving out 3.5 million meals to the recovering community. As Andrés sees it, the American dream is no longer about securing yourself a fancy house, car or high-paying job. It’s about finding success for yourself through doing something beneficial for others in the world. For Andrés, the urgency of hunger causes him to seize the moment and do what he can to help. For  David Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal, the two behind Warby Parker, it was getting people glasses they could afford, and it’s why they built in the “buy a pair, give a pair” program into their business model. So far, they’ve distributed around four million pairs of glasses to developing countries. You may have been given some well-meaning advice by someone who warned you against being impulsive, telling you to “Make sure you think things through!” The problem is, the more time you spend thinking things through, the more likely it is you’ll end up paralyzed by uncertainty, confusion and exhaustion. In short, any great idea can seem dubious if you spend enough time picking it apart. That’s why it’s helpful to let urgency propel you into action. If you find a cause that inspires passion within you, there’s a good chance it’s worth doing. Sure, there may be issues that you’ll need to deal with, but you can always figure those things out later. That’s what Bertha and Harry Holt did back in 1954 when they heard about homeless children in Korea who had been cast aside for being fathered by American soldiers. Immediately they set about trying to help by adopting eight children. If they’d stopped to think all the details through, they’d have found that this was actually against the law. But instead of letting that stop them, they lobbied Congress and got Holt’s Law passed in 1955, clearing the way for the children to be given a home with their family. The Holts then set up an adoption agency through the Salvation Army to get other children a safe home, and built a residential facility in Seoul to provide them with a safe place to live. That facility is still there today, run by the Holt’s 80-year-old daughter, Molly. There’s even a museum on the site, documenting the decades of loving philanthropy the Holt family provided for so many Korean children. So don’t wait for the perfect conditions to be in place before taking action. As Brené Brown, the author of Daring Greatly, puts it, you can waste a lot of time, talent and meaningful relationships waiting for the perfect moment. Keep this in mind: You don’t have to take a huge leap in order to get involved. Whatever it is, you can always break it down into a series of small steps instead of facing it as one massive goal. If, for instance, you’re passionate about the environment and want to launch a business redefining the way communities recycle, start by volunteering to clear trash in your neighborhood while learning more about the current recycling methods. It’s time to take action and be fearless about following your heart. The key message in these blinks: The world needs more fearless people out there, willing to go for broke in trying to help the planet and put an end to hunger and poverty once and for all. It takes fearlessness for transformative things to happen because every groundbreaking idea requires the willingness to take risks, learn from failures and to step out of comfort zones.   Actionable advice: Embrace and invest in diversity. Another way to make sure you get outside your bubble is to embrace diversity. A 2018 McKinsey report showed that businesses lacking gender and ethnic diversity underperformed compared to more diverse businesses. Plus, female-led businesses are shown to perform significantly better than male-led businesses. Yet, despite these impressive numbers, only 10 percent of investment capital goes to businesses founded by women or minorities. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "summary": "Much has been made of the tumultuousness of our times, which is all but defined by the breakneck pace of technological developments and general political unrest. However, our situation is by no means unprecedented. In fact, the Golden Age of Piracy, which began in 1690, was in many ways quite similar. Back then, many were both anxious about the uncertainties and imminent redundancies of the future and fed up with an establishment that had only its own interest at heart. Sound familiar? Throughout Europe, warfare, with all its attendant injustices, was constant. And from amid these continent-wide hostilities a network of pirates arose, a band of rebels who were fed up with the status quo and ready to pick the overflowing pockets of the governments that had long been exploiting the working class. The pirates were not the drunken thugs you may have seen depicted in movies. These were highly skilled sailors, with a well-coordinated network of collaborators, who could outmaneuver and out-strategize the best minds of the combined global superpowers of the time. Not only that, but the diverse crews that worked aboard the pirate ships were part of a democratic and progressive system that promoted a level of equality that wouldn’t be seen in Europe or the United States for hundreds of years to come. As we’ll see, there is plenty we can learn from the fascinating true story, strategy and success of the world’s greatest pirates. In these blinks, you’ll discover why pirates were among the first equal-opportunity employers; that Blackbeard was a master at branding; and how blockchain technology continues the pirate tradition. Last but not least, you’ll also find an exclusive blink crafted by the author himself, covering content not found in the book. What’s more, the author is offering the Blinkist community a 30% discount on the book itself. Just head to bemorepirate.com and enter the discount code “blinkist” to get yours. Thanks to movies like the popular Pirates of the Caribbean series, you might think that all pirates were drunken swashbucklers or murderous, scurvy-ridden thugs. Either way, it’s likely that you don’t think of pirates as politically-minded rebels fighting for justice and fair pay. Yet that’s precisely the case for many of the Golden Age pirates. Golden Age pirates sailed the high seas between 1690 and 1725, a period during which piracy thrived as it never had before. And these men and women were such innovative thinkers, rebelling against such unfair times with such progressive ideas that they still have plenty to teach us today. Specifically, there are five great attributes that Golden Age pirates should be remembered for. First is fair pay. Many pirates were former Royal Navy or Merchant Navy personnel, so they were familiar with being treated unfairly. Those in the navy were routinely paid less than promised and often much later than scheduled. In response, pirates practiced fair pay for every member of the crew. Captains and quartermasters got three to four shares of any pirated booty. Doctors and gunners got two shares. The rest of the crew got one share each. These days, the ratio between the CEO’s pay and that of the lowest-paid worker of a corporation can be as bad as 384 to 1. Meanwhile, at progressive enterprises, it can be as good as 10 to 1. But the 4-to-1 ratio that included all crew members aboard was still far fairer than anything seen today. The second amazing quality of the pirate’s life was protection against abuse of power. Navy sailors weren’t only underpaid; they also had to put up with the oppressively dictatorial ways of their commanders. So pirates, determined to keep their own captains in check, invested quartermasters with more power than they’d traditionally had. In this early example of dual governance, captains were still responsible for planning and strategizing, but the quartermaster was now in charge of keeping the crew happy and letting the captain know about any disputes. A similar two-house system of government was also catching on in England, with the 1689 Bill of Rights establishing a second house of government, which the United States would also put to use in 1776. The third of the five attributes that made Golden Age pirates a progressive and important part of history is their forward-looking approach to democracy and voting. Suffrage was extended to all shipmates, and a one-pirate, one-vote rule was established. This was another response to the harsh authoritarian rule in the navy, where corporal punishment was dished out to anyone who didn’t fall in line. The pirate’s life was one where everyone, be they man, woman, white or non-white, had a say in how things went. For the United States and the United Kingdom, it would be another 230 years or so before women were given the right to vote, in the 1920s, and another 30 years before black people got suffrage. The fourth remarkable attribute aboard pirate ships was how they handled health care and worker compensation. Pirates are often portrayed as sporting a peg leg, an eye patch and a hook for a hand, which, though cartoonish, isn’t completely inaccurate. The life of a pirate came with a certain amount of risk of injury, so, in the spirit of fairness, every crew member was given compensation for lost limbs, eyes or what have you. In the Golden Age, it was 800 pieces of eight – the popular monetary system of the time – for a leg, 600 for an arm and 100 for an eye. Also, if an injury left you unable to engage in a raid, efforts were made to find a position you could thrive in. Of course, we can’t speak of pirates without mentioning the rum. And, indeed, one of the more legendary pirates, Sir Francis Drake, is credited with being the first to mix juice and sugar into an alcoholic beverage, thus creating the world’s first cocktail – some 300 years before that mainstream mixed drink, the Old Fashioned, was invented in New York. This alcoholic innovation is attribute number five. In addition to these, there are countless other things the Golden Age pirates would deserve to be remembered for. But from these five you can already see that, far from being thuggish criminals, they were highly principled rebels who were fed up with being exploited by governments that, at the time, were colonizing and robbing other people. Next, let’s take a look at how you can put these traits to use in your own life. There are many examples of people using the pirate’s rebellious spirit to cause what’s known as “good trouble.” This is trouble that comes from noble intentions to right a wrong, put an end to injustice or simply fix an annoying problem and make the world a better place. Good trouble pushes change. Just take the digital-music pirates who paved the way for the creation of Apple’s iTunes, or the vandalism of street artist Banksy, whose work calls attention to the hypocrisy and social injustice of world governments. So the first step toward being a rebellious pirate and agent of change is to find your cause. It’s important to realize that this might take a change in your everyday attitude. Many of us prefer to shy away from confrontation. We avoid complaining or even raising our voices. But these are fears that you’ll need to overcome in order to conjure your inner pirate. To find your cause, ask yourself, “What rule do I find unfair, unjust or just plain annoying?” In the early 1960s, people in England were fed up with the limitations of BBC radio. The state-owned BBC had a stranglehold on the airwaves at the time and, for fans of the growing rock ‘n’ roll scene, there was little satisfaction in their non-rocking programming. So some industrious people launched boats into international waters and sent out their own radio signal, thus becoming the first pirate-radio DJs. This is good trouble at its best, and it prompted an overwhelmingly positive response. At its height, in 1964, it’s believed that some 15 million people were tuning in to pirate radio. And, as a result, the BBC created four new radio stations to bring listeners a more eclectic mix of programming. Of course, your rebellion doesn’t have to be so drastic as this. In fact, it might be best to start out with something small to build up your confidence. Maybe there’s a part of your job that you’re fed up with and, rather than continuing to put up with it, you could start making improvements. We’ll expand on this approach in the next blink. The Golden Age pirates didn’t just break the rules for the sake of raising hell. They were fighting back against injustice, and by offering a fair and equal workplace, they were showing that it’s possible to operate in a better way. This intention for constructive evolution is what separates true agents of change from your average scoundrels and hooligans. This is why, after identifying your cause, you should begin to formulate a replacement or new way of doing things. In other words, once you break the rule, you’ve got to rewrite it. In pirate terms, this is what a mutiny is all about. You don’t overthrow the captain without having a better captain ready to take over. One of the biggest pirates currently at sea is Elon Musk, a man who’s not only called for change in the fields of energy production and transportation but also invested his own money into improved technology and alternative fuel sources. Whether it’s the Tesla electric car, Solar City energy or the Hyperloop, a project aimed at getting people to and from Los Angeles and San Francisco in a matter of minutes, his projects all reveal his piratical instincts: to better the world by rewriting the rules. Of course, you probably don’t have a hundred million dollars to invest, so let’s look at a more everyday example with the #riotcleanup hashtag. After the 2011 London riots, the authorities were looking at the damage and scratching their collective head over what had happened. At that moment, concerned citizen Sophie Collard took to Twitter and fired off a message that ended with #riotcleanup. The message was then retweeted until it was picked up by Dan Thompson, the head of a social initiative with experience rallying people together for good causes. Soon enough, thousands of people were on the streets picking up the broken glass. Collard saw a problem and, rather than just shrugging and accepting it as the way things were, she ended up empowering thousands of people with less than 140 characters. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how pirates make the most out of limited resources. At times during the Golden Age of piracy, the Royal Navy was around 45,000 strong, while there were a mere 1,500 pirates. Nevertheless, the pirates had something the military didn’t: agility and flexibility. When looking at the establishment, no matter what era or century it is, you’ll likely find dogmatic institutions that are weighed down with bureaucracy and a very rigid power structure. And this is something any pirate should be careful to avoid. According to Belgian author and politician, Frederic Laloux, growth for growth’s sake is basically cancer. And it’s how we’ve arrived where we are today, with most consumer goods being produced by ten different megacorporations, including Coke, Pepsi and Mars – organizations that aren’t exactly famous for putting the environment and employee welfare before company profit. This applies to some of the problematic trends in digital businesses, too. One of Facebook’s mottos is, “Move fast and break things.” For Google, it’s “10X Everything.” But, these days, their size and the appetite required to maintain it are starting to make them look bloated and greedy. While many companies will blindly go after any growth they can attain, pirates appreciate the strength of making strong connections and the flexibility and adaptability that come with achieving scale. This way, they can stay small and agile, and, when the situation calls for it, they can tap into their network to scale in a sustainable way. One of the most famous pirates was Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. He had an average crew size of around 80 people, but all he needed to do was put the call out to the pirate network, and he could scale up to hundreds of people in order to conduct a big raid, like he did when he held the entire town of Charleston, South Carolina, hostage for a week. These days, pirates know that the internet has made it easier than ever to scale up or down and bring people together to solve whatever problem there is. One of the best examples is Avaaz, an online activist group run by a small and diverse crew. Despite its unassuming size, it has around 44 million users worldwide. These users can be called upon to help free journalists, protect endangered species or organize a three-mile-long handshake with the Dalai Lama. After you’ve identified your cause, rewritten the rules and organized your diverse crew, you should be on your way to facilitating change. Now the challenge is to protect and maintain that change and to avoid being corrupted yourself. When you find some success through your rebellious ways, it’s natural for the establishment, or the very institutions you’re rebelling against, to come calling and try to make you an offer. But a true pirate will maintain their integrity and avoid getting blown off course. They’ll do this by distributing the power throughout the crew and having strong principles in place to stay afloat. Pirate ships did this through the dual-leadership structure and established egalitarian rules, such as keeping the wage gap low and always giving the crew a democratic voice. It’s clear that fair pay and power-sharing are appealing to people today. Both Bernie Sanders in the United States and Jeremy Corbyn in Britain have shown that politics can be exciting to young voters when the candidate is considered to be honest and appears to authentically support progress and social change. Barry Salzberg, the CEO of the consultancy firm Deloitte, notes that, in large part because of millennials, social enterprises are coming to represent an ever-greater part of world business. These are companies that make social and environmental issues central to their mission statement. And, according to the 2017 UK State of Social Enterprise Report, these eco- and social-friendly businesses are better innovators and better performers, as well as more diverse and better paying. So, in many ways, social enterprises are today’s pirate ships, innovating at the edges and acting as predictors of future trends. A particularly impressive one is Elvis & Kresse, whose founder, Kresse Wessling, has made a hugely successful business by repurposing products that were destined for the landfill, such as broken fire hoses and parachutes, and turning them into handbags, belts and other fashion items, some of which have been featured on the cover of Vogue magazine. Furthermore, profits are finding their way back to the community: 50 percent of the profits from fire-hose bags go to the Fire Fighters Charity, for instance. At this stage in your pirate career, you’re challenging the status quo and maintaining your principles by aligning yourself with a cause that’s empowering and beneficial to society. You’ve made it this far, so now’s the time to make sure everyone knows about your message by establishing a strong brand. Pirates were also ahead of their time in their effective use of branding and storytelling. For starters, there was the Jolly Rodger; the flag pirates would fly to announce themselves. These flags were usually black and filled with fear-inducing imagery, like the classic skull and crossbones. Somewhat surprisingly, pirates were all about nurturing a frightening brand because they didn’t want to engage in violence. This was for piratically practical reasons: they didn’t want to lose crew members or have to pay someone for a lost limb. The path of least resistance was to exaggerate and come up with wild stories of just how vicious they were to all crews that didn’t immediately hand over their treasure. Pirates also knew that the most effective way to do this was to advertise their message by showing just how fearless they were. And they’d do this by charging right into the lion’s den – that is, they’d directly challenge any enemy while projecting utter confidence, even if they're truly frightened and thinking “shiver me timbers.” For example, when Blackbeard engaged the enemy, he always went the extra mile with his wild brand. Not only was he armed to the teeth with guns and swords; he’d tie bits of smoking sulfur to his beard, making him seem more like a mythical beast than a human. But the truth is that Blackbeard wasn’t the richest, most successful or most violent pirate. His name is still known all these years later, however, because he was brilliant at branding. Therefore, the three rules we can learn from pirates like Blackbeard are these: Create a singular message and make sure people notice. Be the brand – don’t just talk about it. And, finally, taking your story to the lion’s den, to critics or counter-intuitive audiences, usually creates greater waves than you could make on your own. If you’re familiar with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, you’ve probably heard about the pirate code. This isn’t a fictional concept, but, contrary to what the character of Captain Barbossa says in the movie, it’s not just a set of guidelines. They were strict rules that came with punishments if broken. If you’ve followed all the steps so far, you should already have a sense of the kind of rules that will help you stay on course, with your ship pointed toward its north star. However, while your code should reflect you and your personal values, and be designed to keep you and your crew honest, that doesn’t mean you can’t steal codes that have already proven to be helpful to others. In fact, stealing someone else’s code would just be, well, being a bit more pirate. The author has scanned today’s business landscape and offers a series of modern, successful codes that have already proven their worth and effectiveness. For example, there are groups like responsive.org that are actively looking for new ways of devising modern business plans and manifestos, rather than kicking around old business ideas from 30, 40 or 100 years ago. One particularly exciting, modern idea is the New Citizenship Project, which is about ditching the old method of creating with “consumers” in mind, and instead creating products and services for “citizens” of the world. So one of the proposed codes in the author’s Pirate Code 2.0 is to “Change the way you think about customers. They are not consumers; they are citizens like you and me.” Now, a code is only effective if it’s strictly enforced. And while you may not be a naturally forceful taskmaster, there must be consequences for crew members who break the code. This doesn’t have to mean anything as drastic as actually making them walk the plank, but it does have to include a degree of discomfort. One of the most popular punishments to arise from the workshops the author runs is for the transgressor to buy the rest of the team’s coffee for a week. With clear accountabilities in place, what a good pirate code can do is provide a concrete list that reflects who you are, what you care about and the positive change you’re trying to bring about. Becoming a pirate shouldn’t be about becoming someone else; it should be about committing yourself to the things that matter most. This is an exclusive Blink, covering content that’s not in the original book, but created by the author and Blinkist because we pirates believe in doing things a little differently now and then. If pirates are the perfect metaphor for the change-agents that the world needs, then the purpose of this blink is to see who holds the current pirate crown. Pirates kick at the edges to influence the center, and, in the author’s opinion, the defining pirate of the times is blockchain technology, which is causing waves comparable only to the arrival of the internet. To give an example of how the blockchain fulfills the pirate principles, we can look at Bitcoin and the rise of cryptocurrency: an alternative financial system built on the blockchain, where power is redistributed away from institutions and toward its users via an immutable ledger book of every transaction ever made. For some, it represents the arrival of honesty and fairness to the financial sector. For others, cryptocurrency is nothing but overblown hype. What few people see is the story behind the headlines: Bitcoin has the pirate spirit of rebellion in its DNA, literally. In 2009, mere weeks after the peak of the global financial crisis, Bitcoin was launched by a fictitious character with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Hardcoded into the “Genesis Block,” the source code for all subsequent Bitcoins, is the front page of the Times Newspaper, announcing the bailout of the banks. Shortly after this warning shot, Satoshi disappeared, laying out his philosophy in a white paper and ensuring the legacy of these disruptive shots fired at the global financial institutions. Nearly a decade later, most major banks, institutions, businesses and governments are still running to catch up with the disruption caused by that act. Breaking and remaking rules, fighting for fairness and reorganizing how things are done – the blockchain fits every element of the pirate framework for change and is now being applied in a wide range of industries from media buying to manufacturing. For example, TRUTH, the world’s first blockchain media agency, is poised to remove lack of transparency around fees in media buying, a potentially game-changing move. But whether it’s media and advertising, politics or car production, Blockchain is being applied wherever it can provide rigorous accountability in a supply chain, enabling solid auditing and the rooting out of corruption. And in true pirate spirit, this radical idea once forged at the edges is now becoming a principle adopted by the mainstream. The key message in these blinks: There are a great many lessons we can learn from the Golden Age pirates who stood up to the exploitative, war-mongering establishment at the turn of the eighteenth century. In fact, so many of their methods and principles were ahead of their time that they’re still relevant today. By taking their lead, you can become a powerful agent of change and social justice. It all starts by finding your cause, rewriting the broken rules, empowering your crew and taking your message straight into the lion’s den. Actionable advice: Ask yourself the right questions. Each step of the way to adopting the pirate mind-set, there are questions you can ask yourself. For example, when finding your cause, ask, “If I could break any rule, what would it be, and how would I rewrite it?” And, “Who out there would I most like to take down?” While bringing together your crew, plotting your mutiny and writing your pirate code, ask, “What, values or ideals am I willing to put my neck on the line for? What principles do I care about so much that I’d actually fight for them?” Don’t forget: The author has helped create this book-in-blinks, including the exclusive final blink.

    "title": "Be Obsessed or Be Average",
    "author": "Grant Cardone",
    "summary": "Many of us grew up with the impression that our reward for years of hard work and loyalty would be a nice retirement package that allows us to while away our golden years in a peaceful slumber. In this scenario, the most exciting moments are likely to involve games of bingo. But it doesn’t have to be this way. The only thing that’s preventing your wildest dreams from coming true is fear of failure or rejection – and a lack of ambition. But once you begin to tap into the great powers and passion that come with obsession, you can use your fears to your advantage. Then you’ll be on your way to unlocking the limitless rewards that come with grand ambitions. In these blinks, you’ll discover J.K. Rowling’s secret for success; what the New England Patriots can teach you about ambition; and why haters are a sign of good fortune. Every once in a while there comes a time when you’re on the job and feeling depleted of energy. When you’re on the verge of burnout, you have two options: you can either take some time off or become obsessed. The average person will likely take the first option, but this isn’t going to help you get where you want to go. If you want to reach the next level you need to get obsessed and always push toward your goals. When this happens, you’ll find that you’re generating energy, not depleting it. However, if you do feel exhausted, check in with yourself and reaffirm your purpose. Maybe you’ve gotten off track? When the author hit 40, he began feeling tired and stressed. He realized he was constantly crisscrossing the United States to give one talk after another. On days when there was a US holiday, he’d book a talk in Canada, and it wasn’t unusual for him to wake up and not know which city he was in. It dawned on Cardone that all the travel and speaking engagements had distracted him from his real obsession. He didn’t start out to be a public speaker; he wanted to be the greatest salesman on earth. After writing down his purpose and reasserting his goals in life, he immediately felt rejuvenated. Many people think that being obsessed leads to an imbalanced life, but the author has found that obsession is the key to both unlocking your energy and achieving real balance. A balanced life isn’t about taking lots of time off to relax and hang out. It’s about having the career and money you desire as well as good health, a happy family life and strong faith. And for this, you need to work hard each and every moment, which means you need the passion that comes with obsession. With this energy, you can make the most of every second, like combining family time with fitness and taking the kids to the gym with you in the morning, something the author likes to do. Let’s say you know what you’re passionate about, but it took you a lot less time than expected to reach the goals you set for yourself. In this case, the question isn’t about getting started, but about keeping going and resisting the urge to spend each day kicking back in your hammock. And this is also where obsession comes in handy. An exceptional career isn’t one that is satisfied by achieving one goal and calling it quits; instead, it involves a whole series of goals, each more audacious than the last. Having a passionate obsession means you’re not one of those people whose goal is to retire so they’ll have plenty of time for playing golf. Your goals need to be grand, driving you toward a limitless future. This is a purpose that you feel is part of your very being and makes you excited to get out of bed each morning. For example, at one point, the author owned 100 apartments, and then his goal immediately became more ambitious: to own 500. Now, as of 2016, he owns 4,500 units. Once you earn a million dollars, why not set a new goal of a billion? Start thinking of all the charitable organizations you could fund and the safety net you could provide for future generations. With endless ambitions, you can give every day the fuel that will carry you to a truly exceptional life. Now, if you imagine your post-retirement life on a golf course, your goal might be to achieve that low handicap, but then what? Before long you might end up spending the majority of the day watching TV, and then depression sets in. If you don’t want to be miserable, you need to give yourself a grand purpose that will grow along with your career. So never settle. Stay active and keep reaching for new heights. No one can predict exactly how things are going to work out. Even billionaires don’t know exactly how they're going to make their fortune. Instead, they do what you should do, which is promise ten times more than they think is possible and then force themselves and their team to find a way to deliver on that promise. So it’s important to always aim high and make promises that will make you rise to the challenge. All the major events in your life, like getting married, having a child or starting your first business require you to dive in and figure out how to swim as you go. The same principle should hold true for the goals you set for yourself and your business. You can even release products before they’re ready, especially if it means being the first on the market. Often being first is more important than being perfect, as Apple has proven time and again. Nearly every Apple product has had its fair share of flaws, but the company knows that being big, bold and innovative is more important than being delayed in beta testing. This is why Apple is considered one of the best brands ever. Another organization you should take cues from is the New England Patriots football team. When Robert Kraft took over as owner of the Patriots in 1995, they were struggling. But that didn’t stop Kraft from making bold promises to win the Super Bowl. This inspired the players to give 110 percent each season and each game, and now they’ve won five Super Bowls since Kraft came on board. Not only that, the Patriots franchise is worth $3.2 billion, and some of the best seats sell for $500 and corporate boxes for $500,000. Just like the players, the fans are inspired to believe their team is going to go far every year. As these examples show, it’s good business practice to promise the moon and have the confidence that a plan will fall into place. While pushing the envelope can be a driving force for success, it is also guaranteed to create some fear. But don’t let this stop you. Fear needs to be understood and embraced since it goes hand in hand with success. Fear comes in two main flavors: fear of rejection and fear of failure, and both must be dealt with if you want to succeed. In 2008, J.K. Rowling addressed the graduating class at Harvard University. She said what makes you great in life is being brave enough to fail. So if you never fail, you will never live. Rowling speaks from experience. She received 12 rejection letters before the first Harry Potter book was finally accepted by a publisher. And it went on to sell around twelve million copies. If she had let the fear of failure stop her, Harry Potter might not exist today, which is unthinkable! So go ahead and let yourself feel afraid, and know that it’s OK because it means you’re pushing yourself and moving forward. If you don’t feel fear from time to time, it might mean you’re getting comfortable and becoming a big fish in a small pond, which should be avoided since it means you’re not growing. If you feel you’re stagnating, it might mean you need to move to a bigger pond. Perhaps it’s time to open a new branch in another city or explore new business partnerships that will expose you to a new market? When it comes to beating the competition, fear can also be useful. Embracing fear is all about having the right mind-set, and it’s one that can give you a psychological advantage. For the author, the biggest breakthrough came following the 2008 economic collapse. At the time, everyone was scared about the future, so he decided to use this fear as an incentive to be more aggressive in making sales and more public appearances. So, while others were running scared, he began to expand into more markets, which paid off rather nicely. Whatever your fears may be, success is always going to be measured in growth. This means the smart thing to do is to put your profits and excess energy into expansion. With this strategy, you’ll have the best chance of cornering the market. This strategy also means you should view spending as much more important than saving. Think of it this way: Money that isn’t being used isn’t very useful, is it? The only money that matters is money that is helping you grow. This also makes good tax sense. While profits are always taxed, money that’s re-invested in your company is usually not taxed, making these dollars more valuable at the end of the day. So it’s wise to always be on the lookout for growth and investment opportunities, including new markets to expand into and new avenues to explore. The author recommends spending 30 to 40 percent of your profits on expansion opportunities. But if those expansion opportunities are proving hard to find, then the next best thing is to spend that money on publicity. Generally speaking, money spent on marketing, advertising and social media is never wasted. When publicity works and you become a household name, those previously elusive expansion opportunities will soon be knocking at your door. Whatever you do, don't try to be a “one-man show.” Being a leader means guiding your team to success, and often this means having a very big team, such as Amazon’s staff of over 200,000, or Apple and Microsoft, with their 100,000-strong teams. Currently, around 75 percent of US companies are what the author would call a one-man show, and when you average out their annual profit, it’s a meager $44,000. The author learned the limits of this approach the hard way, spending ten years trying to do it all himself until he realized that being in charge means knowing how to delegate and hire people who help you earn money. That’s when Cardone started employing a lot of people, and the company really began to grow. With great success comes opposition. It’s just the way business works. But since you can anticipate competitors and critics you can also prepare yourself. Today’s social media landscape offers haters plenty of avenues to pick on you, but the best way to deal with their presence isn’t to try and shut them up – it’s to be thankful for the attention. Think of it this way: the more haters you have, the more successful you are. There’s an old saying that “there’s no such thing as bad publicity,” and in this case, haters can indeed be used as free publicity. When someone criticises you, they see you as a leading force in the market. No one picks on an insignificant business. Only those who are important are seen as worthy of trolls and vehement criticism. To put it another way: If you have millions of Twitter users hating on you, there’s a chance you could become the next president! Haters also have the added benefit of making us more resilient. Think back to all those bullies over the years. For better or worse, they did play a role in making you the person you are today. Whether it was the jocks or mean girls who picked on you in high school, the bank manager who didn’t approve your loan, or the anonymous troll who’s calling you a capitalist pig, they might be a pain in the ass but they can also help you to form a thicker skin and fuel your passion to prove them wrong. If used wisely, the words of haters can even result in you making some adjustments and creating a better product. However, it’s not just haters that can stand between you and your obsession. Sometimes, members of your own team can be the ones holding you back, and in the next blink, we’ll look at how best to manage problematic employees and create a company-wide culture of obsession. Which would you consider more important for generating profits, being nice or being effective? Hopefully, you chose the second option since it’s a fact of business that, from time to time, you need to make unpopular decisions in order to maintain leadership and ensure that everyone is staying on track. The best way to maintain control of your staff and business is to control the conversation – literally. Everyone on your team should be aware that you are both listening and observing them at all times. This means listening in on their sales calls to make sure your team is as aggressive and passionate about moving product as you would be if you were making the calls yourself. If someone isn’t up to your standards, or if the client isn’t properly advised, it’s perfectly acceptable to enter the conversation and set things straight. There are other ways to make your team aware that you recognize good work and are personally engaged in every aspect of the business. The author makes a habit of sending personal messages of gratitude to the individual workers who put all their effort into their work. Even if he’s thousands of miles from the office, he’ll record a video on his phone and send it to the team. Honest, personal touches like this will ensure total commitment. But your control really starts by being ruthless when it comes to hiring and firing. Remember, when you hire someone an agreement is made: you pay them and treat them fairly, while they perform a certain standard of work. So, when an employee fails to hold up their part of the deal and becomes dead weight, you shouldn’t feel bad about letting them go and replacing them with someone who will do the job. These days we no longer expect to work the same job for 50 years. Most people expect to have several full-time jobs over the course of their career. Millennials are especially aware of how to take advantage of short-term contracts in order to build a varied career. It’s your job to build a team that is as obsessive and passionate about your business as you are. With this in place, success is sure to follow. The key message in this book: Being exceptional means having a growth mind-set. To truly succeed, you need to set high expectations for yourself and your company that may seem impossible. But these big goals are key to motivating a tireless workforce and propelling you toward truly exceptional results. Actionable advice: Don't waste time on tasks that aren’t fuelling your obsession. Don't let household chores eat into valuable time which would be better spent pursuing your dreams. Don’t hesitate to pay someone else to clean your car, mow your lawn or vacuum your apartment. Surely there are more important things that both suit your skill set and move your plans forward. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Behind the Cloud",
    "author": "Marc R. Benioff and Carlye Adler",
    "summary": "Every year millions of companies are started around the world. The majority fail within a few years. Multi-billion-dollar powerhouse Salesforce.com is truly one of the exceptions. So what makes them different? All success stories begin with an idea you truly believe in and the courage to go your own way when venture capitalists give you the cold shoulder and markets are in uproar. But how do you give that fledgling idea wings? By clearly differentiating yourself from others, putting the customer at the heart of your business, and by not being afraid to pick on the big dogs, you can not only pave the way to success, you can also change an entire industry. In these blinks you’ll learn how Salesforce.com put an end to the software era; why standing out from the crowd is so important; and how you become big in Japan. Even the biggest companies in the world start off as mere ideas. But if everyone could snap their fingers and manifest those ideas, the world would be teeming with entrepreneurs. So what is it that made Marc Benioff and Salesforce.com so massively successful? Let’s start with this tip from Benioff: when you notice an idea’s potential, don’t be intimidated by it, even if it means going at it alone. The idea for Salesforce.com wasn’t the culmination of an arduous journey to seek out a grand new business concept. Benioff was on sabbatical after over ten years as vice president of Oracle when he got his inspiration while swimming with dolphins in Hawaii. Around this time, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) company Siebel Systems went public with a software solution that enabled salespeople to track leads, account information and manage contacts. However, it was expensive, flawed and high-maintenance, like many other similar solutions at the time. Benioff noted the concept and thought he could improve the software using a “Software-as-a-Service” approach, specifically through a cloud computing model, so he contacted founder Tom Siebel about his idea. However, although supportive, Siebel didn’t think it would win over a significant part of the market. But Benioff stuck to his vision and decided to go at it alone. He knew he had to think big. To draw in the best engineers for his new company, he marketed his vision as “the end of software business and technology models.” He knew that this benchmark would intrigue any skilled developer. By March 1999, he had employed three highly experienced application developers who worked with him in a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco and by that summer, Benioff had ten employees and was out-growing the apartment. To accommodate his promising company, he decided to rent an 8,000 square-foot office space at the Rincon Center. Marketing: it’s the number one way to garner attention when you’re still a growing company. If you want to see the same kind of success as Salesforce.com, you must assert yourself either against the market leader or as the new market leader from the very start. The first thing you must figure out is how you can show the public that you are unique. Just six months after Benioff founded Salesforce.com, Don Clark from the Wall Street Journal wrote a front page story on the “spawning of a new industry.” This did wonders for the company and spread awareness about the “end of software” era. Benioff knew he had to offer a clear message and inform journalists about how Salesforce.com was different from other companies. Next, Salesforce.com needed branding. And for this, Benioff hired Bruce Campbell, a legendary marketer who created the “no software” logo, which consisted of the word “software” in a red circle with a line through it. Some team members were skeptical, but Benioff felt that their concerns were overruled by the number one marketing rule – stand out from the pack. He was right: after plastering the logo all over magazines and newspapers, the campaign was recognized as the Hi-Tech Campaign of the Year by PRWeek. But it’s not enough to simply stand out from the crowd, you must also pick a fight with the biggest players. Bolstered by the positive media feedback, Salesforce.com began badgering their competitors. In one instance, they paid actors to pretend to be protesters waving “no software” signs in front of a conference for their main competitor, Siebel User Group. Every visitor was given an invitation for the Salesforce.com launch party and many of them showed up! The press revelled in this David and Goliath story, adding even more buzz to the event. As Salesforce.com expanded, they found it less necessary to concentrate on attacking their competitors. Now was the right time to really market the value of their service. One of the best ways to do exactly this is to use events wisely to maximize the viral effect. There are two important marketing strategies that result in the best sales conversions: the first are editorials, which are unbiased write-ups in the press. The second are testimonies, meaning word-of-mouth created by customers enthusing about their success stories. Rather than presenting their product to potential investors, Salesforce.com started organizing a road show in a string of cities called City Tours, with events featuring keynote speakers, customer presentations and demos. This brought potential customers, journalists and analysts together to share their experiences. This way of catering to the end user made a marked difference in the company’s marketing success. Traditional software companies chased executives who, although they controlled budgets, were less likely to use the product themselves. So Salesforce.com saw more value in celebrating their real customers. They covered events with posters of them, even incorporating them into their presentations. These events became affectionately known as “love fests,” and enabled the company to close deals with a huge 80 percent of new prospects. Lastly, the company began throwing cocktail parties instead of hosting boring product demos. As the City Tours became more popular, Benioff wasn’t convinced they could keep holding such expensive events in every city. But an East Coast salesman had an idea: he didn’t really care about the presentations, but loved the after parties, where he could mingle with customers. So how about just hosting the cocktail parties? Salesforce.com decided to test this in a small venue in New York with only 11 customers and prospects. At a tenth of the cost of a typical City Tour event, the net result was almost exactly the same. Dealing in enterprise software during the 1990s meant tailored presentations, multiple negotiations and months of expensive work. But as the internet era dawned, Salesforce.com found a far better way to deliver and improve their product: they recognized that the customers themselves should be able to evaluate it. Benioff understood that potential customers wanted to be hands-on with the software before they signed anything. So he started giving away free trials over the internet, which meant customers could try it without talking to a salesperson. This isn’t unusual today, but in 1999 it certainly wasn’t standard industry practice. The software initially cost $50 per month, so the purchase was also less risky for the customer. Salesforce.com also created “bugforce,” a scaled-down database where customers could report bugs and offer new ideas for the software. With this constant feedback from customers, they were able to rework and refine the software immediately, and respond to customers’ needs effectively. This customer-centric approach helped them more than they could have predicted when the dot-com bubble burst. The dot-com craze initially boosted a lot of sites. But in March 2001, they, as well as Salesforce.com, were hit hard. Many companies decided to leave Salesforce.com and by October 2001, the company was losing up to one and a half million dollars per month, creating critical cash flow problems. Their solution was to change from a monthly to a yearly billing plan. Although this was a more conservative approach and restricted the customers’ payment plans, over 50 percent of them agreed to it immediately. Within a year, Salesforce.com went from being in the red to making a profit, all while retaining many of their customers. This was only possible because they had earned the trust and loyalty of their customers long beforehand, and the same customers now felt secure about paying upfront. Software companies such as Oracle traditionally tailored their products for each company that used their product. But Salesforce.com focused on a single service to suit everyone. They did this partly by allowing their users to share their service over the internet. The developers at Salesforce.com used a technology model they called “multitenancy.” This acted like an apartment building where tenants split costs associated with the whole building, but every tenant still had their own lock and could decorate their apartment however they liked. At Salesforce.com, this meant the user could access the software running on the Salesforce.com servers while still working with their own data. Venture capitalists saw this as a loss of control and feared they would shed customers as a result. But this was never a problem – maintenance became easier because every user received updates or new features automatically. Besides, if they went back on the idea, how could they promote “the end of software” if they began offering exactly what they wanted to destroy? In addition to multitenancy, Salesforce.com knew they had to make things fast and simple. Before their small-scale development team started writing the code, they created core principles for the system and laid them out on a whiteboard. They concluded that the system should be fast, because salespeople needed information quickly, and if they ran into roadblocks, they would quit the service. Next, they decided their code should be as simple as possible, which would make identifying and fixing bugs easier. Their principles paid off: in the first quarter of 2009, the service had a 99.9 percent uptime and over 200 million transactions per day. One pivotal decision was to make the code public for external developers, giving them free rein to create their own applications. This was put to use by the $300-million healthcare services provider, the Schumacher Group, who used it for over 90 percent of their operational programs. Salesforce.com had now laid a solid foundation in the United States, but as the need for CRM was international, Marc Benioff was keen to expand overseas. So what should you do if you want to be internationally competitive? Choose your headquarters wisely. Salesforce.com opted for Europe first, and in order to give themselves a promising start, in 2000, they set up their headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. At this time Dublin was attractive to big companies like Oracle or Microsoft, due to the English-speaking population and the favorable tax rate of 12.5 percent. They also resolved to only hire native speakers from different countries. That way, when a customer from Germany called they would think they were speaking with someone in Germany. Although they had an office for essential office work, they conducted meetings largely from luxury hotels in London, which was possible as their software was internet-based. Using hotels for meetings projected an image of success to their clients, and it was cheaper than renting high-end offices. The company also began to tailor their marketing strategy for different markets. Salesforce’s aggressive marketing strategy was hugely effective in the United States and Europe, so now they set their sights on Asian markets, beginning with Japan. After conducting a bit of research, they recognized that they would need to approach Japan rather differently, with a significant re-think on how they positioned themselves. Japanese companies are traditionally cautious about foreign products, and look for something relatable. Salesforce.com learned this lesson from their direct sales manager, Eiji Uda. Everytime he introduced Salesforce.com to potential Japanese customers, he would throw in a few references to other growing companies like Google or Amazon, with which the Japanese were familiar. Then, when two of the biggest Japanese companies – Canon and Japan Post – started implementing Salesforce.com into their workflow, many more were happy to follow suit. Getting sufficient funds together is one of the most stressful and draining parts of setting up a business. Unfortunately, even if you’re a passionate entrepreneur, the passion alone is not enough to support your new business financially. Thankfully, though, start-up capital is often closer at hand than you might think. According to one study, 79 percent of small businesses start out with a serious lack of funds. In an attempt to avoid being one of these companies, Benioff sought out interested venture capitalists. This seemed logical for a fast-growing internet company looking to land a multi-million-dollar investment. However, no one was particularly enthused by the “no software“ model. But rather than quitting, Benioff reminded himself of all the other companies, like Starbucks and Cisco, that got turned down by venture capitalists. So Benioff went to those who believed in him: his family and friends. To his surprise, he found many people in his immediate circle who totally backed his idea. Remarkably, over five fundraising rounds he managed to raise $65 million between 1999 and 2002, much to the chagrin of the venture capitalists who had rejected his idea. If they’d made an initial investment of $1 million it would be worth one hundred times that today. Benioff also decided to focus his efforts on raising revenue and expanding Salesforce.com’s customer base, rather than streamlining the firm and chasing profitability. In 2002, Salesforce.com had the goal of becoming a one billion-dollar company, and they decided to go public. However, as the market had only just found its feet after the dot-com bubble burst, companies now had to demonstrate significant revenue. Going against convention, Salesforce.com started to audit before they went public. By December 2003, after over a year of internal preparation, Salesforce.com increased their annual revenue from $25 million to $100 million. That’s more than twice as much as other companies had achieved. Not long after, on 23 June 2004, Benioff got to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange – a personal career highlight. The key message in this book: Salesforce.com is a solid example of a company who became hugely successful by following a few key guidelines: stand by your vision; know how to position yourself in different markets; keep your customers at the center of your business; pick one product or service and do it in the best possible way; and don’t be scared of the big players. Actionable advice: Don’t let expense stop you. If you have an idea you believe in, don’t let anyone dissuade you with stories of how hard it will be to raise the money to realize it. Instead of chasing down venture capitalists, look to other means to support your idea, like people you know or institutions and organizations that can back you financially.

    "title": "Better and Faster",
    "author": "Jeremy Gutsche",
    "summary": "A few thousand years ago, humanity made a bold decision. People stopped being hunters and started being farmers. Most decided that a life of relative comfort and predictability was better than one of risk and constant movement. You might think they made a wise move, but in fact this change led to humanity’s becoming lazier and more complacent, something that affects us to this day. How? Well take a look at any business industry, and you’ll find leaders who embody farmer mentality: people too indifferent, scared or set in their ways to change. More often than not, these people fail. There are others, however, who’ve clung to the life of the hunter; they’re quick to act, ready to be brutal and never scared to take risks. These are the people you ought to emulate. These blinks tell you all you need to know about becoming a hunter, allowing you to succeed in today’s constantly changing world. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Red Bull is a success in spite of its taste; how Volvo uses a car’s ugliness to sell it; and how Blockbuster went from the top to bankrupt in no time. Every business leader thinks they have what it takes to succeed. They’re smart enough to know what needs to be done and tenacious enough to overcome any obstacle that stands in their way. Nonetheless, failure in business is as common as dirt. And that’s because the people at the top – especially those in fast-changing industries – frequently fall into one of the three so-called farmer traps. Farmer trap #1 refers to complacency, which develops when people rest on the laurels earned from past successes. As an example, look at typewriter manufacturer Smith Corona, a former industry giant who became complacent and failed to adapt to the changing marketplace. In 1990, the company pulled out of a joint venture with computer giant Acer, because they believed their business was too strong to be vulnerable to market change. Three years later, Smith Corona declared bankruptcy; they’d been crushed by the emerging computer sector. Similarly, farmer trap #2 occurs when you repeat actions that brought success in the past and expect the same outcome in the present. Blockbuster Video is the perfect example of a business that crumbled because it fell into the Farmer Trap of repetition: in 2009, the franchise boasted 9,000 locations and 60,000 employees. But just a year later, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy: the company had failed to adapt to the streaming market, continuing to direct almost all their resources into franchising and physical media. Finally, farmer trap #3 describes a state of protectiveness. This occurs when companies set up barriers that protect the status quo and inhibit evolution. For instance, film manufacturer Kodak missed some wonderful opportunities because they were overly protective of their elite status in the analog film market. But that was a big mistake: the company’s unwillingness to invest resources into digital innovation led them to declare bankruptcy in 2012. As we’ve learned, it’s easy to fall into one of the farmer traps. But luckily, it’s also possible to avoid them by cultivating the three hunter instincts. First, don’t be complacent; instead, be insatiable. Because insatiability – constantly scanning the horizon for the next opportunity – is the core of hunter instinct #1. Capital One Bank is a great example of a company driven by this instinct. After the 2008 financial crisis, the bank poured their resources into innovation and experimentation. As a result, they soon boasted a billion-dollar portfolio of low-risk assets. In other words, by focusing on innovation, the bank successfully adapted to the marketplace; meanwhile, most of its competitors suffered a credit crunch. Moving on: hunter instinct #2 rejects repetitiveness in favor of curiosity – the drive to seek out new and fresh sources of inspiration. How else will you spot new trends and develop your next business success? After all, innovation happens when people take creative mental leaps, connecting fields in ways others couldn’t have imagined. And to make those kinds of connections, you have to be curious. Take entrepreneur Ron Finley as a prime example of this principle. For Finley, his Los Angeles neighborhood was a source of inspiration, leading him to success in a variety of fields, from fashion to urban gardening to social outreach. Finally, hunter instinct #3 reminds us that we need to have a willingness to destroy. Instead of being overprotective and cautious, you have to be ready to abandon your safety net if you want to encounter new ideas and opportunities. In fact, the willingness to destroy is precisely what explains chef Eric Ripert’s decades-long success. He’s been able to sustain the coveted three-star Michelin rating for years and years, despite the fact that he constantly throws out old menus and starts again from scratch, fully embracing the new. So now that we know how to awaken our hunter instincts, it’s time to learn how to put them into practice. And that’s what the next blinks are all about. It’s time to put your hunter instincts into practice: there are six scenarios, or patterns of opportunity, that will allow you to spot new business models and products, giving you a serious competitive edge. Let’s start with two of these patterns: convergence and divergence. The former, convergence, is about taking advantage of market chaos to create opportunity by mixing and integrating the right trends. After all, you can create a winning idea by combining multiple services and products. For instance, the successful iPhone fitness and running app, “Zombies, Run!,” employs convergence by combining three things: GPS technology, the lucrative fitness market and the highly popular zombie trend. As you can see, combining several appealing patterns and industries is a great way of providing value to customers. The second pattern, divergence, takes a different approach by carving out a competitive advantage through a unique perspective that diverges from the overcrowded mainstream. Designing a product that taps into compelling alternative notions like rebellion, status or luxury will allow you to stand out from the crowd. The key to successfully pulling off the divergence approach is marketing; in order to stand out from the competition, you have to turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength. And that’s exactly what Red Bull did, becoming one of the most successful beverage brands, despite their less-than-palatable product. The company succeeded by using a savvy advertising strategy that communicated an exciting and unique brand. Ultimately, the company proved that with the right marketing plan, you can harness the power of divergence and create successful products and services that stand out. Let’s move on to the next two patterns of opportunity: Cyclicality and Redirection. These two approaches are all about harnessing the power of momentum, by doing things like, for instance, forecasting trends and figuring out how to take advantage of predictably recurring elements such as retro appeal, nostalgia, economic cycles and generational patterns. This point speaks directly to cyclicality, which requires you to foster a sense of history that’ll allow you to look beyond the moment and anticipate what’s next. This can be a powerful way of carving out opportunity: consider the fact that all sorts of companies – liquor companies and auto manufacturers, fashion brands and food products – have managed to reinvigorate their businesses by tapping into cyclical patterns and taking advantage of nostalgia. Just look at the success of Instagram, a product that combines nostalgia with the social media photo-sharing trend. These two simple elements are at the heart of the world-famous app, which imbues user-generated photographs with a vintage-like quality. The next pattern, redirection, aims to channel the power of a trend or behavior by refocusing, reprioritizing or reversing it. This is essentially the art of “spin” – turning a potentially negative narrative upside down, using the momentum of a trend to your own advantage and inspiring desire for your product in the process. Through well-crafted redirection, you can create an appealing positive narrative out of something more negative. Just look at Volvo: by using the slogan, “They’re boxy but they’re good,” the auto company launched a successful marketing campaign that drew attention to the car’s safety features. By playing up the security aspect, Volvo neutralized the car’s unpopular design and ultimately increased sales. Let’s learn about the two remaining patterns of opportunity: reduction and acceleration. These are both proven methods for finding a specific market, creating a winning business idea and becoming a better innovator, decision-maker and investor. Reduction involves targeting niche audiences with a product or service that stands out because of its extreme simplicity. Doing this gets to the core of a business concept by using crowdsourcing and localization to remove any unneeded parts. In other words, by identifying and then skillfully removing all the complex layers of existing products, you can create value and carve out success in a small market. And that will open up many more possibilities. As it happens, reduction explains the wild popularity of GoPro, an easy-to-use, wide-angle, two-button camera that has proven irresistible to a specific group of consumers eager to capture their adventurous exploits.   The next pattern of opportunity, acceleration, relies on the practice of perfecting, exaggerating, reimagining or repositioning key product features as a way of differentiating yourself from the competition. To do that, you have to identify a crucial feature of an existing product or business concept which you then dramatically enhance. In other words, figure out what’s great about an idea and then accelerate it; making it bigger, faster or better will engage customers. To that end, just look at Dyson: the brand established itself as the world standard for high-end vacuum cleaners after they refined the device to create the most powerful vacuum on the market. It took 5,127 prototypes to get there, but it was worth it: in 1991, James Dyson won the International Design Fair prize for his ultra-powerful and efficient product. Wake up your “inner hunter.” Familiarize yourself with the six patterns of opportunity. Done all that? Great! Now you can start narrowing your focus and zero in on a great business idea. Of course, finding the nugget of a successful idea is easier said than done. The key is to establish a “hunting ground” and identify a cluster of opportunity – some group of products, services or concepts that have a similar approach. Then, you use the six patterns of opportunity to reframe the central idea and make it special. But don’t limit your hunting ground by only researching and collecting ideas that are obviously similar. Instead, look beyond your immediate market to find clever approaches to similar goals. That’s the way to create something truly unique. For instance, instead of developing a simple pop-up store concept, use convergence to launch a “Double Business.” One artist, Karl Lagerfeld, did just that when he combined a pop-up fashion shop with an art gallery. However, no matter what industry you choose to work within, you have to be able to forecast future trends before they actually happen. Luckily, whether you’re hunting ground involves movies, fashion, tech, retail, broadcast media or food, you can use the six patterns to find future opportunities. In the fashion field, for example, retailers like Zara and H&M have reached success by providing consumers with more choice. In fact, Zara became one of the fastest-growing retailers by both speeding up their production process – they only need 14 days to get a newly-designed product into stores – and by offering thousands of different items at any given moment. But what’s next? By applying convergence to the fashion industry, we can predict the rise of trends like wearable technology, 3D printed clothing and more. And the firms that figure out how to capitalize on those trends now will be dominant in the future. The key message: Today’s marketplace is far more unpredictable and chaotic than ever before. To be successful in this turbulent environment, you must embrace change. Do so by awakening your inner hunter and exploiting patterns of opportunity. That way, you’ll be able to adapt quickly – to not only survive, but to thrive. Actionable advice: Cyclicality is one of the most persistent and prevalent patterns of opportunity. Whatever your field, you can take advantage of this pattern by following four simple takeaways.

    "title": "Big Bang Disruption",
    "author": "Larry Downes and Paul Nunes",
    "summary": "Billions of years ago, the big bang brought the universe into being. In the blink of an eye, all matter, all space-time, suddenly was. Today, businesses burst into markets as our universe once burst into the void, creating unforeseen market possibilities and decimating the markets that came before. These companies are Big Bang Disruptors. Obviously, it’s best to be one of these companies, but, if that’s not possible, it’s crucial to understand the process of Big Bang Disruption. And that’s what these blinks are all about. Learn about the four-stage life cycle of disruption, and along the way, become well-acquainted with the 12 rules of disruption survival. Whether you’re plotting a big bang of your own or just trying to figure out how not to get blown away, these blinks will help you in the ever-changing multiverse that is the modern marketplace. You’ll also find out when to seek out truth-tellers; what’s probably in store for AOL; and why it’s wise to relax about strategy. Remember paper road maps? Those awkwardly large, folded sheets that once hibernated in almost every glove compartment, waiting to be consulted by turned-around motorists? Today, these unwieldy guides, with their fold creases and crackling pages, are all but extinct. Analog roadmaps went out with a bang – the big bang that was the introduction of GPS systems to the driving public. In 2000, Garmin, a company whose sales had increased throughout the 1990s, sold three million GPS devices while the sale of paper road maps began to decrease. At the time, relatively inexpensive GPS was an example of a Big Bang Disruptor: an innovative product that’s both superior to – and, usually, more affordable than – competing products on the market. But it wasn’t long before Garmin’s devices were blasted away by another big bang. In 2009, after the advent of the smartphone, Google introduced Google Maps: A service that, because it was free and easy to update, could be improved at a pace equal to modern-day needs. From the moment it hit the market, it proved to be the best and cheapest navigational technology available – and it still is. But what made it possible for Google to oust Garmin just as Garmin had ousted analog maps? Well, Google took advantage of exponential technologies. For a technology to qualify as exponential, its performance and value must have a pattern of exponential increase – doubling, for instance, on an annual or biennial basis. Cloud-based computing – data-processing or data-storage software that runs online – is one example of an exponential technology. Equipped with such technologies, a Big Bang Disruptor can upend an established market. This is exactly what Google did. In fact, Google Maps leverages the power of cloud-based computing, as well as taking advantage of the internet and smartphones. All this means that Google is able to offer Google Maps for free. Indeed, it’s now the default app on pretty much all smartphones, which guarantees that it’s used by millions of people every day. It’s hard to imagine a bigger bang than that. If you don’t want to get obliterated by the next big bang, then you should learn how to spot disruptors before the disruption begins. Luckily, this isn’t so hard to do, as all Big Bang Disruptors have three characteristics in common. First, they use undisciplined strategy. Businesses of yore tended to limit themselves to a single “market discipline.” That is, they’d conduct a considerable amount of research and do a great deal of strategizing before bringing a product to market. If the analysis indicated that the potential product wasn’t superior to, or cheaper than, competing products, then it was a no-go. Today, exponential technologies enable Big Bang Disruptors to produce cheap and superior products, allowing them to be utterly undisciplined about which market segments they enter. Furthermore, creating a new product used to be a costly undertaking. Now, it’s considerably less expensive. Because of the declining cost of creation, bringing a new product to market and seeing whether or not it does well is often more cost-effective than conducting elaborate research. In this new environment, strategic discipline is obsolete. Big Bang Disruptors are also characterized by unconstrained growth. The internet and the social networks it’s spawned have made public a mind-boggling amount of information. In most cases, it costs nothing for consumers to access the information they’re after, nor does it cost much more for companies to make direct contact with these consumers. This phenomenon is called the declining cost of information, and it’s making exorbitant marketing campaigns as nonessential as strict strategy. After all, if you’re a disruptor, it’s likely that your customers use social media and other online platforms (Yelp, for instance). They probably share your content online – not to mention their opinion of your content. This works as free advertising that companies previously had to pay for. Why dish out big bucks to disrupt a market when it’s being disrupted for you? The third characteristic to keep an eye out for is unencumbered development. Thanks to the declining cost of experimentation, it’s both simple and inexpensive for disruptors to develop a product. Just as market research is becoming a thing of the past, product experimentation is also on the way out. For example, a modern app developer wouldn’t expend funds on elaborate experiments to see whether his app is going to work or not. He’d simply release the app, and if users identify a lot of problems, or don’t use it at all, then it’s back to the drawing board. If it seems like it might be a hit, however, he can begin to iron out any problems and refine its functions. Next up, we’ll take a look at the life cycle of a Big Bang Disruptor. We live in a cyclical world. The things that are today will, at some point, no longer be. And Big Bang Disruptors are no exception. Each Big Bang Disruption goes through a four-stage life cycle. It starts with the Singularity. In physics, a singularity is a point in space-time at which matter is infinitely dense. Our universe bloomed from such a point after the big bang released all the matter and space-time that this initial singularity contained. For Big Bang Disruptors, the Singularity is the drawn-out period that comes before they enter the market. During this period, incumbent companies may start to feel uneasy – something is in the air. In the meantime, the disruptor is developing and experimenting, getting ready for the next stage. The second stage, known as the Big Bang, is the abrupt and overpowering success of the disruptor. Just as the universe came into being in mere seconds, so the success of the disruptor is solidified almost instantaneously. The right technology combined with the right business model – and bang: a market is transformed or created, and customers come flocking. Next is the Big Crunch. After the big bang, the universe’s energy began to dissipate. After a Big Bang Disruption, a similar process of dissipation begins. Soon, the market is saturated, and the company’s value, which initially spiked tremendously, begins to even out and taper off. Then comes Entropy, the fourth stage of a Big Bang Disruption. According to the big bang theory, the universe will someday implode and collapse. But matter and energy won’t just vanish when this happens. Rather, they’ll combine with one another to take on new forms. The same thing happens at the end of a Big Bang Disruption’s life cycle. Assets, instead of disappearing, come together – presenting new opportunities for experimentation and development and leading to new Singularities. In the remaining blinks, we’ll look at each of the 12 rules you can follow to survive the blast of a Big Bang Disruption. If you sense that a company has entered the Singularity stage, your best defense against the impending market explosion is to simply play along and get ready to do some disrupting of your own. Doing this is a matter of following three rules. First off, hunt down and talk to the inquisitive individuals who’ve taken the time to gain an expert-level understanding of your industry. These people – we’ll call them truth-tellers – will be able to help you forecast how emerging technologies and cutting-edge strategies may affect the industry’s future landscape. Kevin Ashton, a British tech pioneer famous for coining the term “the Internet of Things,” is a paragon of truth-telling savvy. While working with Procter & Gamble, the consumer-products manufacturer, Ashton realized that scanner systems failed to indicate whether advertised products were actually in stock. He figured there had to be emerging technologies that could remedy this problem, and, after some research, hit upon an innovative method for establishing wireless connections between inventory networks. This, and other product management breakthroughs led to Ashton working with various start-ups and tech institutions, such as MIT, where he continued to develop his ideas. He’s precisely the sort of truth-teller you should seek to consult before market disruption begins. Rule number two is to intelligently time your entrance into an emerging market. Consider how Jeff Bezos, the cofounder and CEO of Amazon, timed the launch of the Kindle. Rather than jumping right into the e-reader market, Bezos held back, watching as other companies failed to satisfy customers with their products. He then identified the product’s shortcomings – insufficient storage or short battery life for instance – that had led to these failures. This enabled him to produce a superior product and perfectly time its release. When the Kindle hit the market in 2007, it sold out in a matter of hours, despite costing $399. Now, the third rule: conduct experiments that’ll increase your understanding of how to stay abreast of market disruptors. You might consider attending a hackathon, for instance. At these events, computer programmers and other people, usually those in the tech-industry, converge and collaborate on software-related projects. The authors attended one such event in 2013. Sponsored by AT&T, the hackathon focused on devising new ideas for smartphone apps that would assist people with autism. The event not only resulted in multiple app ideas, but it exposed the authors to mobile industry leaders. Boom. The Big Bang hits – and everything is changing, fast. Old markets are abandoned as customers are drawn to the new one like iron filings to an all-powerful magnet. You’ve survived the Singularity, and, luckily, you’re part of this new market. That means it’s time to start following the next three rules. At this point, you’ve got to start thinking about how to keep your company alive, because the other disruptors will be experiencing catastrophic success – catastrophic to your business, that is. The fourth rule is to be prepared for this. That means having everything in place: strategy, systems, inventory, human resources and anything else that seems necessary. After the Big Bang, when the orders and new customers flood in, you won’t have time to deal with such things. Consider making agreements with third parties prior to the market’s disruption. That way, you’ll have people on hand if you need to outsource work. The fifth rule is to do your best to seize winner-take-all markets. To create a winner-take-all market, and be the one who wins it, you’ve got to exploit all the information at your disposal. Today, this is easier to do than ever before. Thanks to the internet, a wealth of extremely specific information is available to you. Take Amazon as an example. The way it collects and uses information has ensured its dominance in multiple markets. Amazon not only considers reviews from customers and professionals alike; it runs all customer-activity data through an algorithm that’s specifically designed to generate customer-specific product recommendations. Rule number six is to slow the disruption down so you have time to think and respond to the torrent of whizz-bang changes. Like Neo, the bullet-dodging protagonist of the sci-fi film The Matrix, you’ve got to be able to enter your own sort of bullet time. This will help you make your own moves even as the market is being disrupted. If your company is an incumbent, you can slow down future onslaughts with patents. By laying claim to the legal rights of potentially disruptive innovations – be it a service, product or simply an idea – you’ll build a roadblock, albeit a temporary one, in the path of future disruptors. During the Big Bang, market disruptors will generate a great deal of value and profit. As one of them, you’ll be feeling pretty optimistic. But remember, even during this exciting ascent you should prepare for decline. The next stage in the disruption life cycle is never far off. When the Big Crunch begins, the disrupted market will reach saturation point, and all your inventory and capacity could become useless. To avoid this fate, follow the seventh rule: anticipate saturation. What’ll happen if you don’t? Well, here’s a cautionary tale: The Nook, an e-reader produced by Barnes & Noble, got off to an auspicious start, selling roughly 60,000 units in one year. Encouraged by this success, the bookseller continued production. But then the Big Crunch hit. Amazon released a new version of the Kindle, and a new array of e-reading apps were launched. In this saturated market, Nooks were no longer wanted. By 2013, Barnes & Noble had suffered more than $130 million in losses – all thanks to excess inventory. Rule number seven dovetails nicely with rule number eight: it’s also about anticipating decline, and it states that you should dispose of assets before they become worthless or impractical. Your assets are all the things your company possesses that aren’t your product, such as equipment and properties. If the market is on the verge of disruption, then it’s time to dispose of some of these assets before they depreciate in value and become liabilities. Nike dealt with this problem by outsourcing much of its production. Outsourcing is a great way to cut back on assets; after all, if someone is producing your product for you, then you don’t need to own a factory. This makes Nike, which has roughly 900 foreign partners, mostly in Asia, extremely lean. The ninth and final rule to follow during the Big Crunch is to get out while the getting is good. This isn’t always the ideal solution, but if you can’t compete, it’s better to cut your losses and move on – whether that means discontinuing a line of products or getting out of business entirely. Philips Lighting, the Dutch technology company, discontinued one of its best-selling light bulbs in 2006. Though it’d been profitable since 1891, the incandescent bulb was, the company knew, becoming outmoded. It produced a great deal of heat, and better products were already visible on the horizon. Even though the product’s track record was great, and more than a century long, Philips made the right choice and got out. So you made it through the Big Crunch. But now you’ve got to survive the final stage in the Big Bang Disruption life cycle: Entropy. There are three rules that’ll help you do this. The first – rule number ten – is to avoid black holes. After being disrupted, a market can soon turn into a black hole, as customers leave and take their business to the new market created by the big bang. Now, it’s possible to survive in a black hole market. A few customers will probably remain, and, if intelligently scaled, the business can stay afloat. But it’s usually only a matter of time before the market vanishes entirely. For instance, the internet-service provider America Online, or AOL, exists in a black hole market. Their remaining customers are mostly elderly individuals unaware that they can access the internet without subscribing to AOL. Sooner or later, these customers will be brought up to speed by their children or grandchildren, or they’ll simply die off. Rather than trying to survive in a black hole, it’s wiser to take your business apart and use old products for new purposes. That’s what rule eleven advises. Texas Instruments, an electronics producer, did just that. In the 1980s, the company had a firm and profitable position in the home-computer market. But as competition stiffened it began to suffer losses. Soon Texas Instruments was on the verge of bankruptcy with a deficit of around $500 million. So it scrapped this part of the business, shifting its focus to the production of a single processing component. Though initially intended to serve as part of a toy, this component is now used in a wide range of electronic devices, from smartphones to radars, robots to CT scanners. The twelfth and final rule is the boldest of them all: try to restart the Big Bang Disruption life cycle by finding a new Singularity. Remember that AT&T-sponsored hackathon that sought to develop smartphone apps to assist people with autism? Well, AT&T wasn’t simply being benevolent and big-hearted. By investing time and money in the event, the company gained access to a crucial group – people who might turn out to be market disruptors. By having programmers and hackers use its networks and accessories, AT&T laid claim to the apps and innovations that emerged from the event. It’s this sort of strategizing that’ll put you in a position to jumpstart the next Singularity. The key message in these blinks: Today’s innovators are in a prime position to introduce products and services that are both cheaper and better than ever before. Such innovators are called Big Bang Disruptors, and they make use of exponential technologies – things like the internet, cloud-based computing and smartphones – to break into and disrupt markets. If you don’t want to get incinerated in the next big bang, then you’ve got to understand the life cycle of Big Bang Disruption and follow the 12 rules that’ll help you live through it. Got feedback?

    "summary": "Stoners. Drop-outs. 4/20 and Bob Marley. When you think of marijuana, what comes to mind? Few think of the cultivation and sale of Cannabis sativa as a legitimate and legal business, yet with the decriminalization of marijuana in many U.S. states, that’s just what it’s become. In fact, with the right strategy, a budding entrepreneur can make it big in the pot business. Based on the experiences of entrepreneur Christian Hageseth, these blinks tell the story of one man’s foray into the world of weed and shows how you too can turn kind bud into green cash. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you can’t sell bud and expect a bank to give you a business account; why there’s more to product research than just smoking up; how learning the facts about marijuana will make you a better businessperson. In the 1920s in the United States, the federal government prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol. Yet Prohibition was a disaster; the greater public flaunted the law at every turn and the government lost millions in tax revenue. The laws were eventually repealed. Today, marijuana is America’s bathtub gin. While many law enforcement officials continue to demonize pot, public support for the decriminalization of marijuana has been steadily rising.   Despite prolific warnings over the dangers of using drugs, it’s clear that the so-called war on drugs in America has been a failure. Not only have thousands of people been incarcerated for essentially non-violent crimes but also drug policies have destroyed families and lives. Yet the benefits of a drug like marijuana are many. It can act as powerful medicine to ease the suffering of the chronically ill, for example. Proponents thus say pot should be made legally available to such groups. Why deny chemotherapy patients medicine that could ease their suffering? Separately, politicians have started to understand just how much money can be made from legalizing the sale of marijuana. In the few U.S. states where the drug is now legal, tax revenue is filling state coffers. In 2009 alone, Colorado, a western state that has led the charge for legalization, collected some $3 million in taxes, fees and associated costs. Public pressure, combined with the backing of select politicians, has led to huge changes in marijuana policy. While many states have passed statutes allowing marijuana only for medical use, states like Colorado also have legalized pot for recreational purposes. This more liberal attitude toward marijuana is sure to increase, giving rise to a “new world of marijuana.” Yet rather than being a business controlled by gangsters and drug cartels, it will be a normal industry with brands, business strategies and tax accountants. Attitudes to marijuana in the United States have relaxed in recent years. But this doesn’t mean that everyone believes that it should be legalized; many think drugs across the board are dangerous. Why has this negative opinion of marijuana persisted in society? One of the main issues with regard to legalization is that after so many years of being classified as an illegal drug, marijuana is still associated with street crime and criminals. If you ever used marijuana or had friends who did, the likelihood that they purchased it on the street from a dealer is high. And the fear persists that marijuana is a “gateway” drug. If you buy drugs from criminals, what’s to stop you from accessing and experimenting with other, more dangerous, drugs? These are some of the main reasons why so many people still campaign against legalization. The author himself ran into this when he set up his own, legal marijuana business.   Many friends and business associates were skeptical. After all, they said, wasn’t marijuana just a vice for stoners and criminals? Interestingly, marijuana’s inclusion on the list of illegal substances was actually done for political reasons. Even though marijuana has been a part of human society for hundreds of years, in the twentieth century, political forces found reasons to curb its use. (A marijuana pipe was found even in the gardens of legendary playwright William Shakespeare!) Politicians, looking for a scapegoat for societal problems and eager to protect their own economic interests, worked to ban marijuana. They believed that criminalizing the drug and disseminating anti-marijuana propaganda was a vote-winning and money-making tactic. What is more surprising is that such campaigns continued despite growing scientific research that clearly showed marijuana wasn’t the societal evil it was billed as. In 1972, a Senate commission report revealed that marijuana did not in fact lead to physical dependence. What’s more, the overwhelming majority of people who used marijuana did not then move on to other harder drugs. This report was, however, ignored. Since marijuana has for so long been illegal, early attempts to profit from legalization have been unorthodox, to say the least. Many marijuana sellers simply find a shop, buy some stock and try to sell it. And most fail. Achieving success in the pot business requires you to think exactly how you would in any other business niche. You need to come up with an effective business strategy. The author began his business with a clear goal in mind: to make marijuana America’s new consumer product, branded and marketed intelligently. In addition to marketing, you will also need to keep tight controls on the growing process. Marijuana plants aren’t easy to cultivate, as they require lots of light. Yet lots of light leads to heat and humidity, which is actually bad for the plants. So it makes sense to purchase an air conditioning system for your grow space. This in turn amounts to a great deal of energy use! To lower your energy costs, the best approach is to think in broad terms from the outset. One large air conditioning unit costs less to run than a number of smaller ones. To make a large unit worth the expense, however, you need to invest in a lot of plants. The author found this out the hard way. After three failed harvests, he increased his production size and found just the right balance for success. Since marijuana is still treated with suspicion, as a pot entrepreneur you need to work on creating a culture in which it’s more normalized and accepted. The author learned this firsthand after a trip to the Netherlands, where drug laws are harsher than in the United States but the culture more accepting of marijuana use. So you’re ready to light up and be a marijuana entrepreneur. Think about how great it would be to sit around and “test” your product, all day! Not so fast. Before you inhale, consider your business. You need to inform yourself about every single aspect of the market if you want to stand any chance of actually making a profit. First, learn as much as you can about your product. Marijuana can be used in many different ways. Although smoking is the most well-known method, it isn’t really the best. Inhaling the smoke of burning plant material means toxins are going directly into your lungs. Some better alternatives include vaporizers, which heat up the pot until the plant’s cannabinoids become airborne and can be inhaled. Another alternative is to bake the drug into cookies or other food items, for a delayed effect. However, this is harder to dose. Next, get to know your market. Create a brand to market your product effectively. As in any industry, if you want to sell successfully and keep customers coming back, you need to have a ubiquitous, trusted brand. The author created his own brand, Green Man Cannabis. With the desire of becoming the market leader in the industry, he took care to brand every area of his business effectively. Finally, you need to understand your customers. The author’s goal is to introduce marijuana to a wider audience while at the same time demystifying the product. To that end, he’s building a large-scale marijuana growth facility to educate others. The Green Man Cannabis Ranch, which will include a terrace, atrium, open greenhouse and a shop, will be a place where customers can better understand his brand and his product. And once you’ve put in the hours and work to grow your business in a smart way, sure – go ahead and kick back occasionally and enjoy the benefits of your product! The legal marijuana business is a business like any other. But there is one area in which legal marijuana sellers are actually prevented from participating in what should be normal business practices. While most business owners can open a bank account to safely store their profits, legal marijuana business owners cannot. As marijuana is still illegal in many U.S. states and according federal statutes, and any money deposited in U.S. banks is backed by the federal government, the feds can deny anyone involved in an industry they deem illegal from holding or depositing funds in a bank account. For those involved in the legal marijuana businesses, this is a real headache. Cold hard cash is your currency for almost everything, including paying for electricity and gas – even your taxes. It’s time-consuming as well as risky, as you’ll be carrying serious amounts of cash around with you often. It will probably take some time to overcome such discrimination on both on the state and federal level toward those in the legal marijuana industry. Police officers, politicians and judges were taught almost all their life that marijuana is bad. Thus it may be a while before these groups will be able to let go of their prejudices, even when marijuana is legalized. Keeping marijuana illegal however causes more problems than it solves. The so-called war on drugs has massively increased the number of law enforcement agencies and prisons around the country. Some 800,000 Americans annually are arrested and sentenced for marijuana crimes, which begs the question of how prisons are able to cope with all these inmates. Unfortunately, the criminalization of marijuana and all drugs is also a business for many industries, and powerful lobbies have an interest to keep things they way they are. So if you plan to get into the legal marijuana business, be prepared to face a number of obstacles. The legal marijuana business is still in its early days, yet with time, it will flourish while also changing significantly. The tobacco industry is now barred from selling legal marijuana, but this won’t always be the case. Big agriculture at some point will get involved, industrializing cultivation quickly. Thus the days when you’ll be able to pick up a pack of marijuana cigarettes at the corner store are probably not so far away! But whether that pack will be natural and organic is another question. The forces of capitalism will not be long in molding this nascent industry, as larger, better capitalized firms buy out smaller, local dispensaries and push national brands. A comeback for hemp is also a possibility. German car manufacturers BMW and Mercedes-Benz use hemp for car door panels; this is coming soon to the United States. As hemp becomes more ubiquitous, marijuana’s bad rep may also fade. And although decent-quality pot will be readily available for consumers in this expanded market, serious connoisseurs may seek out higher-quality products – another business opportunity. Today’s pot is far stronger than the weed groovy kids were smoking at Woodstock in the 1960s. Marijuana then contained about three percent THC (pot’s psychoactive component) compared with up to 25 percent today. We probably won’t see a trend for stronger marijuana, but instead for consistently dosed servings. We know that one ounce of vodka has the same alcoholic effect as five ounces of wine and 12 ounces of beer, for example. One joint, however, can’t be compared to another. This will certainly change, if not just to make recreational use more measurable and predictable. Finally, we will also see a change in U.S. federal policy. While legalization today is not a top federal priority, with greater demand and a need for increased tax revenues, the call for legalization will grow. The key message in this book: The push to legalize marijuana will continue to evolve in the United States. Already, the public’s perception of marijuana culture has changed for the better; law enforcement too is grappling with new attitudes and newer laws. As marijuana becomes a serious and legal business opportunity, society may take a more accepting and constructive look at how to market and use the drug responsibly. Actionable advice: Consider what a marijuana tax could do for your town. The next time you’re involved in a discussion on legalization, think about the dollars and cents of both sides of the argument. Are the associated costs of keeping marijuana illegal greater or less than the benefits your community could reap were it to collect taxes on legal marijuana use?

    "title": "Blitzscaling",
    "author": "Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh",
    "summary": "As 1996 came to a close, industrial age giants were still the most valuable companies in the world: General Electric, Royal Dutch Shell, the Coca-Cola Company, ExxonMobil and a Japanese telecommunications company named Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. Fast-forward just two decades to the present day, and none of those companies is in the top five anymore. They’ve been replaced by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. In the intervening time, the world economy has come to be dominated by giant tech companies such as these. The 150 most valuable tech companies in Silicon Valley alone are valued at an astounding $3.5 trillion. Many tech companies have grown from scrappy start-ups to corporate giants in just a few years. Amazon, Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Uber, Snapchat, PayPal, LinkedIn, eBay – the list goes on and on. What are the secrets of this phenomenal growth? One of the main ones can be summed up in a single word: blitzscaling. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the heck the word “blitzscaling” means; why fortune favors the bold in the modern economy; and how one of the keys to making money is often losing money. “Blitzscaling” is a recently invented word, so if you’re not sure what it means, you’re in good company! The easiest way to define “blitzscaling” is to break it down into its components: “blitz” and “scaling.” In German, “blitz” means lightning. In modern English, it’s become an informal way to describe what happens when an organization tries to achieve something at lightning speed. For example, if a company suddenly floods the airwaves with a full-throttle advertising campaign, it would be a “marketing blitz.” “Scaling,” in turn, is shorthand for “scaling up.” In business, that means two things. First, it means growing a company in a way that keeps all of its parts proportional to each other as it develops. That’s important, because to sell more products or services, a company needs to expand its infrastructure, resources and labor force, and they have to keep pace with each other for the growth to be sustainable. For instance, imagine you’re a kid with a lemonade stand, and you want to expand your empire. To sell more lemonade, you need to invest in additional booths, lemons, cups and workers. If you try to expand in just one of these areas, the expansion won’t be sustainable. After all, if you run out of cups, it won’t matter how many lemons you can squeeze! If you manage to avoid this problem and your lemonade empire spreads to every block of the city, you’ve achieved “scaling” in the second sense of the term: your company is operating on a massive scale! Put those ideas together, and you have a first approximation of what “blitzscaling” means: it’s business growth that’s not only very rapid, but also proportional, and therefore sustainable. It’s what happened when Amazon went from having 151 employees and $5.1 million in revenue in 1996 to having 7,600 employees and $1.64 billion in revenue in 1999 – a 50-fold increase in employees and a 322-fold increase in revenue, all in just three years! But there’s a caveat we need to add to our definition. Every company seeks to grow, and every successful company grows. If “blitzscaling” only meant growing rapidly and sustainably, it would be just another word for impressive business success. While blitzscaling involves rapid, sustainable growth, there’s more to it than that. We’ll find out what the missing ingredients are in the next blinks. The word “blitz” has an unfortunate but instructive history. It goes back to the German word “blitzkrieg,” which means “lightning war.” This became the name of a military strategy that the German military implemented during World War II. Inspired by British military thinkers and later adopted by the Allies, this strategy represented a radical shift in how militaries approached warfare. In the past, they would advance slowly and cautiously into enemy territory, aiming to secure their supply lines and paths of retreat before moving forward. With blitzkrieg, in contrast, an army would advance swiftly and decisively, hoping to take the enemy by storm. This strategy involves significant risks; the attacking army might run out of supplies or be cut off from retreat. But the potential reward of overwhelming the enemy often outweighs these risks. Blitzscaling also involves throwing caution to the wind. Indeed, embracing uncertainty and risk is the word’s third defining component. Like an army of the past, a traditional company would seek to secure its position on the business battlefield (a market) before advancing to expand its territory (its market share). For instance, if an American company wanted to expand overseas, it would typically set up an office in one country, wait for it to establish itself, set up another office in a second country, wait again and so on. A blitzscaling company, in contrast, charges full-steam ahead. For example, between 2011 and 2012, Airbnb’s number of international offices rapidly grew from zero to nine. This is very risky, and it would have been much safer for Airbnb to take the traditional approach. After all, if you’ve already slowly but steadily established eight international offices one-by-one, you can feel pretty confident about the ninth. But for Airbnb, the traditional approach wasn’t an option. They had a German competitor named Wimdu hot on their heels, copying their business model. If they’d waited to have all of their ducks in a row before expanding, they’d probably have been too late; Wimdu would have conquered the international market before Airbnb’s arrival. So they took a gamble – and it paid off. They nipped the Wimdu threat in the bud, which led to a ten-fold increase in Airbnb’s bookings. Traditional businesses prioritize the efficient use of capital; they seek to get the most bang out of each buck at their disposal. A coffee shop, for example, is spending wisely when it buys its paper cups in bulk – a big box of cups only costs a few dollars but it enables hundreds of future sales. But blitzscaling companies do things differently, prioritizing speed over efficiency. That’s why local taxi companies shudder when a peer-to-peer ridesharing company like Uber rolls into town. Traditionally, a company trying to grab some of its competitors’ market share might try to undercut them by lowering its own prices. This could be balanced out by lowering production costs – but that’s a long, difficult process that might only allow for a very small price drop anyway. So what does a blitzscaling company like Uber do? It drops prices so low that they don’t even cover costs – a strategy that, for traditional businesses, would amount to corporate suicide. But Uber can afford to do this because it has a huge advantage – a war chest of billions of dollars in investment capital, and no compunction about using it to its advantage. This allows Uber to lose money for the sake of conquering a new market as quickly as possible. It’s a risky strategy, but one that can offer a big payoff in the form of first-scaler advantage. First-scaler advantage goes to the company that is first to scale up and dominate its business ecosystem. Once a company has done that, it becomes incredibly hard to compete against, making competition in today’s economy, especially in the tech industry, increasingly a winner-take-all sprint to the finish line. Think back to the early years of online social networking, when Facebook, MySpace and Friendster were all competing for dominance. Now, when’s the last time you used MySpace or Friendster? That’s because Facebook successfully scaled up. Uber’s strategy is to aggressively expand, city by city, and its prioritization of speed over efficiency allows it to dominate new markets quickly and gain first-scaler advantage. Another advantage that blitzscaling companies enjoy is the ability to leverage the increasingly networked nature of our world. We'll explore that in the next blink. Growth factors are things that can boost the growth of a company, and there are four that every blitzscaling company should seek to maximize: network effects, market size, distribution and high gross margins. The first, network effects, can be a huge boost to any company scrambling to gain first-scaler advantage. Essentially, “network effects” occur when a network’s value increases for users as more people begin using it. Consider Airbnb. The more that people offer their properties on the company’s website, the more it becomes the go-to marketplace for guests seeking homestays. And the more that guests flock to the marketplace, the more people want to offer their properties on it. Network effects create a positive feedback loop. Because of this feedback loop, a start-up company wanting to compete with Airbnb will have their work cut out for them. Since its rapid, network-effect-powered growth allowed Airbnb to seize the homestay market’s first-scaler advantage, Airbnb has a virtually insurmountable head start on all would-be competitors. Where there’s a network – and networks are all around us these days – there’s the potential for a network effect, a fact that many tech companies have used to gain success. Uber, Airbnb and eBay connect buyers and sellers of goods and services to massive marketplace networks. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter connect people into multimillion- or even multibillion-user (in the case of Facebook) social networks. YouTube connects video creators and consumers into the world’s most popular entertainment network. And then there’s the granddaddy network of them all: the internet itself, along with the network of more than two billion smartphone users who can access that network anytime, anywhere. Of course, that network is also a resource that tech companies are eager to tap into. For them, it represents the ultimate marketplace, open 24/7 and located everywhere at once without the need for expensive brick-and-mortar shops. Of course, potential customers don’t necessarily equate to sales. For that, you need people who are willing and able to buy – in other words, a market. That’s the idea behind market size as a growth factor. For a company to blitzscale, its market needs to be sizable. Otherwise, there just won’t be enough money to fuel or motivate its funding and growth. Gross margins are a pretty simple concept. They’re a measure of how much money your business takes in after costs are covered. Let’s say that your product costs you $0.50 to produce and sell. That’s your cost of goods sold, or COGS. Then you sell the product for $0.75 per unit – that’s your revenue. Well, $0.75 revenue minus a $0.50 COGS equals $0.25 – that’s your gross margin, the money you have in the bank after each sale. It’s distinct from profit, since you might use it to cover other expenses like taxes. It’s important though because it’s a ready source of funding for any new initiative you might want to pursue, from expanding your operations to developing a new product line. And when you want to rapidly grow your company to a massive scale, high gross margins become crucial. Gross margin is usually represented as a percentage, calculated by dividing it by revenue. Dividing our $0.25 gross margin by $0.75 in revenue, then, gives a gross margin of 33 percent. That’s higher than General Electric’s margin of 27 percent. But most tech-industry giants have gross margins that start at 60 percent and can be as high as 90 percent. Google’s is 61 percent, and Facebook’s is 87 percent. High gross margins give you more than money. They also make it easier for you to fund expansion, because the higher they are, the more investors will notice you. Imagine that company A has a gross margin of 66 percent, while Company B’s is 33 percent. That means that B brings in half as much money per sale as A, and has to generate twice as many sales just to end up with the same amount of cash. That’s going to require more resources, more infrastructure and more workers than its competitor – not just for manufacturing, but for things like handling customer service phone lines for twice as many customers. To investors, it’s clear that A has a much better chance of growing than B and, because of this, they’ll choose to invest in the former. This leads to another positive feedback loop: with more investment capital to spend on expanding its operations, A will grow even more easily than B. When investors see that growth, even more of their money will flow A’s way, leading to yet more growth. Thus, high gross margins allow companies to accumulate the massive war chests of capital required to pursue growth on the equally massive scale of blitzscaling – and, as we’ll see, tech companies have a natural advantage when it comes to achieving high gross margins, and therefore attracting capital. You might have a brilliant product and a well-defined market clamoring for it, but getting it into the hands of customers isn’t just a technicality. Distribution is also a growth factor, and distributing a product or service on a massive scale can happen in two ways. The first is using a distribution network that already exists, like the US Postal Service (USPS). Netflix tapped into this when it launched its original rent-a-DVD-by-mail service. Amazon takes advantage of it, too, striking a deal with USPS that allows it to ship small packages for only about $1 each. The other method is viral distribution. First, you infect one customer, then she infects more customers. Each of them infects even more customers, and so forth and so on. There are two kinds of viral distribution, organic and incentivized, and the early days of PayPal provide an example of both. Back then, every time a buyer wanted to send a payment via PayPal, the seller had to set up a PayPal account to receive it. This organic viral distribution naturally led to more users of the service. PayPal’s incentivized distribution, meanwhile, actively provided users with an incentive to spread its service: get a friend to sign up for it, and both you and your friend receive $10 each. Combining these two varieties of viral distribution, PayPal was able to grow at an astonishing rate of between 7 and 10 percent per day. Imagine, then, the kind of growth that’s possible when there isn’t a need for physical distribution, nor for the infrastructure, resources and workers that distribution centers entail. To do without such things, you’ve got to go digital. Consider a software company whose demand doubles overnight. To meet that demand and double sales, the company will need…nothing. It costs essentially zero to duplicate a piece of software that merely needs to be copied from one set of circuits to another. But digital companies aren’t only extremely scalable; they also enjoy high gross margins. Because they can easily plug into the internet and its online marketplace networks, digital companies can reap all the rewards of network effects and gain access to large markets for their products. These perks, combined with ease of product duplication, are a perfect recipe for excellent gross margins. That’s why so many successful examples of blitzscaling come from the tech industry; having a digital product and service allows companies to take advantage of all four of blitzscaling’s growth factors. It also helps minimize the two big growth limiters – both of which we’ll explore in the remaining blinks. To generate the level of sales and revenue that blitzscaling requires, you need to identify a good market and offer a product that satisfies that market – in other words, you’ve got to achieve product/market fit. This fit is the first of two growth limiters that blitzscaling companies need to watch out for. The greater the product/market fit, the greater the chance of rapid growth. But immediately achieving perfect product/market fit isn’t easy. To improve the fit, most companies have to adjust their product to make it better suit the market’s demands. It’s easier for a tech company to be nimble with regard to product/market fit, of course; tinkering by bringing out a new version of software or testing out a new app feature requires less infrastructure than redoing a physical commodity. You just have to edit some code, not buy new machinery. Tech companies can also pivot much more easily than companies with a physical product, switching from trying to achieve one product/market fit to another. Consider PayPal. In its first year of operation (originally under the name of Confinity), it went through four pivots – shifting its service from cell-phone encryption to cell-phone payments, then to PalmPilot payments, then to email payments and finally to eBay transactions. Now imagine that you’ve achieved an ideal product/market fit and generated high demand, but you haven’t got the mass-production capabilities to fulfill that demand. You’re losing out on potential sales, which means you’ll need to scale up your operations to get to the necessary level of mass production. Navigating the challenges of the second growth limiter of blitzscaling, operational scalability, can make or break a company. This limiter isn’t as daunting for tech companies, which rely less on physical infrastructure. But even a digital-only company has some physical infrastructure to expand in order to scale up – and failure to do this can be devastating. For example, remember Friendster? It was a serious contender for the social network crown, the first of its kind to break through into the mainstream. Friendster went viral in 2003, gaining millions of users in just a few months. But the company’s computer servers couldn’t keep up with the demand, with users waiting up to 40 seconds for the website to load. Within two years, a speedier competitor called MySpace had left Friendster in the dust. The challenges of scaling up are complex – and they become increasingly complex as a company grows. Consider just one of the challenges: company organization. If you start a company with three friends, organization can be pretty informal and based on one-to-one relationships. After all, there are only six pairs of unique relationships between the four of you. But if you add just two people, the number of relationships shoots up to 15. Add another 20, and you’re up to 325. When you have 25,000 employees, as Facebook does, you’re at more than 312 million relationships. More formal organization quickly becomes necessary, meaning that departments need to be created, and these departments need managers and submanagers. Growing complexity brings with it thorny questions of management philosophy, organizational hierarchy and company culture. These questions are especially challenging for a blitzscaling company, since it has to continually answer and reanswer them in the midst of rapid, massive growth. Having a management strategy in place to handle this process is crucial. Uber found this out the hard way in late 2016 and early 2017, a period of management problems and turmoil from which the company is still recovering. Sexual harassment allegations emerged. The Verge reported a scheme that involved Uber creating fake accounts with its rival Lyft. Eight vice presidents and department heads left the company in just half a year. A management strategy won’t mean much without a business plan that secures long-term growth, however. Initially, a blitzscaling company with the right investment backing can afford to lose money for the sake of rapid expansion and market dominance – but only for a while. Once it achieves dominance, those losses need to turn into profits. Otherwise, you’ll have displeased investors who may cut off the flow of investment capital that’s been powering your growth. But for a company with a digital product or service, transforming losses into gains can be a challenge. That’s because people generally aren’t willing to shell out much money for such products and services. If Facebook charged you a quarter every time you logged in, would you check your timeline multiple times per day? Even if your company has maximized all the growth factors it takes to blitzscale, it won’t generate huge profits long-term without the right business plan. Look at Craigslist or IMDb (the International Movie Database). They fit the profile of blitzscaling companies, optimizing network effects and product/market fit, and they’re valuable in their own, nonmonetary ways. But they don’t earn much. So how can tech companies make money? We’ll look at some ways in the next blink. For a company that wants to be successful at blitzscaling, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for developing a business plan that can convert massive growth into equally massive profits. However, there are seven general patterns that successful companies have followed. Three of these relate directly to the advantages of doing business digitally. The first pattern involves the advantages of selling a product that is purely digital. For example, consider an extra, purchasable outfit, or “skin,” for a character in a video game. Since it only exists virtually, a skin costs practically nothing to make and sell. This means gross margins of nearly 100 percent. Purely digital products have become a very lucrative line of business for many tech companies, especially in the video game industry. Of course, if you’re a company with physical products, you can’t just magically turn them into digital ones – but you can still harness the power of going digital. This is the second pattern. For example, Amazon is heavily invested in physical products – to wit, the millions of things you can buy from its online store. That’s a lot of things to manage – but Amazon has turned to digital-management systems to make the most efficient use of its inventory. It’s also been increasingly turning to its software-as-a-service (SaaS) division, Amazon Web Services, which generated 150 percent of Amazon’s revenue in 2016. SaaS revenues were so high that they covered the losses of Amazon’s retail business! What is SaaS? Well, that’s the third pattern. It basically means selling software on a subscription model, rather than on a one-time-purchase or licensing model. The latter used to be the traditional model for selling enterprise software, which is software meant for organizations rather than individuals. To make that model work, the licenses for the software had to be sold for thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars, which priced out small and medium-sized businesses, and therefore limited the software’s market size. With the subscription model, however, a cloud-computing software company like Salesforce can sell its products and services at a much lower cost, greatly expanding its market size in the process. The more a company can do business digitally, then the greater the potential for outsized profits. And facilitating other companies’ digital endeavors has huge potential all its own, as we’ll see in the next blink. If you’re buying or selling a product in the current networked age, then you’re probably familiar with the go-to platform for conducting your business. For example, if you’re a music label, an ebook publisher or a movie distributor, the iTunes store has become one of your go-to selling platforms. That’s the fourth successful pattern – leveraging the power of platforms. If you can establish your product or service as the standard platform for buying and selling products, creating documents or doing any other kind of revenue-generating activity, you yourself stand to capture a large share of that revenue. Apple, for example, takes a hefty 30 percent cut of the proceeds from products sold on the iTunes store. It’s closely related to the fifth pattern, which is taking advantage of the growth potential of online marketplaces. These are a specific type of platform – platforms that not only bring buyers and sellers together, but also let them set their own prices through the market forces of supply and demand, just as Airbnb and eBay do. For profit seekers, the attraction of marketplaces is the same as normal platforms: you can take a cut of the transactions. The sixth pattern involves tapping into the eyeball-capturing power of online content-sharing feeds, like Twitter or Facebook’s timelines. Because feeds are so effective at captivating people’s attention, they’re very attractive to advertisers, who will pay premium prices to insert their ads and sponsored content into addictive streams of information and entertainment. Advertising also brings us to the seventh and final pattern, which is to offer your product or service for free and try to make money some other way. Advertising is an option here, too. Another is offering a premium service and hoping users upgrade to it from the free one. For example, DropBox offers people 2 gigabytes of cloud-based storage for free. If you like the service and want more storage, you have to pay for it. These seven patterns aren’t recipes, but each has been used as a guideline by many massively profitable businesses. As with all the hallmarks of blitzscaling, they’re new (or relatively new) and they’re bold, and they have the potential to lead to outrageous success. Let them inspire you, and watch your company grow at lightning speed. The key message in these blinks: Blitzscaling requires an outsized ambition and a tolerance for taking big risks in the hope of a big payoff. Increasingly, though, there are some patterns to guide this kind of ambitious thinking. Embracing uncertainty and risk while prioritizing speed over efficiency, taking advantage of four growth factors and navigating growth limiters can all set a company up for rapid and massive expansion that will be sustainable in the future. But the hands at the helm also have to be realistic about what they’re steering their company into, with management strategy and a business plan that anticipate the changes and challenges of rapid growth. With a clear vision, blitzscaling can help a business dominate an ecosystem for a long time to come. Actionable advice: Look at blitzscaling success stories outside of the tech industry. In these blinks, we focused on companies in the tech industry because they provide the clearest illustrations of how blitzscaling works. However, blitzscaling can happen outside of the tech industry and even beyond the business world altogether. The clothing company Zara, the nonprofit educational organization Khan Academy and the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama are all examples of companies and organizations that implemented elements of blitzscaling outside of the tech industry.

    "title": "Building Your Business the Right-Brain Way",
    "author": "Jennifer Lee",
    "summary": "Are you more left-brained or right-brained? That is, do you look at problems analytically and rationally, or instead, creatively and emotionally? Regardless whether you trend right or left, the key is not to let either side of your brain completely own the other. Even in business, where left-brain thinkers tend to rule, you can’t possibly hope to succeed without a good dose of intuition, creativity and empathy – things the right side of your brain controls. These blinks discuss not only how you can ensure your “right-brain” has its say in your business, but also how creative people can tackle left-brained tasks – so you too can successfully juggle mundane administrative work while thinking creatively about your next business project! In these blinks, you’ll find out why customers are like honeybees and you are the honey; how to know when to offload administrative tasks; and why you should think of your products as gifts. Countless business books stress the importance of strategic thinking, analytical skills and detailed planning. Sounds sensible, right? Well, entrepreneurship isn’t strictly about just being sensible or rational. There’s no reason for you to only focus on your left-brain qualities when creativity and other right-brain qualities are just as vital. Just as an artist crafts his masterpiece, the entrepreneur crafts his business model. Building a new solution or new product takes a ton of imaginative thinking, and the process isn’t linear. A truly creative process is one that winds along a path of trial and error, of sudden inspiration and “eureka” moments. Think about how a painting takes shape. At first, there’s just a vision in the artist’s head. That idea is sketched, and the canvas is filled with paint and life. Maybe one color doesn’t fit, and it’s painted over. The forms and shapes that appear trigger new inspirations. In the end, the final product is almost always different than the artist’s initial vision. That’s exactly what happens when you start tinkering with your business or start a new one. Indeed, some of the most important business skills are located in the right hemisphere of your brain!   It’s widely accepted in neurological studies that that traits like intuition, non-linear thinking, creative problem solving, empathy and imagination mainly take place in the right hemisphere of your brain, while the left hemisphere is more responsible for structural and logical thinking. While accounting, scheduling and strategic planning is obviously of value in business, right-brain skills are important too. Just think about marketing messages and how they are based often on making an emotional connection with a potential customer – certainly the strength of the right-brained talent! Let your brain’s right hemisphere run wild for a bit, and imagine your business as a flower, one that is blooming and filled with nectar to entice honeybees, or specifically, potential customers.   A flower’s blossom sprouts from within, and that’s exactly how you should see your business: a great business idea begins with your inner passion. When artist Melissa Gazzaneo travelled to Bali to help her mother teach English to children, she discovered that children there loved her handmade arts and crafts. As Melissa grew more and more passionate about the idea of helping children pursue their creativity, she realized she could build a business around her idea. And that’s exactly what she did, turning her passion into a business that made bags from recycled gear while at the same time, raising funds to deliver art supplies to disadvantaged children around the world. Now that you know the source from which your business should bloom, how do you attract honeybees? Easy: by communicating your passion with a core message. This should be nothing more than an authentic expression of who you are and what you stand for. Melissa’s core message, “Repurposed for a Purpose,” says loud and clear that providing aid is her key motivation in leading her business. But what good is a core message if nobody hears it? Consultant and facilitator Laura Burns took this to the extreme by tattooing her core message on her chest, “Married to Amazement.” Granted, you needn’t take your commitment this far – think about your own way of communicating your core message to customers clearly and in a way that’s as unique as is your product! But if you’re concerned that your business isn’t reaching potential customers worldwide, don’t worry. It’s not important to attract all the honeybees in the world, just the ones with whom your core message really resonates. These are after all the customers who are more likely to understand the value of your product. Unlike flowers, business owners don’t have to hang around waiting for honeybees – we can go out and find them! The more people you connect with, the wider your pool of supporters will be. In your network of supporters, everyone has value: some may become your customers, some may help encourage business decisions and others may assist in spreading your message. So how do you make these connections? Personal and direct communication is what gets people listening. Imagine that selling your product to a customer is like convincing your sweetheart to take you out for a date. Write every email newsletter like a love letter, complete with a touching headline.   Parent-coach Sheila Pai starts her promotion emails with the introduction, “Dear Hardworking Parent, Parenting is hard, hard, HARD work.” In doing so, she shows empathy and understanding for her customers’ feelings and needs. Talking to people and spreading your message is of course great. But you can increase your impact when you address exactly the right people with the right information at the right moment. Imagine you’re launching a new coaching program. You can start by building excitement with tantalizing teasers, perhaps recording a behind-the-scenes video that reveals preparations for the course. When your launch date approaches, widely open the doors and invite your audience to take action. You could publish a Q&A covering the most important information in your course, dish-out event invitations and make sign-up forms available online. After your first session, you can use weekly reminders and gentle nudges to keep your offer in the heads of those interested and to attract late-comers. This way you’ll be drawing people in at every stage. Remember the last surprise gift you received? How good did it make you feel? A gift comes from the heart, and sharing a gift is way more fun and gratifying than simply selling something. The author once had a college friend with whom she shared a passion for getting each other just the right gift. Whenever they saw a perfect goodie, they grabbed it and surprised each other just because it brought them joy. That’s the kind of mind-set which helps you empathize with your customers and anticipate their wishes and needs. Life coach Kerri Richardson for a long time had an awkward feeling that she was “begging for money” when it came to her work. A shift in her mind-set from selling to sharing helped her become more customer-oriented. Kerri now sees her training sessions as worthwhile opportunities for people to meet like-minded people and to get support to realize their dreams. Just think: when you give a gift, you’re considering basically the same questions as when you design a product. Who is the recipient? Why is this a good gift for this person especially, and how will she benefit from it? Is the price appropriate? And, how can you wrap the gift so it looks good? Just like a present is more fun wrapped in brightly colored paper and ribbons, so too will your product benefit from you paying attention to the little details. For example, when selling a handmade leather bag, you could gift a unique accessory, or even offer a free subscription to your online leatherwork courses. Most entrepreneurs are driven by their passions. But chances are that they’re also in business to earn a living – in other words, to make money. Service-oriented business models, such as coaching, swap time for money in a direct way. The same goes for artisanal work, where you sell an individual product that you make with your own labor. Such models eventually reach a financial ceiling. In these time-for-money models, there are three paths to making a profit: attract new customers, sell more to existing customers or raise your prices. As a coach, you might offer a face-to-face hour session and receive payment afterwards. However, the number of sessions you provide depends on how much time you have. You can’t serve an endless stream of customers, for example, because you don’t want to overwork yourself! On the other hand, there’s also a limit to the amount of money people are willing to pay. What should you do? Think creatively! You could turn individual coaching sessions into group sessions, for example. This would allow you to increase your number of customers, earn more income and even allow you to eventually lower your prices to attract even more customers. Jane, a holistic health consultant, offers a good example of creative problem-solving. In ten hours, she was able to create a six-module home study course that she delivers online. From this point forward, she is able to earn money with almost no additional hours or labor. But what if you offer products and not services? As a leather artisan, you could begin to offer services, perhaps in the form of group lessons in leather work or by distributing patterns or tutorials. Even if you’re passionate about sharing your gifts with the world, there still might be something stopping you. Any guess what that might be? If you’re put off by the idea of administrative work that is time-consuming but still “needs to be done,” don’t despair. Nobody expects you to shoulder all the work alone – so why not simply ask for help? In your dream business, you might have the urge to control everything yourself. But in the long term, you’ll burn out and lose your creative energy. Before this happens, try to determine which tasks you should outsource. Ask yourself the following questions: What are you not good at? What takes too much time? What comes easy but bores you? What drives you crazy? For a long time, fiction-writing coach Beth needed to do everything on her own, until the point when she found herself overwhelmed with work. Beth then bit the bullet and hired an assistant to manage her online tasks. This allowed Beth to focus again on the work she truly cared about. There are several options for you in recruiting support. When it comes to administrative tasks, bookkeeping or web management, you can hire outside specialists for fair payment. Or instead of hiring someone, you could team up and create a strategic partnership with any of the countless creative entrepreneurs who are caught up in similar situations. Life coach Tiffany Han, for example, collaborated with 12 artists. Together they worked as a team to create a product package, combining art prints with a coaching exercise. In doing so, they not only developed an attractive product but also minimized their marketing workload, as they were able to draw on a much bigger network. Your head is probably bursting with ideas for new courses, innovative creative solutions or unique art pieces. It’s no wonder that you lose focus from time to time! But if you find yourself off-track more often than you’d like, consider doing some long-term planning. This doesn’t mean you need to bury yourself in Excel spreadsheets. You can just as easily get your hands dirty and sketch out your work horizon and income plan using a huge wall calendar and colorful markers. For example, the author usually launches one new seminar program every quarter. For each launch, she notes down the main tasks, deadlines and expected earnings on her wall calendar, so she can keep everything literally in sight. Writer and web designer Mari Pfeiffer uses mind maps to visually document the important tasks in her business processes. With the actual task placed in the middle of the map, the branches around it explore how often the task occurs, what processes it requires, who needs to be involved and which questions typically arise. Consistently mapping out your work this way can also give you insight into patterns. You may see that a lot of tasks recur periodically; these are the ones you can plan to execute with less effort next time. Documentation of previous work can even be used as templates for upcoming projects. The author once was unexpectedly invited to present an offer for a workshop with a popular live broadcast show. The task seemed impossible, until she remembered to look at her old sketchbooks, and was able to craft a proposal using bits from earlier work. Her proposal was a hit and it earned her extra cash and customers with hardly any effort. No matter which approach you take, give it your own creative twist and adapt your routines as you see fit – so you can keep both sides of your brain happy! Know the saying, “When it rains, it pours?” The author sure does. Her decision to move to a new home was put on hold when her boyfriend had a bike accident and her dad took a bad fall and spent weeks in the hospital. Your left-brain tendencies may aspire to control everything, but it’s simply not possible. The right-brain alternative is to let go of the urge for control and face life with ease. This way, you’ll be able to sustain the business that you worked so hard to establish. If doing things “with ease” sounds vague to you, don’t worry – here are three helpful strategies to put you in the right frame of mind. The first strategy is to seek out simple solutions. The author herself would often get stuck in her own complex plans, and achieve nothing. Finally when she stopped overthinking and simply jotted down some notes for a book, she found herself on the road to two major projects! The second strategy is to take time off. It’s as straightforward as blocking off some space in your schedule for relaxing, perhaps in the form of work-free evenings. And the third strategy is to create a work environment that cares for you. Start by sticking small positive notes on your desk to give you strength when times get tough, and then create your own specific routines that make you work well and feel well, too. Yoga teacher and life coach Sharon Tessandori places self-care at the top of her business agenda. When swamped with emails and admin work, she takes a seat on her yoga mattress first and centers herself before taking it all on. Like Sharon, remember that you are the most important person in your business. So why not make things work for you? The key message in this book: Creative thinkers who want to turn their passion into a business work best when they use the strengths of the right hemisphere of their brain. By turning an entrepreneurial idea into something that is visual, playful and deeply human, you’ll be able to sustain the imaginative spark that drew you into the world of business in the first place. Actionable advice: Paint your plans with the right markers! The next time you want to sketch out a plan for your new product launch or campaign, use bold and colorful markers. A marker’s thick lines make it hard to get obsessed with small details, and will keep you focused on broader concepts. Save your ballpoint pens for filling in the details afterward!    Suggested further reading: Everybody Writes by Ann Handley Everybody Writes (2014) gives you invaluable advice on how to create great content, from using correct grammar to crafting engaging posts, tweets and emails.

    "title": "Built to Last",
    "author": "Jim Collins",
    "summary": "So-called visionary companies have a lot to teach us. They are companies with long track-records for success and widely admired as the crown jewels of their industries. What’s more, their success is enduring – they prosper even as great leaders retire and individual hit-products become obsolete. To properly study and learn from these companies, the authors first had to identify them by surveying hundreds of prominent CEOs for the names of companies they considered visionary. The 18 most commonly mentioned firms – including such venerable names as the Walt Disney Company, Marriott Hotels, and Merck – were included in the study. The visionary companies were then paired up with comparison companies: firms that shared similar products and markets but which, while not being outright poor performers, were called “visionary” far less often in the CEO survey. Both groups of companies were then examined across their considerable life spans (the average founding date lay in the 1890s for both groups). Based on massive amounts of data from interviews, annual reports, financial statements, news articles and many other sources, all aspects of these corporations were studied, ranging from their ownership structures to their cultures. To understand the extraordinary success of the visionary companies, consider this fact: if you had invested a dollar in their shares in 1926, that dollar would have been worth $6,356 by 1990. Compare that to $955 if you had invested in the comparison companies, and only $415 if you had invested in the general market, and you’ll see just how impressive the visionary companies’ performance is. No wonder that all manner of Fortune 500 companies have been fascinated by the findings of this study. Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. Contrary to what most people believe, the success of a visionary company is not dependent on great ideas. The founder of Sony, for example, had no specific idea of what products his company would make. He actually held a brainstorming session after founding the company to evaluate business ideas ranging from sweetened bean-paste to miniature-golf equipment. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard also had no specific idea in mind when they founded Hewlett-Packard (HP). They experimented with almost farcically diverse ideas, such as automatic urinal flushers and bowling foul-line indicators. Hence, it seems that great ideas are not necessary for the start of a visionary company. Nor are high-profile, charismatic leaders. While visionary companies did have superb individuals at the top of their organization, they were often down-to-earth, reserved and modest people. But then, what is the secret of enduring success? Many comparison companies had great ideas and strong leadership, yet they all fell behind the visionary companies eventually. Why? Instead of focusing on a single product or a single leader, the visionary companies studied built themselves into outstanding organizations that constantly churned out great ideas and great leaders. The real creation of the founders was not a product at all but the company itself; constantly advancing independently of any one person or idea. Think of a clock on the wall. Having one great idea or visionary leader is like getting a glimpse of that clock and being able to tell the time in that instant. But building an organization that constantly generates great ideas and leaders is like building your own clock: a reliable machine. Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies have a higher purpose for their existence than to merely chase profits. Together with the companies’ core values – enduring tenets that guide their every decision – this purpose forms their core ideologies: a set of stable principles that guides the company through generations, much like the “truths” of the American Declaration of Independence. Consider for example the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J&J). In 1935, the CEO, Robert W. Johnson Jr., wrote out the company’s core ideology in a document called “Our Credo,” which listed the company’s responsibilities: first to their customers, second to their employees and so forth. Finally, fifth and last on the list, after all the other responsibilities had been fulfilled, Johnson said that shareholders should receive “a fair return.” Likewise, most visionary companies studied were not primarily after profit. Nevertheless, while some ideologies may seem soft or idealistic, visionary companies managed to find a way to stay pragmatic in their business decisions and make profits without ever wavering from their core ideologies. A core ideology is important not only when visionary companies prosper but also when they hit upon trouble. For example, when Ford faced a dire crisis in the 1980s, instead of just fighting fires, its management team stopped to discuss and clarify what the company stood for and how they could espouse the values of the founder, Henry Ford. Ford’s comparison company, General Motors, made no such effort. Though every visionary company studied had a core ideology, their content varied greatly. What counts is not the content of the ideology but rather that an authentic ideology exists and is rigorously acted upon.  Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. The real heart of what makes visionary companies so successful is that while they jealously guard the permanence of their core ideologies, the manifestations of that core ideology are always open for change and progress. For example, Wal-Mart’s drive to “exceed customer expectations” is a stable element of its core ideology, but the customer-greeters at the entrance to their stores are a practice that can change. Similarly, Boeing’s core ideology is to be a pioneer in the field of aviation, but building jumbo jets is a manifestation of that ideology that can change. This flexibility demonstrates how visionary companies refuse to abide by the so-called tyranny of the OR, whereby a company must choose between staying true to its core ideology or stimulating progress. Instead, visionary companies use the genius of the AND – experimenting and developing – while still adhering to their core ideologies. Visionary companies have their core ideologies to guide them, but they are also relentless in their efforts to continually improve their products, business and organization. They never settle and never become complacent. Consider the founder of the Marriott Corporation, J. Willard Marriot, who lived by the motto “Keep on being constructive, doing constructive things, until it’s time to die… make every day count, to the very end.” This sounds rather depressing, but is also a great commitment to constant progress. Just like their core ideologies, this drive for progress is innate and unquestioned in visionary companies. Progress is stimulated both by setting bold goals and by creating concrete mechanisms that encourage people to innovate and improve. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. To drive progress, visionary companies often set themselves extremely bold objectives – so-called big hairy audacious goals (BHAGs) – to which they commit utterly and completely. BHAGs are so ambitious that they often seem unrealistic, especially to outsiders. Nevertheless, they’re also clear and tangible enough to energize and focus the organization. A well-known example of a non-corporate BHAG is the one set by John F. Kennedy in 1961 when he proclaimed that the U.S. would take a man to the moon and back safely by the end of the decade. At the time, this was an almost ludicrously bold commitment, but it did get the U.S. moving vigorously forward. Boeing set many BHAGs during its history, including its commitment to developing the 747 jet. Boeing pursued this goal single-mindedly, without ever even considering the possibility of failure. The CEO stated that they would complete the jet even if it consumed the entire company, which it nearly did: at one stage roughly 86,000 people – some 60% of their workforce – were laid off as sales of the plane did not meet expectations. Similarly, Thomas J. Watson Sr., the founder of the Computer Tabulating Recording Company, set a BHAG by renaming his company – which sold coffee grinders and butcher scales – to reflect his ambition for global status. The new name was audacious at the time: International Business Machines (IBM). BHAGs often take on lives of their own. Just as the space program continued after Kennedy’s death, the visionary companies studied pursued their BHAGs even as new CEOs and directors came and went. Once a BHAG was achieved, new ones were set – always in line with the company’s core ideology. Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations pursue their core ideologies so single-mindedly that their corporate cultures are almost cult-like. For example, new employees quickly find themselves socializing primarily with their colleagues, and they are encouraged to be secretive about the inner workings of their companies. Employees often become completely immersed in the core ideology. Consider IBM, for example, where future managers in training would rise and sing songs from an IBM songbook: “March on with I.B.M., Work hand in hand…” Similarly, the Walt Disney Company expected its employees to live and breathe its core ideology of wholesome family fun. For example, men with facial hair were not accepted as employees at theme parks, and anyone heard uttering a four-letter word in the presence of Walt Disney himself was fired immediately – no exceptions. There is not much room in visionary companies for people who do not meet their tough expectations and standards. New employees often find that either they fit right in and thrive, or they perform poorly, are unhappy and exit the company quickly. In this regard, there are no compromises at visionary companies. Conversely, because the employees are confident and can be counted on to adhere to the company’s core ideology, they can also be given the leeway to experiment. This stimulates progress and enables the company to avoid the dangerous group-think endemic in many cults. Note though that visionary companies are not personality cults, centered around a charismatic CEO or founder but rather around the core ideology of the company. Though charismatic personalities can also drive passionate work, such “cults” invariably collapse when the person leaves. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave. While the visionary companies studied often had outstanding CEOs at their helm at one time or another, what was even more impressive was their ability to continually produce such high-quality leaders. The organizations focused hard on cultivating managerial talent within the company so that new leaders could be counted on to continue in line with the company’s core ideology. At the same time, visionary companies engaged in timely succession-planning to ensure continuity in leadership even if something unexpected were to happen. Consider for example the General Electric Company (GE), whose most famous CEO is without a doubt, the legendary Jack Welch. But actually thanks to the company’s fervent emphasis on internal management training and CEO succession, GE has enjoyed a century of Welch-caliber CEOs. In fact, more GE alumni have gone on to become executives of American corporations than the alumni of any other company. And Welch himself outlined his plan for succession seven years before retiring, though even this seems last-minute compared to Bob Galvin, the former CEO of Motorola, who began planning for the next generation a quarter-century before finally leaving. In contrast, the comparison companies often hired external CEOs who were unfamiliar with the company and who sometimes began steering it in new, wholly ill-conceived directions. Also, the CEOs at comparison companies were often near-tyrannical and engaged in very little succession planning, which left gaping holes in the companies’ leadership when they left. Some comparison companies even had CEOs who actively hindered succession planning and sabotaged would-be candidates. These companies then stumbled when the troublesome CEO finally left. Visionary companies produce a continual stream of high-caliber leaders. Charles Darwin discovered that evolution is a series of successful “experiments” in which slight variations are introduced to a species and the strongest new variants survive. Similarly, the visionary companies studied understood the need to stimulate a similar evolutionary progress within their businesses. They encouraged their employees and management to experiment with new ideas, products and practices, some of which became great successes. Consider for example J&J’s famous Band-Aids. They were born when an employee put together some surgical tape and gauze to quickly bandage his wife’s fingers after she accidentally cut herself with a kitchen knife. When he mentioned the idea to the J&J marketing department, they embraced it and eventually, Band-Aid products became the company’s best-selling category. Or consider 3M, which directed its employees to use 15 percent of their working time to work on any pet projects they felt like. Two such projects by two separate employees eventually collided to produce the famous Post-It Notes. This would never have happened if 3M hadn’t actively encouraged experimentation and allowed its employees to continue with their pet projects, even when early market studies were negative. Contrast this with 3M’s comparison company, Norton, which actually discouraged the pursuit of opportunities outside of its traditional product lines. One aspect of evolution is that some – or even most – variations fail; the same is true in business. J&J experienced some very prominent failures too, for example, its colored casts for children with bone fractures. The casts quickly turned hospital bed sheets into something resembling modern art and threw hospital laundries into chaos. Visionary companies understood that failed experiments are the necessary price to pay for evolution and must not be punished lest further experimentation be discouraged. Visionary companies stimulate evolutionary progress by encouraging experimentation. While many companies claim to adhere to idealistic values, encourage experimentation or embrace constant progress, very little is seen in practice. The visionary companies studied, on the other hand, managed to translate their values into reality by creating concrete mechanisms that affected the daily lives and decisions of employees. 3M did not merely say, “We want our employees to be more innovative.” Instead, it implemented several mechanisms to encourage this idea, one example was allowing employees to use 15 percent of their time on pet projects and dictating that 30 percent of each division’s annual sales must come from products less than four years old. Likewise, visionary companies did not merely talk about constant improvement; rather, they created mechanisms to ensure it. Wal-Mart, for example, spurred constant growth with so-called “Beat Yesterday” ledgers, which were used to compare each day’s sales to those of the year prior. Similarly, Hewlett-Packard instituted a grueling process of ranking its employees annually to stop those who gained a high status from just coasting. The visionary companies also took concrete actions in the long run. They invested far more than comparison companies in creating new technologies and business practices, training and developing their human capital, as well as in supporting research and development. For example, when Merck wanted to become a force in medical research, it deliberately modeled its labs on academic ones and allowed its researchers to publish their findings in academic journals – very unusual for private companies at the time. It also decided the product-development process should be driven by research rather than marketing as it was in many other companies. This attracted top scientists to Merck’s labs. Visionary companies don’t just talk – they take concrete actions to implement their values. The key message in this book: Visionary companies are able to attain their phenomenal success by staying true to their core ideologies while still relentlessly pursuing progress. A company’s core ideology comprises its core values but also its purpose, meaning the reason it exists beyond profits or shareholder value. To supplement their core ideology, visionary companies also stimulate constant progress by setting bold goals and by instituting grassroots mechanisms to realize their policies. The questions this book answered: Why should we study visionary companies? Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. What are the main principles that visionary companies use to thrive? Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. What are the specific policies and mechanisms that visionary companies use to preserve their core ideology and yet stimulate progress? Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave. Visionary companies produce a continual stream of high-caliber leaders. Visionary companies stimulate evolutionary progress by encouraging experimentation. Visionary companies don’t just talk – they take concrete actions to implement their values.",

    "title": "Business Execution for RESULTS",
    "author": "Stephen Lynch",
    "summary": "It’s easy to come up with a grand, ambitious goal, like developing and marketing a new drug for the pharmaceutical industry or positioning yourself as a leading architect known throughout the world. Making it a reality, though, is a whole different ballgame. To attain your goal, you will likely have to work very long hours for a quite a few years. But even hard work does not always yield fruit. Start-ups often go bust after three to five years of continued efforts, while many dedicated business professionals end up spending long hours in the office without having anything to show for it in the end. This happens because success must be carefully planned. These blinks will show you that you’ll need short-term, intermediate and long-term goals, and also identify the right tools to reach your goals. You’ll also learn how to stay excited about big hairy audacious goals; how to recognize the best opportunities in your business environment; and how to create a focus for your company that will ensure its success. Have you heard the term Big Hairy Audacious Goals, or BHAGs? It was coined by Jerry I. Porras and Jim Collins in their book Built to Last. To qualify as a BHAG, a goal needs to meet four criteria: It needs to be very big, take years to accomplish, be a little bit elusive in terms of the best way to attain it and must be easy to identify if it’s been achieved or not. Consider Wal-Mart. Following World War II, the company’s founder, Sam Walton, set a remarkably bold goal; he wanted to turn his tiny variety store in Newport, Arkansas into the most profitable one in the entire state. Since he was primarily selling cheap T-shirts and fishing rods at the time, this was a pretty audacious goal. It also wasn’t something he could achieve in a matter of months, and it wasn’t immediately clear how he could set about doing it. Finally, in terms of verifying his potential accomplishment, it would be easy to check the size and profit of his growing business against other stores in Arkansas. By 1948, Walton had achieved his incredible vision – his store was the most profitable of any variety store in Arkansas. From there, he just kept setting goals and, decades down the line, by 2002, Wal-Mart had become the largest company on the face of the earth. So, do as Sam did and identify your own BHAG. But a BHAG is not necessarily about growing your company; it can also be related to a specific product or project. In 1934, Walt Disney set out to create the very first animated, feature-length film. No one in the industry believed in this bold project because animation was only considered suitable for short films. History proved them wrong. Disney reached his goal when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released in 1938. People loved it. And even though Disney’s original goal hadn’t been revenue, the film did generate massive returns. Next up, you’ll learn about two key concepts that are at the foundation of your business. Imagine your dream is to build a cathedral. To achieve this incredible goal, would you hire people who simply know how to lay bricks or people who are wholeheartedly committed to building a stunning architectural masterpiece. Probably the latter, right? After all, having a unifying purpose is essential to forging commitment and building a thriving business. This central motivation is called a core purpose and it’s key to reaching your goals. For instance, as an architect, your core purpose might be to beautify cities or to build environmentally sustainable houses. Simply put, your core purpose infuses your work with meaning, while gathering energy and solidifying commitments in the process. This is an important factor since the more committed a team is, the more likely they are to achieve extraordinary results. In fact, the employee research firm ISR found that companies with an engaged workforce are more productive and profitable overall. So, your core purpose is a fundamental aspect of achieving your stated goals, but so are your core values. These values constitute your company’s moral compass; they ensure consistent decision making and guide your hiring and firing practices. In other words, your core values dictate how your company operates. Say you run a taxi company. Your core values might be summed up by the phrase, the right route is the right route. Such a value will indicate that your team doesn’t take detours to jack up fares. By stating this up front, you’ll keep your team on solid moral footing and ensure that they are committed to making the right decisions. But your values will also guide who is on your team in the first place. If it turns out that an employee doesn’t believe in the values you stand for, it is clearly the right decision to let them go. Imagine you’ve invested every last drop of your ingenuity into creating a deli that only sells broccoli jam. Your business could be perfectly organized and seamlessly run, but it wouldn’t matter if nobody wants what you’re selling. So, how do you determine which products will sell? By scanning your environment with a PEST analysis. This acronym, which stands for Political, Economic, Social and Technological, is a tool to define external factors that will impact your industry. To begin with, consider political circumstances that might impact your business, both today and down the line. From there, ask yourself, given the political opportunities and threats you can identify, which strategies should you adopt to succeed both in the present day and the future? For instance, in the 1960s, Sam Walton analyzed the environment Wal-Mart was entering. He realized that the US government was making a number of infrastructural investments, one of which was the creation of more roads. He therefore knew that it would become easier for customers to reach his stores and that it was a good time to open new locations. Next, you should consider economic factors that’ll influence your business and ask yourself the same question about the economic climate as you did about the political one. Sam Walton remains a good example as, in the years following World War II, he saw the economy surging and knew it was an opportune time to launch a new business. From there, it’s essential to take into account social elements that’ll impact your company. To do so, consider how people, your employees and, in particular, your customers act and think. Ask questions like, is the population getting older or younger? When Walton was starting out, it was clear that more people were having children. He saw that the baby boom would eventually result in more potential customers and was another cue that the time was right to grow. Finally, consider technological changes that might occur and how they could affect your business. Which technologies are currently trending? If a new technology like, say, flying bicycles was to hit the market tomorrow, how would it affect your business? Now that you’ve asked the right questions and set the stage, you’re ready to make some bigger decisions – which is exactly what you’ll learn about next. If you want to stand out in a crowd, all you’ve got to do is dye your hair pink and spike it into a mohawk. But standing out in the world of business requires a bit more thought. To do so, you need to identify your value discipline, the thing that makes you different from the competition and guarantees you a leading role in your industry. There are three different value disciplines to choose from and it’s up to you to pick the one that fits you best. First, there’s operational excellence, which basically means that you have low costs. Second is product leadership, which is all about creating the newest and best products. And third, there’s customer intimacy, which implies that you produce solutions that are perfectly tailored to the problems your customers face. But regardless of which approach you choose, all three of these value disciplines should keep you focused on the unique difference that makes you stand out. Let’s return to Sam Walton. Back in the early 60s, he began building his empire and decided to focus on offering the low-cost option. Specifically, he made the decision to spend some of his own savings to be able to offer rock bottom prices to his customers. His goal was for Wal-Mart to be the store that everybody could afford; in the end, that’s exactly how the company differentiated itself and became such a resounding success. Then, once you’ve chosen your value discipline, you can use it to identify your core activities. These are the strategic actions you take to keep yourself on the path toward your goals. Imagine you decide to focus on low prices as Walton did. Other factors like product development and customer service will soon become less important, as they’re not essential to reaching your goals. Identifying this will allow you to deliberately allocate fewer resources to these unnecessary elements and instead focus on getting better deals from wholesalers to lower your retail prices. By doing so, you’ll be syncing your core activities with your value discipline. Now that you’ve got the basics in order, you’re ready to build the messages you need to bring in prospective customers and beat out the competition. You might be thinking, what’s a good goal to set for your business? Well, it’s actually a difficult question to answer, since words like “good” are quite abstract and can mean entirely different things to different people. This is precisely why it’s crucial to come up with concrete ways of measuring your business’s progress – and numerical targets are an ideal method. Numbers make progress more tangible and, therefore, easier to monitor. Say two of your targets in the coming years are to build two more branch offices and acquire ten more resellers. Once you’ve set such goals, you can track the numbers you’re putting up and have your whole team monitor the progress. But that’s not all. You’ll also need to identify your key performance indicators, or KPIs. These all-important markers of success keep track of performance in essential areas and help you predict financial success. For example, if you’re in the construction business and notice a correlation between higher numbers of proposals and an increase in income, you might want to track the number of building proposals you submit as a KPI. Or, if your industry is pharmaceutical sales, you might track the number of weekly physician's visits that your sales representatives make because you know it has been a key indicator of your business success in the past. By now you have some strong strategies for business success, but if you want to reach your BHAGs, you’ll need to be serious about maintaining progress. In that fight, losing focus and wasting time are your biggest enemies – so here are some tactics to overcome them: First, conducting meetings is central to maintaining forward momentum, as they establish a clear rhythm for your business. While the idea of holding many meetings can be daunting, in general, they give you time to pause and reassess your direction; these regular moments of reflection can quickly become essential to a thriving business. One meeting that’s particularly important is the quarterly strategic review. It should happen every three months to give your team the opportunity to look back on the work you did and assess the last quarter. It’s a time to consider what you’ve achieved, review new projects on the docket and take a look at any surprises that came up. By assessing all these factors, you can double-check that everything you’re doing is in line with your goals. From there, you can use this information to perform what’s called a SWOT Analysis, which is a convenient way to map the current status of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. For instance, one of your strengths might be an expert on your team, while a weakness could be your failure to make enough sales. An opportunity might be the bankruptcy of a key competitor, which opens the door for you to bring in more customers, and a threat might be a pending merger between companies that, together, could poach many of your customers. From there, you can use your quarterly review and SWOT analysis to plan for the future and choose the projects you’ll be launching in the next quarter. Imagine you identify a few threats and weaknesses during your SWOT analysis. It’s probably in your best interests to address these in the next quarter; then, once you’ve gone through damage control, you can look at which new projects you want to take on to stay on top of your overarching, ultimate goals. The key message in this book: Creating a successful business requires a winning strategy that enables you to set the right goals and actually reach them – but that’s easier said than done. To pick the right strategy, you’ll need to do some careful thinking and analysis first, after which you’ll have to monitor your progress carefully. Actionable Advice Involve your entire team in strategic research. When analyzing your business, including the PEST analysis, ask everyone in your team for their opinion. With more minds involved, it’ll be easier to identify the most important aspects in need of consideration and pin down a winning strategy. So involve everyone you can in this process and don’t go it alone – you might miss something important. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Can You Learn to be Lucky?",
    "author": "Karla Starr",
    "summary": "Life is full of lucky happenstance. Maybe you attend a heavy metal concert, strike up a conversation with a fellow fan, discover he’s an entrepreneur and, months later, find yourself working for his start-up. Or perhaps you feel exceedingly lucky to have sat next to Todd in lectures because he’s turned out to be the man of your dreams. But, in reality, a lot of these apparently lucky outcomes have totally predictable causes. For instance, sociability is a predictor of opportunity (you wouldn’t have landed that job had you been too shy to talk). Similarly, proximity is a predictor of acquaintanceship (you fell for Todd because you met him, not because he was the dreamiest guy in the lecture hall). You can’t control everything in life. But luck is often more predictable than you might think, and we can all adapt our behavior, prepare for randomness and nudge the system so it works in our favor. So let’s dive in and find out why lucky people are lucky, and how you can learn to be lucky yourself. In these blinks, you’ll learn how looking the part and making a good first impression will increase your luck; why figure skaters who perform last are more likely to win; and how to overcome your natural inhibition and be more confident and curious. You’ve doubtless heard someone account for a serendipitous event – be it a job opportunity, a promotion or a romantic encounter – by saying, “I was just in the right place at the right time.” Well, it turns out there is a lot of truth to this cliché. At the very least, the “right time” part is crucial. Counterintuitive as it might seem, luck often depends on coming last. In any situation where a number of people, objects or performances are judged against each other, being among the last to be judged increases your chances of success. For example, an analysis of European figure-skating championships between 1994 and 2004 found that the first skater to perform had a 3 percent chance of winning, whereas the final performer had a 14 percent chance. The same pattern has been found in everything from synchronized-swimming championships to the Eurovision Song Contest. Why is this? Well, the human brain is wired to work this way. It relies on context, on the information and emotions that are currently available to it. Just consider house hunting. The first properties you view will be judged against your ideals because your mind isn’t yet stocked with real-life examples of real estate to compare them to. But, over time, as you see more properties, your brain will receive information about what is actually out there. You’ll start to think, “Well, this house seems pretty good compared to the first nine I looked at.” House hunters viewing their first property never say, “This house is perfect! We’ll take it!” They wait until they’ve seen a number of houses before settling on one they like. In the same way, figure-skating judges are reluctant to award an early competitor a 5.9 or a 6 (the highest marks available) because this will make it impossible to give later competitors a higher mark. By the end, competitors are more likely to pick up those high marks, however, since the judges know there is no one else coming who could trump them. So going last is lucky. If you can choose a job interview slot, go last. Want to pick up that hot guy at the bar? Make your attempt late in the evening. A social psychologist named Robert Zajonc once ran an experiment in which he exposed Westerners to foreign characters – Chinese logograms, for example – and then asked them how much they liked each character. Overall, the participants favored those characters that they had seen most frequently. This experiment is a demonstration of the exposure effect, which predicts that people will like things they’re familiar with. This effect has an obvious evolutionary explanation. As Zajonc put it, “If it’s familiar, it hasn’t eaten you yet.” So we tend to like what we know, and, in general, we’re most familiar with whatever we regularly get physically close to. For instance, one classic study shows that the physical proximity of two police recruits during training classes is positively correlated with the likelihood of their later becoming friends. Another study reveals that school children sitting in the center of a classroom make more friends than those on the edges because their central location makes it easier for other students to talk to them. So if making connections doesn’t come easily to you, don’t linger on the edges of that party or networking event. Get into the thick of it! But merely being around other people isn’t sufficient to spark friendships or profitable business connections. You also need to look the part. That’s because people instinctively use first impressions as a guide to decision-making. A study once examined whether musicians’ appearances affected how they were assessed. Judges were shown a series of videotaped violin performances, each by a female artist. Some of the violinists wore short skirts and tight tops, while others wore formal concert dress. The trick was that each performance was dubbed with the same musical recording. Nonetheless, judges consistently rated those in formal concert dress to be more technically proficient. Other studies show that doctors can increase their trustworthiness ratings simply by putting on a white coat over their suit. We can’t help but use our gut feelings to guide our decision-making. Thanks to years of observation, we simply feel that doctors wearing white coats can be trusted and that violinists in formal concert dress are the real deal. More often than not, our estimation of a person’s trustworthiness is based on a lightning-fast mental assessment – a first impression. So, whether with your Linkedin profile, your clothes or the strength of your handshake, try to make that first impression a good one. It really does matter. Most of us can think of people we know who are beautiful and seem to find success with ease. We all have that good-looking friend who was the college quarterback, always got the girls and is now raking in millions at Goldman Sachs. Beautiful people simply seem to have all the luck. And, in truth, beautiful people do have a lot of luck because humans are predisposed to favor attractive people. Since we can’t directly assess the quality of someone’s genes, we tend to make guesses based on the information that is available. An attractive, symmetrical face and nice, shiny hair are indicative of solid genes, so we tend to prefer people who possess such qualities. Our brains seamlessly make a series of logical leaps – from “this person is beautiful” to “this person must have good genes” to “this person is likely to be smart and well-adjusted.” If you’re of the opinion that beauty is a cultural construction, consider this. According to multiple studies, people of different genders, cultures and races tend to agree on who's hot and who's not. What’s more, babies do, too. When shown two faces – one that’s stereotypically beautiful and one that’s stereotypically ugly – six-month-olds spend more time looking at the attractive face. So attractive people tend to be favored by others, which really does make them luckier. This starts at an early age. One study found that parents with attractive babies – as judged by other people – are found to be more nurturing toward their children than the parents of less genetically-blessed offspring. The beautiful get extra help throughout life. In one study, researchers left university applications in phone booths, as if they had been left there by accident. Some of the applications, which included photos and addresses, were from attractive applicants, while others were from plainer candidates. Significantly more applications were mailed back to the attractive students than to their plain counterparts.   So how can those of us who aren’t physically stunning improve our luck? Well, we have control over our clothes, how much time we spend at the gym and whether we use makeup, of course. However, getting too worked up about your appearance can cause poor self-esteem. And as we’ll see in the next blink, confidence is also important when it comes to luck. If you have the confidence to get up and talk to that cute guy across the bar, you’ll be more likely to get lucky than if you sit in the corner, nursing your mojito. Confidence is about focusing more on reward than risk. Now, our brain has both an activation system, which encourages us to do things based on potential reward, and an inhibition system, which uses stress and anxiety to stop us from doing things based on potential risk. When we shift from activation to inhibition, we go from “go and talk to him – you might get a date out of it!” to “you’ll only embarrass yourself – it’s time to accept that you’ll die alone.”   People who are able to push activation over inhibition are luckier because they are more likely to get into the situations – talking to potential partners, demanding a promotion – that create opportunities for luck. However, for many people, this switch is easier said than done. The world is full of hierarchies, and there is plenty of evidence that people’s behavior conforms to their perceived place in the hierarchy. Consider why the rich guy from a successful family tends to be outspoken and confident. Research shows that, in the first four years of life, a child born into a professionally successful family receives 560,000 more pieces of encouraging feedback than discouraging feedback. In contrast, a working-class child receives just 100,000 more. And if a baby is born into a family on welfare, it’ll receive 125,000 more discouragements than encouragements. Low standing in the social hierarchy can mean low confidence and, therefore, less luck. But it’s possible to escape this trap. Girls are often told that they are less good at math than boys, and studies of women often find worse math results than for men. In one study, however, women about to take a math test were told to imagine themselves as “a stereotypical male.” This caused discrepancies in male and female performance to almost disappear completely. The women’s newfound confidence resulted in an obvious increase in mathematical ability.    If you’re naturally confident, lucky you! If not, here’s a trick that can help. Students who wrote for 15 minutes about one of their strengths – independence, say, or creativity – went on to perform better, over the course of a year, than a control group. Take time to remind yourself of your strengths. You got this! A Swedish psychologist named Karl Anders Ericsson once found that the world’s best musicians had, on average, practiced for 10,000 hours. This has led to a rather simplistic idea that’s been popularized by the writer Malcolm Gladwell – that you can become an expert in any field by practicing for 10,000 hours or more. It’s a seductive theory. You, too, could have been a world-class performer, if you’d only stuck with those oboe lessons instead of drinking Pinot Grigio with your friends! But it’s not really true. Hard work and practice aren’t enough. You also need the right genes. Researchers exploring the link between genes and athletic performance have found that genes can account for anywhere between 31 and 85 percent of variation between athletes. So the difference between an Olympic medalist and an “also ran” doesn’t depend on practice alone; it’s also genetic. You need the right resources, too, not to mention the right location. It’s entirely possible that someone with the perfect genetic makeup for competitive skiing is living in a favela in Brazil. Of course, that person would be unlikely to ever hit the Winter Olympic Games, for geographical and financial reasons. Studies of top swimmers show that they tend to come from families with a decent income. If they didn’t, they’d be unable to travel around to competitions. They also tend to come from places like southern California, where the sun shines all year round and there are plenty of pools. To add to genes, resources and location, you also need mental toughness. Reaching the very top in any field depends on never saying, “I quit.” The likes of Tom Brady, a superstar quarterback, are capable of looking at a loss and criticism as a learning experience time and time again, relentlessly focusing on improvement and exercising unyielding self-control. Master this, and you’ll be that much closer to becoming a five-time Super Bowl winner. It’s easy to believe in hard work. A gold medalist is more likely to talk about her years of training than her superior genetic makeup, and she may neglect to mention that she grew up next door to a track and was raised by parents who paid for exclusive coaching. Sure, hard work is important. But it’s not enough on its own. How do you spend your downtime? Working tirelessly on a side project that, someday, may lead to major success? Or watching Netflix in your sweatpants? Self-control, and investing time and effort in activities that are only rewarding in the long-term, is a great way to generate successful, apparently lucky outcomes. Meet Derek Sivers. He’s a millionaire who set up a company called CD Baby back in the 1990s. Sivers had created a credit-card account to sell CDs of his own music. CD Baby was born when a friend asked him if he would help set up a website for independent bands to sell their CDs. The site was created over the course of a weekend and later sold at a value of $22 million. What luck! A chance conversation that led, decades later, to a multimillion-dollar payout! Except it wasn’t really luck. Among his friends, Sivers was known as “the robot.” He had a long attention span and was happy to block out the world and work nonstop for a weekend if he wanted to master a new skill. When, in 1993, he first heard of the internet, he didn’t just start exploring it; he taught himself HTML so he could create his own websites. Unfortunately, it’s hard to improve your ability to self-regulate your behavior, so don’t get too despondent if you struggle with willpower. Our brain finds it easier to do things that we’ve done many times before – that’s why adults who have tied a tie every morning for ten years can do it on autopilot. Doing things that don’t come naturally, like tying a tie for the very first time, or teaching yourself HTML instead of watching old episodes of Friends, requires us to use the most energy-demanding part of our brain, the prefrontal cortex. If learning new skills feels like hard work, that’s because it really is. The good news is that, though arduous, self-improvement isn’t impossible. We can all get better at self-discipline by employing tricks like physically moving short-term temptations away (no more cookies in the cupboard!) and picturing the eventual reward of long-term decisions (do I want another cocktail now, or a house in ten years?). So cultivate your self-discipline, and when a lucky opportunity pops up, you’ll be well placed to capitalize on it, just as Derek Sivers was. Who you know is more important than what you know. Yes, it’s a cliché but for a good reason as it contains an element of truth. You may be the best in the world at what you do, but if you don’t make the right social connections, you won’t get any lucky breaks. In 1989, sociologist Katherine Giuffre tried to get an idea of how social connections affected success by examining the people and relationships within the New York fine art photography scene. She found three groups. First, there were strugglers – people who were unsuccessful in their careers. Second, there was a group of photographers with stable, long-term connections with the same curators and artists. They were doing okay, but their careers weren’t taking off. And then there was the third group – successful photographers regularly receiving attention from major art journals. This group was different. Its members had more social ties and knew more people, who, in turn, knew still more people. In short, they had a huge network. Giuffre noted that a lot of art delivered by the first two groups was simply filtered out into obscurity. The art wasn’t necessarily worse – in some cases, it was mind-blowing – but the photographers lacked the right social connections to get ahead. So a fine art photographer who can strike up a positive, engaging conversation with anyone is more likely to get ahead, and the same goes for all of us. But most of us can’t effortlessly chat up a journalist at a gallery opening. We enter into social interactions with nervousness or inhibitions, or we misinterpret the meaningless gestures of our interlocutor. We see them cross their arms and interpret it as “stay away,” not simply “I forgot my sweater today.” This kind of caginess can easily inhibit real connections, so, to get around it, you should demonstrate expressive interest in other people. Make crystal clear that you are genuinely interested in the other person. Send unmistakably friendly signals, like smiles and leaning in, and make open, welcoming gestures. If you are unmistakably pleasurable to be around, people will open up and warm to you quickly. Remember that humans are social animals. Just as we’re hardwired to enjoy sex and food consumption, we’re instinctively drawn to friendly smiles and welcoming body language. Tony Hsieh’s first business failure came when he was nine years old. His business plan was simple. Acquire a box of worms. Let them reproduce. Sell the new worms for a profit. Sadly, his due diligence didn’t identify a risk: all the worms might escape, along with any prospect of profit (this happened). But Hsieh wasn’t deterred from an entrepreneurial life. He was relentlessly curious and loved to explore new opportunities. He started a newsletter as a child and sold advertising space. At Harvard, he learned about bartending and – less conventionally – how to milk cows. He turned a profit by buying McDonald’s burgers for $1 and reselling them in dorms for $3. Hsieh never set out to be CEO of an online shoe retailer. In fact, when an entrepreneur first pitched him the idea of Zappos, Hsieh demurred. He wasn’t particularly passionate about or interested in shoes. But, as ever, he was curious. The market opportunity intrigued him. And it’s good that it did, because, by 2008, Zappos was turning over $1 billion in sales. Eventually, Amazon acquired the company, making Hsieh a multimillionaire. Many people aren’t curious, and, as a result, they neither get nor take any shots at success. As we’ve seen, our default mental setting is to stick with the familiar. The unknown – for instance, turning up at a party where we don’t know anyone – often feels threatening. Our brain switches to inhibition mode and we do nothing. Being cautious, or curious, about new things is self-perpetuating. If you don’t go to that party, you are missing a chance to get better at handling new things, and your commitment to the status quo strengthens. If you do go to that party, perhaps you’ll meet someone new, who will invite you to another party, and then another, until you eventually meet someone special – your future spouse, perhaps, or a new friend or an entrepreneur with a great business idea. So try to recognize that while your brain’s default is to stick to the familiar, you can make the decision to do something new. And there are ways to make that easier. You can build your social network because friends often help us do new things. Or you can save money, so you have a cushion if you want to take some risks. Or you can reduce your stress levels and work on your confidence so that taking that leap into the unknown feels easier. Say yes to things. Stay curious. In the end, you might just get lucky. The key message in these blinks: Life often feels random, as though luck is what separates the best from the rest. And it’s true that many events are outside of our control. But when we start to understand how our brains work, and how invisible biases and patterns influence our behavior, we can learn how to be luckier. So do your best to position yourself for luck. Expand your social network, stay curious and say yes to new opportunities. Actionable advice: Maximize your lucky opportunities by regularly trying new things.   Try out and learn different activities as much as possible. Learn computer programming, study French or try out a new sport. Maybe you’ll stumble upon a world-class talent you never knew you had, or meet your next business partner in class. At worst, you’ll get a better idea of what you truly enjoy doing! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Case Interview Secrets",
    "author": "Victor Cheng",
    "summary": "Once you’ve passed through the eye of the needle and have been invited for an interview at your favorite consultancy, the time is ripe to consider how to become the successful candidate for the job. In most cases, a job interview at a consultancy is not just another job interview with an assortment of questions about your endeavors and prior experiences. You have to be ready to answer questions that can be both quantitative and qualitative, and that can take the form of a case, such as what’s the current market size for product X? And that’s where these blinks can make a big difference. They’ll help you get an overview of the different types of questions that you’re likely to encounter and, more importantly, how to answer them in order to get the job offer you’re looking for. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to perform complex arithmetic estimates, precisely and quickly; when proxies come in handy; and why you should expect that your interviewer might act somewhat aggressively. Have you ever gone for an interview at a major consulting firm? If so you’ll know that it won’t just be a conversation about your qualifications; rather, it will entail solving hands-on business cases. These are called case interviews and they tend to feature quantitative questions that come in two types. The first is math questions – problems that involve some sort of arithmetic, percentage calculation or interpretation of data. An example of such a question would be, “if the total innovation capital of company A is X and it were to grow at five percent per year, which of the following is the minimum annual growth of human capital necessary for the firm to represent more than half of total innovation capital within ten years?” Questions like this can be daunting. But the key is to answer them as quickly as possible, which takes lots of practice. No matter how much of a math whiz you are, your brain is a muscle that needs regular training to perform optimally. In fact, even candidates with PhDs in physics or the highest marks in college math classes can fail at these questions if they don’t practice enough. So, it’s essential to take on daily drills that improve your speed and confidence. But how? One way is to practice old interview questions. For instance, you can become faster by searching for the types of questions asked by firms like McKinsey or the Boston Consulting Group. By doing so, you’ll begin to “automate” your reasoning and be able to respond to such questions in a snap. But keep in mind that test questions are always changing, and it’s important to get the most recently administered tests so that you’re up to date. Now that you know about math questions it’s time to learn about the second style of quantitative questions: computational-level estimates. So what exactly is a computational question? It’s a problem wherein you’re given a few facts and tasked with using them to make estimates. Answering such problems successfully requires precise arithmetic using large numbers – no easy task. But as a matter of fact, performing complex mathematical equations in your head can be done precisely and quickly if you break them up. For instance, you might be asked: “You have a market of 3 million customers, assume a 15 percent market share and revenue of $200 per customer. What is your total revenue?” To break this down you could first find the total value of the market, which is 3 million buyers x $200 = $600 million. Then, to calculate 15 percent of 600 million, you can break the 15 percent into 10 percent and 5 percent to find that 10 percent of 600 million = 60 million and 5 percent of 600 million = 30 million. Now all you’ve got to do is simple addition: 60 million + 30 million = 90 million. But arriving at an exact number isn’t always necessary. In fact, in many cases you’ll simply need to reach a rough estimate, and you can do so by cleverly rounding numbers. This is helpful because rough estimations will let you perform equations much more quickly. So, take a variation of the above question in which the market is 42 million customers, the market share is 12.7 percent and revenue is still $200 per buyer. What’s the total revenue? Obviously, there’s no way to arrive at a precise answer rapidly in your head, and this is where precise estimates come into play: Begin by rounding 42 million buyers to 40 million. Then, round 12.7 percent up to 15 percent. It’s important that you round this number up to counterbalance your rounding down to 40 million. Now you can just solve the problem like before to come up with $1.2 billion in revenue, a close approximation of the precise answer of $1.07 billion. So, rounding can help you solve complex math problems easily – but what about determining a product’s market size? It’s a piece of cake, and here’s how: First, remember that the purpose of such questions is to see how you approach them. In fact, arriving at the correct answer is more or less irrelevant. With that in mind, your next move is to find proxies, that is, other factors that can help you arrive at your answer. Say you’re asked the question, how many hamburgers does the average drive-thru sell per day? In this case, your proxies will be things that help you calculate hamburger sales. For instance, your initial proxies might be the number of cars that visit the establishment daily and the average number of burgers each car orders. But once you’ve found your proxies, it’s important that you carefully identify and keep in mind their limits; after all, a proxy is merely a rough estimate to guide your prediction. For instance, during peak hours, it might be that the drive-in can’t serve all its potential customers. It’s essential to account for this imperfection and break sales into peak and off-peak times. During peak times, sales are limited by the number of hamburgers the staff can churn out; to determine this, you need further proxies like the number of counters and the average time an order takes. But for off-peak times, your calculations will only depend on the number of cars and the average size of their purchase. For example, say you make the following assumptions: every day has four peak hours and eight off-peak hours. A hundred cars pass through during every peak hour and 30 cars visit the establishment during every off-peak hour. The drive-in has two counters and each car takes three minutes to make the average purchase of two hamburgers. Therefore, all off-peak customers can be served given the shop’s 40 car per hour capacity. Given these assumptions, you can determine off-peak sales by multiplying 8 hours x 30 cars x 2 hamburgers per car = 480 hamburgers per day. Then you can find peak hour sales by multiplying 40 cars x 2 hamburgers per car = 320 hamburgers, which brings the daily total to 800. If you find yourself at a case interview, you might be confused as to why interviewers ask you to make so many obscure estimations. How could somebody possibly determine how many hamburgers a drive-thru sells? Interviewers test prospective employees with these kinds of questions to simulate what clients will ask you if you become a consultant. In essence, case interviews are test runs for your future job as a consultant – and you ought to act like it. To do so, you need to know what your interviewers are looking for and why they ask the questions they do. For instance, if you know someone who has already had an interview at a big consultancy, they might have mentioned that the interviewers can be aggressive at times, constantly asking you to make estimations. Why? Because that’s what clients do. As such, the best way to approach an interview is to think of the interviewer as a client and yourself a professional consultant. Simply answer the questions as you would to best represent your company’s reputation. But consultants don’t just need the ability to answer questions with laser precision and demonstrate strong analytical skills. They also need top-notch interpersonal skills. In fact, even if you answer a question perfectly, if you’re nervous and fidgety you likely won’t get the job. Clients simply won’t trust recommendations from a nervous consultant. Say a consultant advises a client to let go of 3,000 employees while the consultant himself is sweating and shaking. Would the client really want to take this pivotal advice from such an anxious source? Probably not, which is why it’s crucial to emanate confidence. Now that you’ve found this important piece of the puzzle, you can easily approach case interview questions like “how can I boost my profits or turn around my failing business?” So, you’ve learned how to tackle quantitative questions. But your interviewer might also throw some general business questions your way, like “why am I losing money?” or “should we merge with this company?” Handling such questions is no problem as long as you utilize frameworks. For instance, you can use the profitability framework to conduct a quantitative analysis. It works by breaking profit into two groups based on its components: revenue and cost. Once you’ve done this you can do the mathematical operations one at a time to find the core of the problem. Say you are asked “why is the company losing money?” You simply break profit into revenue, the price per unit x the number of units sold, and cost, the cost of production per unit x units sold. You can even split the cost per unit into fixed and variable costs. By utilizing this framework you’ll be able to see the business quantitatively. Doing so might lead you to discover that the variable costs are too high, causing an increase in total cost and, therefore, decreasing profit. But figuring out that variable costs are too high isn’t much help if you don’t know why. To figure that out you’ll need the business situation framework. You can use this framework to analyze a client’s business, industry and market. It dissects these qualitative facets by uncovering information on four sub-segments of business: customers, product, company and competition. The first, customers, is about who buys the product and whether the base breaks into segments with different needs. When it comes to a product, you need to define what is being sold as well as how it’s packaged and produced. Defining the company means identifying its distribution channels, organizational structure and other relevant parts of the business. And finally, competition is about how much market share competitors hold and whether they’re doing things that your client’s company isn’t. By applying this framework you might discover that your client’s firm has high costs because of, say, a new package design that is overly complicated and wastes lots of material and money. The key message in this book: Most interviews at consultancies break down into two types of questions: quantitative questions and cases. Keeping a few simple tricks in mind, you’ll be well prepared to tackle both of them and land your dream job at a major consultancy. Got feedback?

    "title": "Chaos Monkeys",
    "author": "Antonio Garcia Martinez",
    "summary": "The last few decades have witnessed the dizzying ascent of many companies in Silicon Valley, California. These companies are now among the most influential in the world; it would be hard to exaggerate the enormity of the role they play in the lives of most westerners. But, like many success stories, it’s not all rainbows and sunshine. A closer look at how these companies actually work reveals a stormier picture. In these blinks, you’ll find out why foreign workers for tech companies put up with really bad conditions; how Google has left most of the work to non-humans; and why being smart isn’t necessarily the most important thing for Silicon Valley success. When Europeans were trying to reach America in the eighteenth century, many paid for their passage by submitting to several years of indentured servitude. While tech geeks seeking work in twenty-first century America don’t have it quite that bad, they still face a pretty rough deal. Being allowed to work in Silicon Valley isn’t easy for an immigrant, and the process often leads to exploitation. One solution is to obtain an H-1B visa: a nonimmigrant visa for foreign workers. However, only a limited number of these are available. In 2013, 200,000 foreign workers hoping for employment in Silicon Valley applied for an H-1B visa, but only 16,000 were approved. And the ones lucky enough to be approved are then totally at the mercy of their boss. If they’re fired or the company shuts down, their visa is no longer valid, a state of insecurity that often results in their feeling forced to accept a smaller salary than their American colleagues. As a result, the corporations are the big winners. They get highly skilled employees who will work for less, and these employees have to endure five years of this exploitation before they can apply for a green card, which gives them better rights and permanent-residence status. It’s no surprise that immigrants want to avoid all this. And the easiest way to do that is with a fake marriage. The US immigration system is friendlier with those who are trying to start a family. In fact, immediate-relative or family-preference visas account for two thirds of all successful immigration applicants. Surprisingly, for this method to work, you don’t even have to marry an American citizen. Stanis Argyris is a Greek computer specialist who wanted to join the author’s start-up team in 2008. So Argyris married a Turkish woman who, under a student visa, was studying at Stanford University. Now Argyris could obtain a student-spouse visa, stay in the country and finally work at the author’s company. Sure, life would be a lot easier if you could print your own money. But since this is a highly punishable crime, the next best thing would be to create a company like Google. One of Silicon Valley’s greatest success stories, Google is a sensational money-making machine. Every year, Google generates around $70 billion in revenue, a number so staggeringly large that you might be wondering, “How can a search engine generate that much cash?” For starters, it offers answers to many of life’s pressing questions, from “What’s the best camera under $300?” to “Who’s a good divorce lawyer in the area?” But Google also generates ads for companies related to your searches – and earns money every time someone clicks on one. The amount of money Google earns from a given click depends on the keyword being used and how many companies are bidding on it. A popular one like “insurance” can be worth as much as $54 per click. Perhaps even more remarkable is that Google hardly breaks a sweat dealing with all the bidding companies since they have an ingenious way of letting computers do the work for them. This, of course, makes good sense. There are billions of different keywords people search for, and figuring out how to sell individual ad space for each one would be virtually impossible. To solve this problem, Google holds an automated, instantaneous and lightning-quick auction. It starts the moment a search is initiated: Google’s computers quickly scan through all the pre-placed bids that advertising companies have made for this keyword. When this happens, two things are being taken into consideration: the highest bids and who has the best chance of being clicked on. The ad that best combines these two criteria will be featured at the top of the search results. This is why multiple searches for the same term might produce different results. If you search for “London Furniture” today, the winning bid might go to the handcrafted furniture company Swoon Editions; next week, however, it might go to the luxury furniture providers Unum Design. If you’re a thrill-seeker looking for a risky adventure, you might try bungee jumping or whitewater rafting. Or you could evade travel and the risk to your body by investing in a start-up. Chances are, you won’t have any trouble finding an opportunity, since start-ups are always looking for risk-friendly investors. A start-up begins its search for funding with what’s called a seed round. This is when the company’s entrepreneurs collect money from friends and family, while hoping to land big-time investors. These early investors are in a risky position for two reasons: The company could either fail and they’ll never see their money again, or the company could become too successful and they’ll end up with a microscopic share. Let’s say a friend offers $100,000 in seed money, and that this original loan is turned into an equity investment after the company, which has done well, decides to go public. And let’s say the start-up is valued at $10 million: since 100,000 divided by 10 million equals 0.01, the friend who invested $100,000 would now be the proud owner of one percent of the company. Obviously, one percent isn’t a great outcome, so to help prevent the phantom of such scenarios from scaring off potential investors, start-ups offer special deals. One attractive offer is to place a cap, or a maximum amount, on the company’s valuation. This prevents an investor’s share from getting too small. Let’s return to the friend who invested $100,000, and say the company agreed to place a $3-million cap on their initial valuation. This would give the friend 3.3-percent ownership when the company launches. Even if the company were to eventually be valued at $100 million, the friend’s initial percentage would grow alongside the company. While this offer can make one risk seem less troublesome, the fact that the company can still fail remains an unavoidable concern. Many parents dream of having children who’ll grow up to be both successful and truly kind. These parents might not want their children to enter the start-up world. There, success is most definitely not the result of niceness. As we’ll see, both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs used rather ruthless methods on the path to riches. Coming from a wealthy Seattle family, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University before starting a small tech company called Microsoft in 1975. Around this time, some trusty connections at IBM told Gates that the computer giant was looking for a new operating system. And Gates knew a guy perfect for the job: the IT genius Gary Kildall. But to Gates’s surprise, Kildall refused to agree to the terms of IBM’s contract. This is when Gates stopped playing nice. Knowing Kildall was sitting on a gold mine, he had a Microsoft programmer copy Kildall’s operating system and rename it IBM’s Disk Operating System (DOS). After Gates registered the copyright under his own name, the innovative system, which made it possible for computer hardware to be interchangeable, became the property of Microsoft. Hence the well-known acronym: MS-DOS. As a result, both Kildall and IBM saw not a cent of the billions that began pouring Gates’s way. Steve Jobs was also known for his unkindness, even when he first started out. Jobs began as an unpopular employee at Atari, the company behind the table-tennis-like video game, Pong. In 1975, the company’s CEO, Nolan Bushnell, offered a reward of several thousand dollars to anyone who could create a single-player version of Pong. Eager to win, Steve Jobs enlisted the help of his friend Steve Wozniak, who could solve just about any technical problem. Jobs pushed hard until Wozniak finally cracked the problem. Jobs won the prize money. Then Jobs told Wozniak that the prize was only $700 – not a few thousand – and handed him just $350 for his troubles. Okay, so billionaire tech giants like Gates and Jobs also do have a reputation for being rather smart. But if you want to make it in the world of Silicon Valley, there are other qualities that trump intelligence. One of these qualities – perhaps the most important when launching a start-up – is obsessiveness. Before the author founded AdGrok, a start-up that optimizes GoogleAds, he was at the bottom of his PhD class, even having to retake a number of exams. He envied many of the computer programmers around him, people who were far brighter and more talented than he was. Though not as intelligent as some, Martinez was obsessive. And this is the quality that brought him success in Silicon Valley. While working on the AdGrok project, he was so focused that nothing else mattered. Life was simply one tech event or company retreat after another; he worked ridiculous hours each day; and he watched his daughters growing and changing on Skype rather than in person. Work eclipsed his life. He gave up family life. He gave up his hobbies. He stopped reading books and watching movies, and removed all distractions until AdGrok launched. It’s not a pleasant way to live, but Martinez was rewarded for his obsessiveness. In 2011, AdGrok was purchased by Twitter for over $10 million. Another extremely important quality that can help launch a start-up is a refusal to give up. Some people, like the author, develop this quality early on. Martinez attributes his success to having made it through a tough childhood that included a sadistic older sister, a bullying father and frequent schoolyard fights. By persevering through a harsh childhood, Martinez developed a never-give-up attitude that he later applied to the time he spent on the Wall Street trading floor and the endless challenges he faced during AdGrok’s launch. The kind of determination and will-to-win shown by Martinez is contagious. And, in the history of start-ups, there is perhaps no better example of an obsessively dedicated team rising to a challenge than what happened at Facebook’s headquarters in 2011. That was the year Google challenged Facebook’s status as the premier social platform with the launch of Google Plus. It was a serious challenge. Google had lost some of its most talented employees to the younger start-up, and now it was time to finally go on the offensive. Google already had many popular products, like Gmail and YouTube, that promoted Google Plus. And when it launched, its design, photo- sharing features and ad policies were all superior to Facebook’s. But Facebook wasn’t just going to roll over; their reaction was immediate and showed that the company had cultivated a loyal and dedicated team of employees. All they needed was the right motivation, and that’s exactly what their leader, Mark Zuckerberg, provided. Once he heard about Google Plus, he immediately put the company on “Lockdown,” ordering all employees to remain on-site and work 24/7 until the threat was neutralized. Zuckerberg isn’t a naturally gifted speaker, but to rally his employees, he rose to the occasion and delivered a rousing speech that demanded Facebook’s quality be improved in record time. For the climax of the speech, Zuckerberg quoted the Roman senator Cato the Elder by declaring, “Carthage must be destroyed!” Obviously, Google Plus was Carthage to Zuckerberg’s Rome. His employees responded. They turned the challenge into an event by whipping-up Roman costumes and posters and quickly redesigning Facebook’s functionality and photo-sharing options to be in line with Google Plus. So, in the end, Facebook’s customers saw little reason to leave. And Zuckerberg showed that a company with a loyal corporate culture eager for motivation can rise to the toughest challenges. Some of Facebook’s major battles have been widely reported on. But, behind the scenes, there is a constant series of skirmishes, and a team of employees who are always in the fray, protecting Facebook’s customers. If you have Facebook, you probably use it to keep in touch with friends and play games and stay abreast of current events. But you’re probably unaware that, while you’re checking out photos and chatting with pals, Facebook’s security team is shielding you from disturbing content. Online security is one of the biggest challenges for internet start-ups, and security teams must review all ads and be on the lookout for an array of online threats: scammers, sexual predators, pornographers and so on. Since this work is done largely in the shadows, it is a thankless job. It tends to be recognized only when something goes wrong or slips through the cracks, in which case the security is thrown to the wolves. In fact, most of the time people get angry about the work they do and call them out for censorship when they accidentally flag something like a breast-feeding photo. Since users often forget to show gratitude for the accurate and beneficial flagging of harmful content, and perhaps also to make up for their usual anonymity, Facebook’s security team created a Facebook group called Scalps@Facebook. Here, the photos and profiles of the criminals they have taken down are listed alongside a description of the crimes they’ve committed. But aside from this group page, there are good reasons for Facebook to keep the team’s work under wraps. The biggest reason is that if people knew the sordid details of all the many crimes and attempted crimes, it could very well deter people from using Facebook. Many users are already concerned about their online privacy and safety, and if they were notified of every sex offender and scammer that was caught on Facebook, they might think twice about using it. While the security team would be honored, parents would likely make sure their children stayed away altogether. In the end, it’s another example of the many exciting – and unsettling – things that are going on behind the scenes at Silicon Valley. The key message in this book: Silicon Valley can be a ruthless and competitive place. Yes, friends have been known to stab each other in the back to reach the next rung on the ladder of success, but Silicon Valley offers some fun and inspirational stories as well. For those willing to sacrifice everything for a shot at becoming the next start-up millionaire, Silicon Valley might be just the right place. Actionable advice Develop your grit.

    "title": "18 Minutes",
    "author": "Peter Bregman",
    "summary": "Do you sometimes find it difficult to concentrate? You’re not alone. With Facebook, Instagram and smartphones always with us, constantly beeping and buzzing, craving our attention, getting things done is tougher than ever. So how do you fight these distractions and find your focus again? First of all, you need to accept that you can’t do everything. Then you need to make sure that the goals you have are really yours. Then it’s time to get going. Luckily, there are some neat tips and tricks that will make it easier for you to succeed. And it doesn’t require a lot of time either. Just 18 minutes. In these blinks, you’ll learn what Gmail’s “undo send” function can teach you about life; what jelly can teach you about choice; and why you should embrace your quirks. Sometimes waking up in the morning and looking at your to-do list can be overwhelming. Finding enough time to take care of everything can be a daily struggle. But with the right plan and some focused attention you can be your most productive self. First, find your focus by pausing for a moment, reflecting on what needs to be done and finding the best and most fruitful course of action. This pause will also lead to you making fewer mistakes. Take Gmail’s “undo send” function, for example. This feature gives you five seconds to reconsider whether you might regret that email you just sent. And five seconds is all most people need to pause and realize they’ve made a mistake. Of course, it’s more productive to avoiding writing and sending that email in the first place. Our initial instincts are often emotional, and the part of our brain that controls our impulses needs those few extra seconds to take control and put us on the right path. So, before you take action, slow down and take a moment to consider and to avoid wasting time. This pause can train your mind for long term success. You can think of life in terms of a marathon: It requires constant effort and endurance. Marathon runners gain endurance by breaking their week into four days of short runs, one day of a long run and two days of rest. And just like these runners you need this rest to reflect and put things in perspective. Pausing also allows you to think in new ways, leading to new possibilities. Without that break you’ll be on constant autopilot, acting out according to your idea of how things are supposed to be. This is the kind of behavior that leads to mistakes and missed opportunities. When you pause it gives your mind the chance to calm down, see things accurately and recognize the possibilities for productivity. So take the important first step and pause. Are you so ambitious you don’t know where to start? To find the best option for you, try to organize your life and focus on the things that matter most. Ask yourself what you want to accomplish in a day, week, year or lifetime. To attain these goals, you will need direction, and the key to getting on the right path is limiting your choices and taking advantage of your strengths. It is easier to take action when there are fewer options from which to choose. A simple way to narrow your options is to focus your attention on the things you are good at and work toward those talents and strengths. This can be a formula for being strategic about the things to which you dedicate your time and energy. Use this method to focus on approximately five things that will make a difference in your life. It might be improving your social life, being a better parent or launching a new product. By devoting 95 percent of your time to these goals, you’ll be directing your time and energy in the best possible way. Focusing on your strengths doesn’t mean ignoring your weaknesses. It is actually a good idea to embrace them! For example, say that one of your weaknesses is that you look at issues in very black-and-white terms. The author’s friend turned this weakness into an advantage by working on the issue of health reform. By not getting bogged down in unproductive arguments over gray areas, he used his stance of “I am right, you are wrong,” as a source of power to move things forward and excel at his job. So, when you are looking for direction in your life and choosing what to work on for the next day or year, take into consideration your strengths and weaknesses. You’ll be on your way to getting the right things done. Have you ever considered what makes you different and unique as a disadvantage? Don’t! It is a competitive advantage to be different from the rest! Today’s marketplace is crowded and people have more options than ever from which to choose. From bars and restaurants to technological gadgets and mobile applications, it’s the ones that offer something unique and different that stand out and succeed. If you are wondering what kind of successful project to work on for the next year, focus on the ones that have that special feature and stand out from the rest. Often times these differences can lead us to pursue our passion. It’s much easier and more enjoyable to spend time on things we are passionate about. It can take a lot of time to master something or perfect a certain skill, so it’s wise to turn your attention to something about which you’re passionate. Take learning an instrument, for example. A study at the Berlin Academy of Music revealed that it takes 8,000 hours of training to become a professional violinist. Those hours will go by much more quickly if you love what you are doing. But to be successful you have to avoid the pitfalls along the way. One common pitfall is the tendency to give up after a failure or misstep. Don’t fall into this one! Instead, pick yourself up and look at a failure as a chance to learn from your mistakes and make improvements. Another pitfall involves being paralyzed by uncertainty about the future. In reality, no one knows what the future holds – even a winning lottery ticket might turn into a future disaster! It’s better to focus on the present and creating your opportunities. So, now that you know what to look for – and what to avoid – it’s time to follow the plan. To follow through on a plan, you have to spend your time wisely. And to do that you need to have a system to keep you focused and on track. Luckily, there’s a simple 18-minute ritual you can follow every day. First, put aside five minutes in the morning to go over your plan for the day. In addition to things you would like to do, create an “ignore list” of things to avoid. This will help you navigate the work day and stay on target. For example, if one of your goals is to become a better parent, today you might decide to avoid seeking the advice of other parents and instead focus on listening to your child. Scheduling is a useful tool for getting things done. And this doesn’t mean saying, “I’ll get to it tomorrow.” Studies have shown that people are more likely to accomplish a task when they set a very specific time and place. Of course, sometimes things don’t go according to plan and you’ll need to reschedule. But don’t postpone things for more than three days. Try to find time later that same day or sometime soon, and if it still doesn’t get done it might be best to let it go. The next step is to give yourself a one minute pause every hour during the day. It’s easy to get overwhelmed at some point and lose your focus. In order to stay on track, take a short pause every hour to reflect on the progress you’ve made and what lies ahead. Afterward, you’ll be refocused and reenergized. The final step is to take five minutes at the end of the day to review. This is time to think about what did and didn’t work over the course of the day. Remember, learning from mistakes as well as victories is key to long-term success. Now that you have the power of the 18-minute daily plan it’s time to be the boss of your distractions. So, even though you may have a plan in place and a daily ritual to help you stick to it, you might be asking, “What about all the daily distractions?” Defeating distraction isn’t easy, and often the hardest part of accomplishing a task is getting started. You might find that simply changing your environment will help keep you focused. It’s easy to get distracted if you’re looking at the exact same wall every single day. Simply rearranging the chairs in a conference room can help people stay sharp in meetings. Staying motivated is easier when you make accomplishing your tasks fun. Say you have a long-term project in front of you on which it’s intimidating to even get started. Try making a game out of it. Split the project up into different levels to ease the pressure and set up gradually increasing rewards for “beating” those levels. Setting clear boundaries is important for a distraction-free work zone. If you’re working from a closed office, make it clear to everyone, even your kids, that your privacy is to be respected. If you have a knock-first-before-entering policy or a set do-not-disturb time, make sure to keep it enforced or else it can run the risk of being only a suggestion. Sometimes we are our own worst distraction. Here’s a counterintuitive trick to help: distract yourself from your distractions! Often times you can resist temptations to snack or check Twitter by simply stopping and sidetracking yourself. This is similar to pausing and re-focusing yourself on the task at hand. Now that you’ve mastered your distractions, it’s time to start your plan. So here’s a final tip: Start off small, the rest will come naturally. The key message in this book: Don’t do what others are expecting or what seems necessary, do what is right for you. Look at your unique strengths, weaknesses and passions. Then plan your year and follow the ritual of 18 minutes to help you reach your goals and overcome the distractions in your way. Actionable advice: Celebrate and use failure instead of fearing it. Did you know Iceland is the happiest place on earth? That’s because Icelanders don’t stigmatize failures. And you shouldn’t either. By accepting and learning from your mistakes you will adopt a growth mind-set which can enable you to maximize your potential. Failure is inevitable but also educational. What to read next: Four Seconds, by Peter Bregman As you’ve just discovered, all you need is 18 minutes a day to keep on track with your goals and life plans. But, as valuable as this technique may be, you may still have moments when you feel overloaded or stressed. This is totally normal – but, unfortunately, in such moments it’s easier to act on impulse than to think rationally and carefully. In Four Seconds, you’ll learn how to control yourself in these moments of stress. If you pause briefly and focus on your breath, you’ll greatly improve your ability to make the right choice, even when the pressure is on. To discover more about how to maintain your composure, including why you should treat leadership like learning to ride a bike, head over to the blinks to Four Seconds. Got feedback?

    "title": "Big Mistakes",
    "author": "Michael Batnick",
    "summary": "Financial mistakes: we all make them. From overdue library fees to parking fines, our financial mishaps can be frustrating – but they rarely cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. And as it turns out, even the world’s most eminent investors miscalculate and end up deep in the red. Whether it’s overconfidence or an underperforming economy, it turns out the people we hold to be financial wizards are still just people too. Here, Michael Batnick takes a select few investors and runs us through their worst investments. What’s more, he shows that we’re in a privileged position – by learning from the best’s mistakes, we receive the benefit of their hard-won wisdom without the cost of heavy losses. In the following blinks, you’ll learn the name of the most influential book ever written on investment; how Warren Buffett lost over $400 million; and why Mark Twain should have stuck to writing. Humans naturally seek explanations for events in the world; neat little rules and tidy formulas that package things up into clear explanations. Unfortunately, the world is far too complex for this to really work – and as the legendary investor Benjamin Graham demonstrated, this is particularly true with investment. Graham had a wildly successful financial career and authored the most influential investment book of all time: The Intelligent Investor, which was deemed “the best book on investing ever written” by the legendary Warren Buffett. But Graham’s most important act was pioneering a powerful new financial technique called value investing. And at the heart of this concept is Graham’s observation that the price of a company fluctuates more than its value. This means that the cost of a company’s shares – its price – often doesn’t reflect the company’s value, which is a combination of things like revenue, assets and future potential. So, why this difference between price and value? Well, it’s because humans set prices while businesses set values – and because humans are more fickle and emotional than businesses, price and value can vary considerably. For example, when Graham watched General Electric’s valuation plummet from $1.87 billion to $784 million in the 1930s, he noted that nothing disastrous had happened to the company’s assets, employees or revenue that year – it was simply investor optimism and pessimism driving these changes. But even Benjamin Graham couldn’t concoct a market-beating formula, and his philosophy almost ruined him during the Great Depression. After watching prices skyrocket during the 1920s, he sensed that prices and value were way out of sync. So, he decided to bet against the market, predicting prices would fall. And he was right – except he misjudged the extent of the fall. By 1930, the stock market had taken a beating. Assuming that the worst was over, Graham began to invest heavily once again. But prices kept falling, and the market wouldn’t truly bottom out until 1932; by that time, Graham’s portfolio had lost 70 percent of its value. Experiences like Graham’s prove there are no iron-clad laws in investing, and certainly no magic formula. Being aware of value is critical, but don’t be a slave to it. Cheap can always get cheaper. The famous investment maxim “buy low, sell high” has endured for a reason; it simplifies one of the most complex industries around with sound logic. But ironically, the man who coined it had an irrational appetite for risk. Jesse Livermore was born in Massachusetts in 1877. At 23, he moved to New York and secured a stockbroking job, where he made $50,000 in his first week. Things were going well, but soon Livermore made a fatal miscalculation – and it wouldn’t be his last. In 1901, Livermore shorted 1,000 shares of U.S. Steel and 1,000 shares of Santa Fe Railroad stock. In investor parlance, going short is the opposite of buying: you predict stock will decline from its current price, and aim to pocket the difference if it does. It’s a risky tactic; if shares increase in price, you’ll lose money. The price of Livermore’s shares rose. He lost around $50,000 on these two deals, his entire fortune. In fact, he was worse than broke: he owed his employers $500! But Jesse Livermore wasn’t finished yet. After working to repay his debt, Livermore returned to New York to start speculating again. The next few decades were a turbulent time, and the talented but flawed trader made and lost millions of dollars. Even so, the 1929 crash created the perfect environment for going short, which suited the naturally skeptical Livermore. Soon, he’d amassed a fortune that’d be worth $1.4 billion today. Livermore was one of the richest people in the world – but this would be his high-water mark. When the stock market reached its lowest in 1932, it had fallen to such an extreme that a corrective bounce seemed likely. In fact, days later it experienced its greatest bounce in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an important stock market index, surged 93 percent in 42 days. But there was a problem: Livermore had bet his capital on further losses. He was crushed. Days later, he decided to reverse his bets and hope stocks would rise further. They didn’t. After struggling in poverty for the next few years, Jesse Livermore committed suicide on November 29, 1940. Jesse Livermore is a go-to source for financial words of wisdom, but bankrupted himself multiple times by failing to manage his risk. So what’s the most important strategy to manage your risk? Diversification. Imagine you’ve got a nest egg tucked away. You know investing it is a risky business, but you want to give it a go anyway. You split your money between ten stocks, but soon one crashes to zero and you’ve lost 10 percent of your capital. But if you’d split your investment between 100 companies, you would’ve lost only one percent. This is diversification: a strategy the Sequoia Fund should’ve paid more attention to. One of the most successful investment firms of all time, Sequoia prefers long-term and large-scale investments. This preference for potent positions is the very opposite of diversification, but it has worked magnificently: a $10,000 investment into Sequoia in July 1970 would be worth $4 million today. But in 2010, the fund introduced shareholders to an ill-fated purchase: shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals. On April 28, 2010, Sequoia began purchasing shares in Valeant at $16. By the year’s end, the company’s price had ballooned by 70 percent. The next year was just as auspicious: Valeant gained 76 percent in the first quarter, becoming the fund’s largest holding. Things seemed rosy, but financial disaster was just around the corner. Sequoia described Valeant to its stakeholders as a company which cuts corners on research and development (R&D) but invests “heavily in its sales force.” This might sound like savvy cost-cutting, but the reality is far more crooked: Valeant skimped on R&D because its business model revolved around purchasing existing drugs and jacking up their prices. Just take Valeant’s 2013 purchase of Medicis – a company who invented a treatment for people exposed to lead poisoning. Before the acquisition, the drug cost healthcare providers $950. Overnight, the price rocketed to $27,000. Because of incidents like these, Valeant started receiving increasingly bad press. And when presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to prevent price gouging in the pharmaceutical industry, Valeant’s shares slid 31 percent. One month later, Citron Research published a report accusing Valeant of accounting fraud. Shares tumbled another 19 percent. The debacle was a disaster for Sequoia. Soon after, they sold their entire position – the fund’s biggest holding – and took a 90 percent loss. The company’s assets crashed from $9 billion to under $5 billion in the space of a few months. The lesson to take from this incident is that concentrated holdings can generate wealth quickly – and decimate it just as fast. Mark Twain is one of the great American novelists. He combined a sharp writing style with wry humor and an ability to convey great emotion. And, like many novelists, he put passion before logic in everything he did. In 1893, he wrote “when you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain.” Good advice, sure – but with such a visceral mind, it's hard to think of someone more unsuited to investing. Yet that's exactly what he pursued in his spare time. Twain was constantly searching for the “next big thing” to revolutionize our lives. In his time, he ploughed his fortune into many non-starters – but was particularly infatuated with inventors and their devices. For example, in the 1870s the author “invested” $42,000 – around $953,000 in today’s money – into a new technological process called a kaolotype. Charles Sneider, the inventor, claimed it would change the illustration and engraving industry by streamlining the process, and Twain was convinced. He put Sneider on a salary, and even funded a workshop in Manhattan without any agreement on deadlines. But the kaolotype was ineffectual, Sneider dishonest, and Twain didn’t receive a penny back from the episode. Twain’s biggest blunder was yet to come. Sore over his mounting losses and bitter toward inventors, Twain passed on a golden opportunity: the telephone. Twain was invited by his friend, General Joseph Roswell, to hear a pitch from a young inventor named Alexander Graham Bell. According to Twain, Bell gave a moving pitch filled with passion for his new product – but he still declined. Twain said he “didn’t want anything more to do with wildcat speculation.” At this, Bell even offered Twain the stock at a discount price. Twain’s reply? He didn’t want the stock at any price! The trouble was that Twain was an emotional man and got attached to his investments. When they failed, he felt aggrieved – which then clouded his rational thinking for future investments. But what if Twain had set hard limits on what he was prepared to invest before signing on the dotted line? After all, a proven way to avoid rash decisions is to decide how much you’re willing to lose before you invest. This way, logic – not fear – drives your business decisions. As a schoolkid, did you ever take a test you were sure you’d fail, only to wind up with a decent grade? If so, you probably felt pretty good about your abilities, and maybe it even encouraged you to stop studying! One possibility you probably didn’t consider, though, is that it was an unusually easy test – just like how Jerry Tsai’s plaudits probably didn’t acknowledge that the 1960s was an easy decade for investments. Jerry Tsai was managing the firm Fidelity Capital Fund before he’d turned 30. He was a character who exuded confidence; finance’s hot prospect in the 1960s and the first celebrity fund manager. His aggressive investment style involved executing many lightning-fast trades – often instinctive and perfectly timed. Most importantly, though, he was effective: from 1958 to 1965, Tsai delivered Fidelity annual gains of 296 percent. He was hailed as a hero, and left Fidelity in 1965 to start his own fund: The Manhattan Fund. And from there, Tsai’s star kept on rising. The Manhattan Fund offered 2.5 million shares in its company to financial professionals – but Tsai’s reputation had spread beyond the world of finance. Demand was ten times greater than anticipated: the Manhattan Fund issued 27 million shares in total and raised $247 million in capital. It was the biggest offering ever for an investment company. This was a time of huge economic expansion: post-war austerity was over and many early tech companies were beginning to flourish. Between 1964 and 1968, the earnings of IBM and Xerox grew by 88 and 171 percent, respectively. Tsai himself was from a generation of investors who had only known extraordinary growth and affluence. In the 1960s stocks rose exponentially, and this gave Tsai an overinflated confidence in his own ability. But the 1969-1970 price plunge was just around the corner, and when it arrived, he was caught completely flat-footed. Just take the Manhattan Fund’s investment in National Student Marketing. Tsai bought $5 million worth of shares at $143 each and watched this tumble to just $3.50 seven months later. Tsai’s machine-gun style of investment wasn’t suited to recessions and their aftermaths – the new climate rewarded patient, long-term trades. In 1969, the Manhattan fund ranked 299th out of 305 funds, and investors left in droves. Tsai was playing an unwinnable game. He overestimated his personal ability in a time of great financial growth and paid the price when rapid trading became unprofitable. Remember: a rising tide raises all boats, so it’s a mistake to assume that yours is particularly buoyant! Imagine you’re at a soccer game. To heighten the drama, you decide to place a wager on the outcome. But it’s a tough call - both teams seem equally skilled. Once you place your bet, though, you instantly feel confident about your choice. Suddenly a fan approaches you, offering to buy your bet slip – for more than you wagered. Would you do it? Well, according to several psychologists, it’s unlikely you would. In a famous paper from 1991, academics Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler described what they called the endowment effect. This hypothesis argues that we ascribe more value to things simply because we own them. But it doesn’t mean our possessions are inherently appealing – it’s just harder to give them up. This illustrates two important points: first, objective thinking melts away when we own something; second, our confidence rises once we’ve made a decision. It’s then that we fall prey to overconfidence. Just ask Warren Buffett, perhaps the most famous investor of all time. Buffett has a stellar track record. Between 1957 and 1969, the “Oracle of Omaha” managed a partnership which returned gains of 2,610 percent. In 1972, Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, purchased See’s Candy for $30 million. Since then, it’s generated $1.9 billion in pretax revenue! By 1993, Buffett had a long list of success stories. He was flying high and oozing confidence – but his biggest mistake was around the corner. That year, Berkshire purchased the Dexter Shoe Company for $433 million. Dexter was an American-based manufacturer, and it had Buffett’s total confidence. He wrote to Berkshire shareholders “Dexter, I can assure you, needs no fixing: It is one of the best-managed companies Charlie and I have seen in our business lifetimes.” The legendary investor was so enamored of his new purchase that he failed to see the winds of change blowing through the industry. Just five years later, Dexter was in freefall. The rise of manufacturing powerhouses like China and Taiwan crippled the US domestic shoe market. By 1999, Dexter’s revenue had declined 18 percent. It ended its US shoe production in 2001, and Berkshire folded the company into its other shoe firms. Buffett had been on a run of successful deals and failed to be vigilant. Even the world’s best err. A chess game between two grand masters is a remarkable thing, a master class in grace, accuracy and timing. Grand masters employ elaborate techniques, of course, and above all they orchestrate their pieces to cover vulnerabilities and force errors from the opponent. Just as it is in chess, so it is in finance. The crucial idea is that professionals in any game rarely make unforced errors – their fate is usually sealed by errors that the situation forces upon them. In contrast, the outcome in contests of novices is determined by their own, avoidable mistakes. Novices shouldn’t focus on winning points – they should focus on not losing points. But even professionals are guilty of unforced errors sometimes. Consider Stanley Druckenmiller. After a successful career running his own investment fund, Duquesne Capital Management, Druckenmiller was appointed lead portfolio manager for George Soros’ Quantum Fund in 1988. Druckenmiller thrived there: in his first four years, annual growth never dipped below 24 percent, mostly due to his strong knowledge of the world economy and foreign currencies. However, in 1999, Druckenmiller ventured outside his zone of expertise and committed a string of unforced errors. Tech stock was beginning its meteoric rise that year. Druckenmiller, however, believed that they were overvalued. He was so sure of this that he bet $200 million of Quantum’s capital on a price decline – except this didn’t happen. Instead, these expensive stocks kept getting pricier, and soon the Quantum was down 18 percent for the year. Druckenmiller, deciding he was out of touch with the market, hired two young, tech-savvy employees and went back to his forte – foreign currencies. But he couldn’t stay away from tech stocks for long. After Druckenmiller made a major investment in the euro only to see it decline in value, he watched with envy as his new employees were still raking in cash from tech stocks. Not wanting to be upstaged, he invested $600 million in the networking company VeriSign. But the tech bubble was about to burst, and Druckenmiller would be left with a half-billion-dollar sized hole in his pocket. By May 2002, VeriSign was worth just 1.5 percent of its peak value. From neglecting his areas of expertise to allowing himself to succumb to the fear of missing out, Druckenmiller illustrated the danger of unforced errors and why we should focus on stamping them out rather than casting around for our big wins. Have you ever looked at the price history of Amazon stock? If so, you’ve probably kicked yourself for not realizing this sleeping giant would change the world. After all, an initial investment of $1,000 early on would have netted you $387,000 today! But such thinking is harmful and masks the superhuman nerve that would’ve been required to hold onto your Amazon stock. It was slashed in half on three separate occasions. And this doesn’t just happen to the financial layperson: short-term losses test the resolve of seasoned investors too, including people like Charlie Munger. Munger is best known as Warren Buffett’s long-time partner and the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. He has a formidable intellect that thrives on inverting questions and reverse engineering problems. This intelligence, along with his razor-sharp wit, have made him famous for his playful aphorisms, or “Mungerisms.” For example, “All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there.” But Munger’s genius didn’t save him from some financial nosedives. In 1974, he threw diversification to the wind and invested 61 percent of his fund into Blue Chip Stamps – a company producing loyalty tokens redeemable for consumer goods. But soon there was an economic downturn, and firms producing non-essential goods were devastated. Such a concentrated position was completely unadvisable, and this stake in Blue Chip was almost fatal: an investment of $1,000 in Charlie Munger’s company in January 1973 would have been worth just $467 in January 1975. Many investors were questioning his judgement, scrambling to cut their losses with him. But Charlie Munger wasn’t beaten yet, and neither was Blue Chip Stamps. Munger’s investment company posted gains of 73.2 percent by December 1975, and Blue Chip later purchased several companies which would become some of Berkshire’s prize assets: See’s Candies, Wesco Financial and the Buffalo Evening News. So, after a disastrous period in the mid-1970s, Munger bounced back stronger than ever. Ever since, he’s been a guiding light in one of the most successful investment companies of all time. Charlie Munger’s Blue Chip investment shows how crucial it is to exercise patience and composure when investing long-term. It’s common for portfolios to take massive hits due to external factors like the wider economy, and you must be able to insulate yourself from temporary large losses. Remember: the time not to sell your investments is in a panic after a drop in value. The key message in these blinks: Investing is a dangerous game – even for the most talented players. But by studying the greats and their greatest blunders, we can benefit from their mistakes without the million-dollar price tags. If you’re an amateur, you should focus on avoiding unforced errors rather than shooting for big wins, and if you do win, stifling overconfidence is crucial. Above all, don’t become attached to your assets: emotions like fear, anger, envy and greed are your portfolio’s worst nightmare. Actionable advice: Exercise due diligence and don’t over-trade. If you’re new to the world of stocks and shares, you should know that making too many trades is one of the most common errors. Like a true venture capitalist, you should exhaustively research every company you plan to invest in and don’t be afraid to walk away. Warren Buffett once suggested that investors should act like they are only permitted to make 20 trades in their entire career. This way, you exercise extreme caution and keep yourself focused on high-quality trades. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Black Edge",
    "author": "Sheelah Kolhatkar",
    "summary": "It’s common knowledge these days that Wall Street has a lot to answer for. After the events of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, one would hope that governments would crack down on the excesses at the heart of global finance. Sadly, that simply has not been the case, and the injustice of this state of affairs is perfectly personified by Steve Cohen, a Wall Street investor who made billions of dollars by attaining a “black edge” over fellow investors. Cohen procured illegal, or “black,” insider information about companies’ performances in order to gain an advantage over fellow investors. To the outside world, he was miraculously lucky, always betting on the right companies at the right time. In reality, as the investigative journalist Sheelah Kolhatkar discovered, he was almost certainly utilizing an unfair advantage to surpass his rivals. In these blinks, you’ll learn how the hedge fund Cohen founded systematically used illegal insider information to manipulate stock prices; how a drug to help Alzheimer's patients made Cohen $273 million; and why, after multiple criminal proceedings, Cohen has managed to remain a free man. In 2008, in the midst of the worldwide financial crisis, US federal agents were in the process of taking down Raj Rajaratnam, a Wall Street titan, when they discovered something fascinating. Rajaratnam was illegally using inside information from companies; he traded on this information and profited from it massively. The agents were intrigued at how one name kept cropping up during interviews with Wall Street insiders: Steve Cohen. Was there an even larger case waiting to be uncovered? Rajaratnam, it turned out, was small fry – the investigation was only just getting started. So who is Steve Cohen? Let’s start from the beginning. Steve Cohen was born in 1956 and grew up in a middle-class family on Long Island, New York. From a young age, he was fascinated with finance. As a student at the famous Wharton School at the University of Philadelphia, he read the Wall Street Journal every morning and followed the stock market. He was talented too: he played poker with his fellow students and made a lot of money doing so. In 1978, fresh out of Wharton as a 21-year-old, he landed a job at Gruntal & Co., a New York brokerage firm. Even then, his skills shone through: in one afternoon, he made $4,000, a huge figure in 1978. Cohen was successful, making $5 million to $10 million a year. But it didn’t take long for the first signs of wrongdoing to appear as he faced charges of insider trading. In 1985, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, looked into Cohen’s transactions. Cohen had received inside information through a friend about an imminent takeover of electronics company RCA by General Electric. Cohen invested heavily in RCA shares and made $20 million in profits when the takeover was announced. Even though the criminal case was later dropped, it strongly indicated Cohen had a somewhat unorthodox approach to trading. Within 14 years, Cohen moved from being a lowly junior trader to a revered Wall Street personality. It would only be a matter of time before he wished to break free of Gruntal and venture out on his own. So it was that in 1992, Cohen founded his own investment firm, SAC Capital Advisors, using his own initials for the company name. It was a hedge fund that profited by investing money gathered from different individuals and institutions. Cohen began with $23 million and nine employees, and met with astronomical success. In just three years, SAC had quadrupled in size to $100 million. After that, SAC doubled each year, surpassing $1 billion in assets by 1999. Cohen’s pockets were overflowing. But just how did he manage to make so much so quickly? Cohen bet on short-term movements in stock prices. Each day, he gathered information about the market, bought large numbers of shares and then sold them when their price rose. But it eventually became more complicated than that. In fact, SAC systematically attempted to receive and trade on inside information. By the late 90s, SAC was finding it more difficult to profit from short-term trading, and Cohen sensed that things needed to be turned up a notch. Until that point, his traders were unaware of the industries or companies whose shares they were trading. In response, Cohen started to hire traders with a “fundamental edge,” that is, traders with deep knowledge, expertise or personal connections in a particular industry. SAC wanted people who knew and would reveal valuable intelligence – in other words, inside information. For instance, if a potential hire lived in the same neighborhood as an industry executive, this was a bonus. Such “coincidences” would be opportunities for making personal connections. Every possible connection was mined in a bid to build up profits. By the mid-2000s, Cohen was one of the richest men in the world. He had a personal fortune of nearly $10 billion. He allowed himself a few luxuries with this cash, and often splurged on expensive artwork. But something seemed off. SAC’s huge profits seemed just too good to be true, and there simply had to be something shady going on. It was no surprise to anyone, then, when, in 2006, SAC Capital was accused of manipulating stock prices. The first to point fingers were Biovail, a Canadian drug manufacturer, and Fairfax, a Canadian insurance company. They accused SAC of spreading false and negative reports about their performance and business practices, which in turn caused their stock prices to drop. Traders at SAC were able to make huge profits when they bet against these companies’ success. For instance, Fairfax employees claimed to have received nighttime calls from anonymous voices that whispered that Fairfax was fraudulent. Additionally, anonymous websites appeared making comparisons between Fairfax and Enron, a firm which had itself collapsed after massive fraud revelations. The accusations were all unfounded, but they were still noticed by the regulatory authorities, the SEC and the FBI. Simultaneously, at SAC, the shady culture that purposefully sought inside information continued. SAC’s approach was to bet on short-term stock-price movements, especially of the type that occur after specific events, such as companies' profit announcements. SAC managers pushed their traders to talk to their contacts and leverage them to get relevant information before any official announcements. A favored way to get valuable information was using so-called expert networks, such as Gerson Lehrman Group. These networks are designed to connect investors with company executives. Technically, in these paid-for “consultations,” the executives can't share inside information. However, they did drop valuable hints, and the information flowed back to SAC traders. Needless to say, they put this knowledge to good use. Almost 5 million people have Alzheimer’s disease in the United States alone. The disease causes severe memory loss and, unfortunately, no effective treatment has been discovered. A breakthrough in this regard could potentially result in millions of dollars in profits, so any development is sure to attract Wall Street’s attention. When two pharmaceutical companies, Elan and Wyeth, tried to develop Alzheimer's medication in the 2000s, Mathew Martoma, an SAC trader, naturally wanted to learn more. The new drug was to be called Bapineuzumab, or Bapi for short. Martoma set about building strong relations with Dr. Sidney “Sid” Gilman, who was involved in bapi's development as chair of Elan's safety monitoring committee. He had also signed a confidentiality agreement related to all aspects of bapi’s development. Nonetheless, Martoma was very persuasive. The two spent hours on the phone and before long, Martoma had pushed Gilman into discussing the confidential bapi trials. It was this information, which Gilman eventually provided to Martoma, that SAC used to great effect. Thanks to the calls, Martoma was initially very confident that bapi would be successful. Therefore, Cohen and Martoma gathered more than $700 million in Elan and Wyeth stocks. The final bapi test results were due to be released on July 28, 2008, at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease in Chicago. Gilman was to be keynote speaker and one of a tiny circle of people who knew the highly confidential results in advance. Well, theoretically at least. He had also shown them to Martoma. Martoma realized that bapi was a dud as far as investment was concerned – it was suitable only for a small number of patients. Therefore, on July 20, Martoma called Cohen and they agreed to quietly disburden themselves of stock. They even started shorting stocks, meaning that they sold stocks before the prices dropped and then repurchased the stocks at a lower price. In doing so, they held onto the stocks but also took home the difference between their initial selling price and subsequent, lower purchase price. By the time the bapi results were officially released, Elan and Wyeth share prices had plummeted, making Martoma and Cohen a cool $276 million in the process. SAC’s business model was heavily and clearly based on insider trading. Even so, in the late 2000s, insider trading was common practice at Wall Street hedge funds. Unlike closely monitored big banks, the relatively new hedge funds operated below the radar of the regulators and could get away with murder. But that was soon to change. In 2009, the FBI began to investigate SAC’s obscure business practices in secret. In particular, the FBI were searching for suspicious trades – and their key target was Cohen himself. But their strategy was to approach implicated junior SAC analysts, then push them to provide evidence against their managers. The idea was that they would gradually gather evidence about higher-ranking traders until they finally got to Cohen himself. They soon found Jonathan Hollander, a former junior analyst at SAC and just what the FBI were after. He had traded stock in Albertsons, a supermarket chain, and a friend of his had leaked information to him about an impending takeover. Hollander was the FBI’s first link, and they hoped for a clear path to Cohen from there. But they found that Cohen had created a security mechanism to protect himself. He asked his analysts to rate potential trades on a scale from zero to ten, thereby ensuring that he wasn’t himself trading directly with inside information. At about the same time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started to investigate, too. They were looking into SAC’s spectacular success when trading the Elan and Wyeth stocks just prior to the announcement of the results of the bapi trials. It was suspicious to say the least. At that critical moment, on November 19, 2010, the Wall Street Journal published an article detailing the FBI’s and SEC’s investigations. The traders had been forewarned and became very alarmed, and quickly set about destroying their hard drives. The investigation's cover had been blown. Once the Wall Street Journal had revealed what the FBI and SEC were up to, the authorities had no choice but to move quickly. Otherwise, they ran the risk of Wall Street traders destroying all evidence of insider trading before they could get to it. Just a few months later, in May 2011, US authorities had their first breakthrough, and placed Mathew Martoma and Dr. Sidney Gilman on their suspect list. The SEC had identified Gilman as the putative bapi trial results leaker months earlier, but they remained unsure who his contact at SAC was. As a result, the SEC subpoenaed Gilman’s phone records, and eventually identified a mysterious phone number. It was Martoma's, one of the portfolio managers at SAC. The investigators also discovered that Martoma had contacted Cohen shortly before SAC sold off its Elan and Wyeth shares. On top of all that, Martoma was already on the FBI’s database as being “known to the Bureau.” They were closing in. Things unraveled quickly when they started digging on Martoma. For starters, Mathew Martoma wasn’t his real name – it was Ajai Thomas. They also found that, as Thomas, he'd had to leave Harvard Law School rather suddenly. In his second year of classes, Martoma had struggled to cope with course work. In an effort to get a coveted legal clerkship, he’d actually forged the grades on his transcript. It was after this that he’d changed his name. Not long after the FBI breakthrough, their agents confronted the pair at their respective homes, detailing their suspicions of insider trading. But Cohen remained the FBI's ultimate target, and they needed the pair to cooperate – they needed their help in getting the real dirt on Cohen. When, in 2011, FBI agents pulled up in front of Mathew Martoma’s house, they had strong suspicions but no actual evidence of insider trading. In those circumstances, all they could do was ask questions and chip away at his resolve. However, a year later, that had changed. This time, when the agents arrived for the second time, they weren't there to shoot the breeze. They arrested him on the spot. However, the FBI’s initial interrogation of Dr. Sidney Gilman and Mathew Martoma didn’t proceed so well. When asked about scientific details of the bapi trials, Gilman could recall every detail. But when it came to questions about his relationship to Martoma, he stonewalled investigators and said he couldn’t recall any details. Meanwhile, Martoma pled the Fifth Amendment so as not to incriminate himself; after all, he was facing a prison sentence of up to ten years. To investigators, Martoma’s move seemed odd, as he could easily have reduced his potential sentence if he implicated Cohen – but he didn’t. Possible factors could have been that Cohen was covering Martoma’s legal costs, or that Martoma feared retribution if he crossed Cohen. In August 2012, Gilman finally agreed to cooperate fully. He admitted that he had given Martoma inside information about the bapi test results. With that confession, the FBI had enough evidence to arrest Martoma. But they still couldn’t press charges on Cohen and SAC. Cohen, though, was aware of the danger. And so, in the spring of 2013, SAC agreed to fork out a record fine of over $600 million to settle the cases of insider trading. After all, from Cohen’s perspective, it made sense to settle before the situation worsened. And there was still the risk that Martoma would testify against him. All the legal issues would simply dissolve, he thought, if he wrote a check. But it wasn’t over yet. The SEC was still keen to charge Cohen himself. Finally, there was another development in the case. The SEC got their hands on an email that potentially connected Cohen to another case of insider trading at SAC. In the summer of 2008, Mike Steinberg, an SAC trader, received inside information about the computer company Dell’s disappointing business figures, which weren’t yet public. Steinberg used the information to bet that Dell’s stock price would drop, and when it did, he netted a cool $1.4 million. It was an email that Steinberg had sent to Cohen about this information that the SEC now had in its possession. Therefore, to settle this additional case, SAC agreed to pay a record fine of $1.2 billion in July 2013. The SEC’s ultimate aim was to use this information to convict Cohen of insider trading. After all, he had received Steinberg’s email and sold Dell stocks immediately afterward. However, Cohen’s lawyers were canny. They argued Cohen only read about ten percent of his 1,000 or so daily emails, and so had probably never seen the incriminating note. Because it wasn’t clear that he had acted on the email from Steinberg, convicting Cohen was difficult; it simply couldn’t be proven. At this point, since the SEC didn’t want their whole case to come crashing down, they dropped this line of inquiry. This main case was settled with SAC for another $1.2 billion. Soon after, in the fall of 2014, Mathew Martoma was sentenced to nine years in prison. He was repeatedly given the opportunity to cooperate and testify against Cohen since, in doing so, he could have reduced his sentence significantly. But he revealed nothing, and we still don't know why. Cohen, however, was himself never convicted. To rub salt into the wound, he has since made more money than ever before. In April 2014, he rebranded the tarnished SAC Capital Advisors brand as Point72 Asset Management and simply kept going. Despite their continuing investigations, US authorities have drawn a blank. Cohen walked away a very rich man indeed. In fact, in 2014, Cohen earned $2.5 billion. The key message in this book: Steve Cohen was, and remains, a gifted investor. But his investment firm, SAC Capital Advisors, was built on a business model that involved illegal insider trading. Some of Cohen’s traders were convicted of insider trading after years of investigation – but Cohen himself was never found guilty of any criminal charges. He continues to make billions of dollars and remains active in the financial sector.   Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Blockchain",
    "author": "Stephen P. Williams",
    "summary": "These days, everyone from finance gurus to conceptual artists is talking about blockchain. Initially devised as a platform for Bitcoin, blockchain went unnoticed for years until technologists realized that its potential far exceeds the realm of cryptocurrencies. Now, the hype around this new technology has amounted to some philosophers calling it the next enlightenment. But what exactly is blockchain? Simply put, blockchain is a digital ledger software that is unhackable and unchangeable. Its distributed technology offers an unprecedented amount of transparency and accountability that poses a threat to traditional intermediary authorities such as banks, businesses, and even governments. If that sounds confusing, don’t worry. In this these blinks, you’ll learn how the technology works, how it’s being applied to business, finance, climate change, and the arts, and what it could mean for the future of society. In these blinks, you’ll learn why blockchains become more secure as more people join them; how blockchain could lead to a fleet of autonomous self-driving cars; and why blockchain is giving people hope for a brighter future. If you look up the definition of blockchain, you’ll learn that it’s a digital ledger, or book in which accounts or monetary transactions are recorded. If that sounds boring, look at it this way: ledgers are the foundations of civilization. Without them, we wouldn’t have been able to build cities or efficient markets. They are the means by which we do everything from keeping track of our finances and demonstrating ownership of a house to verifying our status as citizens. For hundreds of years, the world economy has been based on a ledger system called double-entry bookkeeping. These ledgers have two columns for information: debit and credit. As long as the credit and the debit for a transaction match in both the buyer’s and the seller’s books, that transaction is error-free. In order to establish trust in the system and ensure that a transaction is true and accurate, double-entry accounting requires middlemen. Brokers, bankers or other intermediaries get a fee to certify the legitimacy of transactions. However, history has shown us that this system isn’t always reliable. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, it was revealed that many large corporations, like Enron and Lehman Brothers, had effectively been keeping extra sets of books, which they used to conceal the true nature of their financial operations. For years, these companies were able to manipulate the system to launder vast amounts of money. Ever since the dawn of the Internet, many have hoped that it would bring an end to these kinds of transgressions. But until now, the Internet’s susceptibility to hackers has posed security issues when it comes to large financial transactions. However, the blockchain might change all that. The blockchain was originally created as a platform for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. By tracking every purchase or sale, the blockchain ensures that a digital coin can never be spent twice. Transactions are all online for everyone to see; all you need to join is an Internet connection. In addition to credit and debit, the blockchain has a third column in its digital ledger: verification. This  eliminates the need for intermediaries. Instead, trust is built into the very system. Blockchain technology is already being developed in ways which might revolutionize everything from the way that artists can certify the provenance on their work to the way we value currencies such as the U.S. dollar. It could even eliminate the possibility of tampering or lost ballots when it comes to voting. But how can be sure that this technology is so trustworthy? That’s because unlike other ledgers, the blockchain is unhackable and unalterable. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how it actually works. Picture yourself gazing up into the sky on a clear night. Beams of light link each star to the next, forming a celestial network. That’s what a blockchain looks like: a network of phones, computers and other devices, forming a supercomputer that runs the blockchain. The blockchain system is secured through the construction of linked blocks that represent information. Say you want to record the number of rubber trees in the Amazon rainforest. The data would be entered into a digital collection called a “block.” After a block reaches its capacity it’s ready to be added to the chain of linked blocks, or the “blockchain.” However, before it can be added, the new block must be approved by every node – meaning every device linked to the chain – in a process known as the protocol. That's why blockchain is called a distributed technology: everyone on the chain has equal decision-making power. There are various protocol methods, but the most common one is called “proof of work.” With proof of work, every new block comes with a complex mathematical problem, which must be solved before the block can be added to the chain. This is done by special nodes called miners that compete to solve the problem in order to win Bitcoins. Thanks to proof of work, adding blocks to the chain requires substantial computational resources, which helps prevent malicious actors from manipulating the blockchain. Part of solving the problem generates a cryptographic hash, or a code made up of a long string of numbers and letters. In addition to its own hash, each block contains a timestamp as well as the hash from the previous block, aligning it with the rest of the blockchain. You might be wondering why it’s possible to mine Bitcoins, but not to hack into the blockchain and change a block’s information – to say that someone else’s Bitcoin actually belongs to you, for instance. That’s because changing a single block’s information would render the entire chain’s hashes out of sync and automatically signal a break-in. Not only would hackers have to change the hashes for every block in the chain, but they would also have to do this for every single node, since the blockchain is copied onto every node’s device. The computing power required to achieve such a task increases exponentially with every node added to the chain. In other words, the more nodes there are on a chain, the stronger the chain becomes. Unless you’re a computer programmer, you’ll probably never come across a blockchain code. What you will see and interact with is what blockchain enables - namely, distributed applications, or “dapps.” The potential for these dapps is endless. One example is smart contracts. A smart contract is essentially an automated contract on a blockchain with terms agreed upon by both parties. Once the terms of the contract are carried out, an algorithm delivers the payment in cryptocurrency and documents the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts thus automate bureaucracy, eliminating the need for centralized authorities to verify the transaction. Many dapps already use smart contracts. On Ethereum, a public blockchain that supports smart contracts and uses a cryptocurrency called Ether, you can find dapps that use smart contracts to do things like record the origin of a work of art or time-stamp an idea you have for a film, creating an official document of your intellectual property. Other possibilities for smart contracts require only that we use our imagination. Currently, Uber uses a centralized app to connect drivers with customers and ensure payment. A blockchain dapp equivalent could use smart contracts to enable taxis to connect to customers directly, and bypass any centralized intermediary. Let’s take that one step further. Say that at some point in the near future you buy a self-driving car. Smart contracts could allow you to set the car up to run itself as a taxi 24/7.   If the car is low on gas, for instance, a smart contract between you and the car would be activated, and the car would drive itself to get its tank filled. Similarly, if the car has a flat tire, another smart contract would kick in and the car would drive itself to get the tire fixed. Eventually, your car will have earned enough money to purchase another self-driving car. The second car may then earn enough money to purchase another car all by itself. This process would continue until there was an entire fleet of autonomous taxis functioning without owners. Such a business model is called a DAO, or distributed autonomous organization. We can’t be sure right now whether such a model could be successfully realized. But the mere idea of it goes to show how blockchain offers radical potential. The hype around blockchain might sound familiar to anyone who remembers the utopian ideas surrounding the Internet in the 1990s. Although the Internet did make people more connected, it failed to bring about the egalitarian society that many had hoped for, as corporations like Facebook were quick to monopolize the network for their own growth. However, with blockchain, things may be different. That’s because distributed systems intrinsically shift accessibility and power to the masses. Think of investing. For most of history, it has been exclusive to the elite. Banking fees, credit histories, and limited access have undermined the ability of the lower classes to participate in this lucrative activity. But anyone can join a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meaning anyone can invest with them. Some even envision that cryptocurrencies will overtake the central banking system. That’s something that many people have dismissed, but since the US dollar no longer stands for a tangible asset such as gold, cryptocurrencies are really no less valid than dollars, or in fact any other currency. As more people start valuing cryptocurrencies, the vision of a future free of big banks might not be such a stretch after all. For the time being, the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and the Rockefeller Foundation are all already developing ways for blockchain technology to empower disadvantaged farmers, disenfranchised voters, and underprivileged people without banking access. Blockchain technology itself, of course, has no moral agenda. But the distributed system that it represents encourages a rethinking of hierarchies, creating a more equitable version of capitalism. In the same way that smart contracts could eliminate the need for Uber, blockchain dapps have the potential to enable other kinds of trading, like that around rented accommodation. Instead of paying fees to Airbnb as a central arbitrator, as the owner of a property you could set up a smart contract with a renter that would run the venture for you. Depending on your agreement, if guests overstayed their visit, the smart contract would either lock them out of the house or automatically charge them for a longer stay. This peer-to-peer system would mean a true sharing economy. In one episode of TV series Portlandia, the protagonists Peter and Nance interrogate their waiter about the life of the chicken they are considering ordering. Asking questions such as whether the chicken had any friends, the show pokes fun at the rising demand for transparency about where our products are coming from. In the future, you might be able to check your turkey’s journey from farm to table on your phone. Cargill, the company that owns the brand The Honeysuckle White, has already tested a blockchain dapp that lets people track exactly where their turkeys on Thanksgiving came from. This is not the only way in which blockchain is paving a way for a future of unprecedented transparency. Fura, Everledger and DeBeers are three companies devising blockchains to avert blood-diamond trafficking. With the technology, once the certification for a conflict-free diamond is entered onto the blockchain, it follows that diamond all the way up the supply chain, as its location is updated at each step. Not only would this mean that buyers could recognise and refuse blood diamonds at the point of purchase, it would also enable diamond miners to track where their stones end up, and even give them a chance to communicate with people at the top of the supply chain. In that system, the diamond miner would be just as important as the buyer at the top of the supply chain, and would have a real voice to influence how the system is run. At the same time as making transparency possible, blockchains also enable unparalleled privacy. Intimate is a dapp that enables pornography vendors and sex workers to offer their services using cryptocurrency and anonymous addresses. The dapp enables users to keep their identities private while making their reputation recognizable across the platform, making conditions for all participants safer. Up until this point, we’ve been discussing public blockchains. But some blockchains are private, invitation-only platforms. This kind of maximum privacy is essential for businesses, such as health care operators, that deal with confidential information, but it’s also being embraced by businesses in general. Computer behemoth IBM has already engaged private blockchains for major business operations using the Hyperledger Fabric framework, and other corporations are sure to follow. Still, the fact that corporations might opt out of transparency won’t affect blockchain’s utopian promise; the public chains will remain under the control of the public. As we’ve seen, blockchain has the potential to affect issues ranging from farming to investment opportunities. But here’s the catch: as of yet, blockchain networks require an extortionate amount of energy. This is especially true for the Bitcoin proof-of-work protocol. When Bitcoin was first released, you could mine coins from your desktop computer. Today, there is so much competition on the Bitcoin blockchain that it requires an assembly of computers drawing large amounts of energy. The business is so lucrative that professional bitcoin mining farms have been set up around the world. All this means that on some days the bitcoin network requires as much energy as the entire country of Denmark. That being said, for most blockchain applications, proof of work isn’t the most efficient way of authenticating new blocks for the blockchain. One example is the Ethereum blockchain. It has been experimenting with a “proof of stake” protocol, which does without mining entirely. Rather, nodes called validators place a stake or bet that they will be given the next block to validate. If they do catch the next block, they gain a financial reward. The hope is that such alternatives will reduce blockchain energy consumption levels as well as make transactions faster. Looking at the problem from another angle, there are many ways in which blockchain technology could become a tool in the quest for climate change solutions. One environmental application for blockchain is in the carbon-trading market. By turning carbon emissions into a tradable good, carbon-trading markets provide a financial incentive to offset air pollution. Beijing-based Energy Blockchain Lab, working with IBM, has already used the open-source Hyperledger blockchain to develop a new, more efficient platform for carbon asset trading in China. Another green use of blockchains could be the use of a reliable and transparent ledger to track greenhouse gas emissions. This would be essential to monitoring the progress made by nations pledged to the carbon reduction targets of the 2016 Paris Agreement. Blockchain could also be used to track endangered species, make the ultimate destination of donated funds more transparent, and certify land ownership to counter deforestation. The possibilities are endless. It’s up to us to embrace this new technology and continue to think of creative ways in which blockchain could make the world a better place. The key message in these blinks: Blockchain is so much more than Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Computer scientists are pushing this unhackable, distributed digital ledger technology to do everything from revolutionizing business to tackling climate change. While the actual uses of the technology will depend on the groups and individuals who use it, it intrinsically encourages an unprecedented degree of transparency, as well as challenging the inequalities inherent in traditional hierarchical systems.

    "title": "Born For This",
    "author": "Chris Guillebeau",
    "summary": "Everyone wants to win the job lottery. We all want to get paid for doing work we love so much that it doesn’t even feel like work. But you need to be exceptionally talented to make a living creating works of art or conducting cutting-edge experiments in a lab, right? Well, that’s not necessarily the case. A great job is waiting for everyone, including you – it’s the job you were born to do. You have all the right skills for it and it brings together your greatest interests. All you need to do is to find this job, but outdated career advice may be holding you back from doing so. That’s where these blinks come in. They’ll help you update your career roadmap and will tell you where to start searching.   In these blinks, you’ll also learn how to build a small business alongside your main job in just a few weeks; why you don’t need to settle for one of the jobs that are already out there; and what a 100 People Project is and how it can help your career. Some people have their entire life mapped out by the time they enter kindergarten. But for most of us, finding our life’s work takes a bit more effort, especially since career paths aren’t always straightforward and predictable. So, if you don’t know what you want to do with your life, don’t sweat it – just start experimenting. This is a good strategy because careers develop in unforeseeable ways and every job or project that grabs your attention could be a step toward your true calling. Say you follow your dream and join the circus. After a few months, you start to realize that you’re not so into cleaning up after elephants. So you transfer to the box office to sell tickets, but this new job, a bit too pleasant and a bit too clean, quickly gets boring. Done with the box office, you decide to get an office job outside the circus. Your new job is just starting to get on your nerves when you meet a client who owns a clothing line. Suddenly you realize that you were born to design circus-themed T-shirts! The point is, you don’t need to subscribe to a seemingly established career path. While some people are staunch believers in the notion that careers do follow strict scripts, these assumptions are invariably based on other people’s experiences. For instance, a common rule is that if a career opportunity comes your way, you should seize the chance because it might be your only one. In reality, abiding by such strict rules will undermine your creativity and obscure the path to your dream job. After all, just because something worked for someone else’s career doesn’t mean it will for yours. That’s why it’s important to flip the script, that is, to rewrite traditional career advice to match your needs. You might ditch the rule about jumping at your first career opportunity and write a new one that says, “If you don’t feel good about a job, pass it up.” There will always be other options. Imagine you had the chance to make one wish and you chose to win the job lottery, but it’s still up to you to specify exactly what you want. What does your ideal job entail? For starters, it should have the right mix of joy, money and flow. After all, the ideal job is one that pays you for doing work you love. If working with children is your greatest joy, second only to explaining things, then being a school teacher is perfect for you. But, of course, enjoying your work isn’t the only important factor; there’s also the issue of money. Even if you don’t want to be rich, it’s hard to enjoy your life if you’re constantly stressed about making ends meet. And finally, your ideal job should let you experience flow, a mental state in which you’re completely immersed in an activity, forget about time and do your absolute best work. All three of these ingredients are important for everyone, but the difference lies in how much of a priority each one is to any individual. So, joy, money and flow are central to determining your ideal career, but your working conditions are too. You might love the content of your work, but if your day-to-day conditions are poor you’ll just wind up stressed out and unhappy. To prevent this from happening, it’s important to determine the conditions that are right for you. For example, how important is it for you to set your own schedule? Could you be happy working a 9-to-5 job? Then consider what type of social environment suits your needs – do you want to work solo or on a team? Do you prefer working in a shared office or at home? Lastly, there’s reporting and accountability. In other words, do you prefer working autonomously or are you fine with being managed? How do you feel about your actions being monitored? Once you’ve answered all these questions, you’ll have a stronger sense of what kind of job is right for you. Now it’s just a matter of implementing a strategy that helps you attain it! Could fear be holding you back from following your dreams? If it is, you’ll benefit from boosting your confidence and taking more risks. To do so, start by listing everything that could go wrong and estimating how likely any given outcome is. You might find that many of your fears are either harmless or so improbable that there’s nothing to worry about, so you don’t have to be afraid to make your move! Next, make sure that a fear of missing out isn’t guiding your career decisions. After all, it’s a terrible basis for making decisions and will actually distract you from what matters. Say you have an interview at a company’s headquarters. Upon arriving, everyone looks tense and unhappy – but the interview goes great and they end up offering you a position. If you were desperate, you might feel compelled to accept, scared that it would be your only chance, even though the workplace environment looked downright scary. If you let your fear of missing out on this one opportunity guide your decision, it might end up making you miserable. And finally, prepare yourself for risks, make backup plans and build a safety net. How? Whenever you make a decision, consider the possible outcomes and determine what you’ll do if they come true. For example, say you want to send some bold advertising e-mails promoting your business. You can make an if-then sketch, which would go like this: If the first recipients take the bait, go out and celebrate! But if they don’t, then send a tame mailer with a printable coupon to the next prospects. Just make sure these backup plans are very specific to help you put them into place. Additionally, three general measures that make up your career insurance policy will help you control any damage if things go wrong – say, if you lose your job. First, maintain a network of supporters, that is, people who can help you build a career, find customers or get back on your feet. Second, secure an additional source of income to ensure that losing one won’t be the end of the world. And finally, always spend less than you earn to maintain a financial buffer. When hypothesizing about suitable careers, people tend to overfocus on things they’ve studied. For instance, a data scientist might only think of jobs that involve doing statistical computations. To widen your scope, make an inventory of all your skills and weaknesses. To do so, simply make two lists. One list should detail the things you do well – and that means everything, not just the skills related to your education. The second list should include everything you hate or struggle to do. This is crucial because your greatest weaknesses are unlikely to become your strongest skills. After completing these lists, you’ll get a first glimpse of the type of work you were made to do. The next step is to determine how you can make money by employing these skills to meet a demand and connect with prospective clients. And this might be simpler than you think. If the people you talk to every day are already telling you what area they need you to apply your abilities, you’re already on the right track. For example, you might find that coworkers always turn to you with relationship trouble or laptop malfunctions, which could point to an area where you can provide something that people are willing to pay for. Then, once you’ve identified this area, you’re ready to begin your 100 People Project, which works like this: Say you discover you’re great at giving weight loss advice. Your next move is to choose 100 people from your contacts list and social media, get in touch with them and offer them free 15-minute consultations. This will improve your skills while connecting you with potential clients for your future business. But remember, no matter what other talents you have, it’s essential to keep up your writing and speaking skills. After all, you’ll always need them to persuade others of yourself, your ideas and your products. Starting a new business is exciting, especially if it’s one that’s closely linked to your skills and passions. And the best part is, you can launch your dream business without quitting your day job. It’s possible to build a small business in your free time, as long as you do so systematically. In fact, loads of people who now earn their living from their passion initially built their business in their spare time as a side hustle. And just a single hour a day spent planning over the course of a few weeks is enough to launch a small business. But, naturally, you need to be careful not to waste your time. So don’t search out that one big business idea; it’s elusive and you don’t need it. Instead, answer specific questions: What kind of product or service are you going to provide? Who are your customers going to be? Which of their problems are you going to solve? What will your budget look like? How can you market your business? These questions are perfect because you can answer them in detail in your daily hour devoted to your new business. Then, once you’re done planning, you can start spending your daily hour executing your plans, one step at a time – for instance, by advertising your service on a social network. You’ll always be on the safe side if you follow this strategy. You’ll be able to rely on the income from your day job and won’t have to depend on your new business to succeed. As a result, you can experiment with your idea, learning a lot in the process while still paying your bills. And if your business does work out, it will give you a second source of income that will make you even more financially stable. That said, if you really want to quit your 9-to-5 and work on your business full time, you should do it – but only if your business is generating enough money to keep you afloat. Plenty of job-finding strategies seem like a good idea initially, but prove to be a colossal waste of time. And, truthfully, most of them are. So, if the well-worn paths don’t lead you to career success, just create your own job. After all, consider all the hours and energy you can invest in updating your LinkedIn profile or attending job fairs, only to come up empty-handed. These strategies simply aren’t very effective because thousands of smart, qualified applicants are also using the very same ones. This means lots of competitors, some of whom might be a better fit for any given position. So, a better idea is to invent the position that fits your skills perfectly and find a company that’s willing to create it. Some people even create their own titles. For instance, Tony Bacigalupo nominated himself to be the Mayor of New Work Cities, his coworking space. Just remember, this strategy is best used to search for a job within a company. But maybe you want to make a living from your creative practice. If so, just become your own manager and promoter. If you hide in your basement and paint all day, people won’t know who you are, regardless of how amazing your work is. That’s not to say you shouldn’t harness your inspiration to build a compelling body of work; but the art world has changed, and now you need to do much more than that. Writers, musicians and visual artists used to rely on a publisher, record label or patron to distribute their art, and would pay them a share for the service. But today, you can represent your own work. Start by reaching out to your fans and building an audience. Just do so through the best platform for socializing with people who appreciate your work; it might be through social media, by attending conferences or any other preferred method of putting yourself out there. And finally, it’s essential to figure out how to get paid. You might make money by selling paintings, through crowdfunding or even blog ads. Are you struggling with the question of what to do with your life? Well, if you are, it might be because you think you need to decide on a single, focused pursuit once and for all. In reality, you don’t need to pick a niche and stick with it for your whole life; instead, you can adapt your career to your changing needs and interests. After all, you never signed a contract saying you’ll do the same thing for the rest of your life. And that’s a good thing, because life is seasonal – your needs and interests will change as you do. If you’re raising a child, you might appreciate the regular schedule and steady income of a 9-to-5 job. But during other phases, you might prefer the nomadic lifestyle of a travel writer. A happy life is based on the ability to choose, but you also might want to focus on more than one skill over the course of your career. It’s not necessarily to the detriment of your career to pursue multiple interests. So how can you best transition between multiple jobs? One good way is to use workshifting, which is deliberately switching your complete attention back and forth between different projects. For instance, someone might focus on his landscaping business during the spring and summer while spending the winter months writing screenplays. Another person might work as a boxing trainer during the afternoons while offering relationship coaching in the evenings. And these combinations aren’t difficult to attain; these people have simply integrated change into their regular work schedule, allowing them to switch quickly and efficiently from one job to another. Just remember, there are lots of ways to live a fulfilling life, so find your passions and devote yourself to every one of them. The key message in this book: Finding the work you were made to do is never a straightforward journey. So, keep an open mind, use all the skills at your disposal and follow all your passions no matter where they might take you. Actionable advice: Do something different. The next time you make a New Year’s resolution, promise yourself that, at least once a year, you’ll break free from routine and do something different. It might be to take that yoga teacher training course you’ve always wanted to, or sell some special treat of yours at the park on a weekend. Regardless of whether it’s the beginning of a new business or not, chances are you’ll meet interesting new people, have new experiences and build your confidence – all while having lots of fun along the way.

    "title": "Buffett",
    "author": "Roger Lowenstein",
    "summary": "Besides Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett is probably one of the best-known billionaires in the world. With his low-key profile and homegrown style – he does his own taxes and wears slightly shabby suits – the “Sage of Omaha” is a beloved man, even among those who tend to have little sympathy for the super wealthy. So who is Warren Buffett? That’s what you’ll learn in these blinks. We follow Buffett from growing up in Omaha, through his early days in trading, to his years as the richest man in the world. And we get a glimpse of the unique investment sense he showed throughout his business life. In these blinks, you’ll find out that Buffett made his first stock trade as a child; what investment philosophy has influenced all of Buffett’s investments; and why Berkshire Hathaway is the company most associated with Buffett. Warren Edward Buffett was born to Howard and Leila Buffett on August 30, 1930, at a time when many families were facing an uncertain future. As a child of the Great Depression, young Warren learned the value of money. In 1932, when the Depression hit Warren’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, his father lost his job as a securities salesman for a local bank. But his dad was resourceful and soon began his own company, selling safe and reliable stocks and bonds. Earnings were meager. Indeed, they could afford so little food that Warren’s mother would often give her portion to Howard so that he would have a decent meal. These difficult times left a lasting impression on Warren Buffett, and fueled his desire for the kind of security and stability that money can buy. Even though his father’s business became successful when Warren was six, he never forgot those early Depression years. It wasn’t long before Warren’s interest in investment and entrepreneurship revealed itself. He always looked forward to visiting his father’s office, and, when Warren was ten, Howard took him on an exciting business trip to New York, where they visited the Stock Exchange. A year later, when he was eleven, Warren made his first profit by buying and selling stocks along with his sister, Doris. To afford these stocks, Warren had undertaken many entrepreneurial activities, such as roaming the local golf course to collect lost golf balls and then selling them back to the owner. At the age of 14, Warren was in charge of five separate paper routes, which had him getting up early every morning, delivering papers and collecting subscription fees. By saving every cent he made, Warren purchased 40 acres of land for $1,200. He wasn’t yet fifteen. Warren was no slouch at school, either. He graduated in the top three percent and enrolled at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, in Pennsylvania, where his love of money would only grow. With straight A’s as an undergrad, Buffett was surprised when his application for postgraduate studies was rejected by the Harvard Business School. But this rejection might have been for the best, since his professor at Columbia Business School (which accepted him) would have a massive impact on his life. That professor was economist Benjamin Graham, a pioneer in stock-market analysis with a unique approach to finding the right investments. The cornerstone of Graham’s philosophy was to avoid dealing with risky stocks altogether. He did this by determining a company’s intrinsic value and comparing it against the market value, which is the current price the stocks are being sold at. Finding a company’s intrinsic value requires diligent research. One has to add up all of its assets, including its revenue streams and future prospects. But it’s worth the work. When the intrinsic value is greater than the market value, you know you have a safe bet, and it’s only a matter of time before the price of that undervalued stock will rise to meet the market value. With this buying strategy, Graham became a legend for purchasing low-risk stocks and netting a high profit. Buffett loved Graham’s philosophy, which became the guiding force in his own practice. During and after Buffett’s time at Columbia, his relationship with Graham flourished. In Graham’s 22 years of teaching, he’d never had an A+ student. Buffett was his first. After earning his graduate degree, Buffett was eventually hired to work for Ben Graham’s Wall Street investment firm, Graham-Newman Corp. Some of his early proposals were turned down as they were considered too risky, but, in the end, Buffett became a star employee. One of his more memorable deals involved a chocolate company and realizing a way for everyone to benefit when the price of cocoa suddenly skyrocketed in 1954. A local New York chocolate maker was looking to Graham-Newman for help and Buffett saw that they could liquidate millions of pounds of cocoa and sell the beans to stockholders in their company. Based on the price of cocoa “futures,” this netted the company, and Buffett, a nice reward with every transaction. Buffet was never in love with the hustle and bustle of New York City. Furthermore, he was now a father, and he wanted to raise his kids in the peaceful environment of Omaha. Once he returned to his hometown, Buffett began forming his own investment partnership, Buffett Associates, Ltd. Within a year, he’d raised $500,000 from friends and family, all of which he put to work by flawlessly applying Graham’s theories and investing in undervalued companies that steadily paid off. In that first year, he was so successful that his initial $500,000 portfolio increased in value by 10 percent. By the end of the third year, that value had actually doubled! Remarkably, all the while, this youngster in Nebraska was outperforming the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. Finally, in 1961, Buffett took the next big step and purchased controlling interest in a company. It was the largest investment he’d made so far – a full million dollars of his partnership’s money, which he put into Dempster Mill Manufacturing, a struggling windmill company that most other investors wouldn’t go near. But Buffett knew it had solid intrinsic value, and his investment had made him chairman of the board for the company. He went to work sorting out their troubled finances. A year later, the company was on the path to profit, with $2 million worth of stock being traded at twice the price of what Buffett had initially paid. By 1963, that price was at three times its initial value and it was time for Buffett to move on, so he sold the company and earned his partners a $2.3 million profit. Incredibly, at just 35 years of age, Buffett’s 1965 portfolio had grown to be worth $22 million, and his own net worth was at nearly $4 million. In 1964, Buffett purchased controlling interest in Berkshire Hathaway, the company he is most closely associated with today. Berkshire Hathaway had started out as a textile manufacturer in 1839. But, in the early 1960s, American textile companies were losing a lot of business to the cheaper manufacturing markets in Asia and Latin America. So when Buffett began buying its stock in 1962, it was selling at only $7.60 per share. The company was in dire straits. However, when Buffett did his homework to add up its intrinsic value, he saw that the company should be trading at $16.50 per share. This made Berkshire Hathaway an amazing bargain that he couldn’t pass up, so he bought every stock he could get his hands on and, eventually, became the majority shareholder. Though it would always struggle as a textile company, it succeeded as a holding company for Buffett’s more successful companies – such as the insurance company National Indemnity Co., which he purchased in 1967 for $8.6 million. So even though textiles only earned Berkshire around $45,000 in profit per year, its holdings of National Indemnity stock earned it about $2.1 million. By 1969, Berkshire had become the main focus of his time and energy, and so he decided to dissolve the original Omaha partnership which, over the last 13 years, had increased exponentially in value – from half a million to $104 million. As chairman of the board at Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett continued to add new companies to its holding and, as a result, the price of Berkshire’s own shares went through the roof – increasing from $7.60 per share in 1962 to $95 per share in 1976! At this point Buffett was making quite a name for himself, and he was able to do something he always wanted to do – own a newspaper. In the 1970s, Berkshire became the largest outside shareholder of the Washington Post, the very newspaper Buffett had dropped on people’s doorsteps as a child. During this time, Buffett continued to pay himself his standard yearly salary of $50,000. In 1979, Buffett was still far outperforming the Dow-Jones Industrial Average; his own net worth was $140 million, and Berkshire was selling at $290 per share. As the country and the economy moved into the 1980s, Buffett’s investment philosophy began to move in a new direction, too. By the time the 1980s arrived, his longtime mentor Ben Graham had died and Buffett was no longer focusing on small, undervalued companies. He was buying big, recognizable businesses like the Washington Post and the insurance company GEICO. But though he’d outgrown Graham’s method, he still used it in principle. Rather than relying on a company’s financial assets to measure its intrinsic value, he now expanded his view to include its entire brand. His ability to make major investments, combined with the aggressive market of the 1980s, propelled Buffet to new levels of wealth. In 1980, the newly elected president Ronald Reagan made a pledge to turn the struggling economy around. To help with this, Reagan cut interest rates, which the influential economist Henry Kaufman predicted would only continue to decrease. This new environment sent people into a buying spree. With low interest rates, stocks become more attractive to buyers, and the Dow jumped 38.81 points, setting a new record high. Though none of this changed Buffett’s own patient and methodical investment philosophy, Berkshire Hathaway continued to reap the rewards. The Dow was going through the roof, and Berkshire’s stock rose right along with it. By the end of 1983, its shares were selling at $1,310 dollars. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings were now worth $1.3 billion. As for Buffett himself, over the course of four years in the 1980s, his net worth went from $140 million to $620 million. And in 1985, with the markets continuing to boom, Buffett finally made the Forbes magazine annual list of billionaires. Throughout his life, Buffett has comfortably stayed in the modest house that he purchased for $31,500 when he was 27 years old. But that’s just the beginning of the many ways Buffett defies the billionaire stereotype. To begin with, Buffett has never liked the idea of America having an elite class. Even in the early 1960s, when segregation was still widespread, Buffett defied many of his peers when he boycotted the local Rotary Club over its refusal to accept non-white members. This also led to his becoming a Democrat, even though his father had been a lifelong Republican who spent eight years as a congressman in Washington. But after his father’s death, Buffett began making frequent donations to Democratic political campaigns. And unlike many wealthy citizens, Buffett has spoken out against tax cuts for the rich – or, as he calls it, “welfare for the rich” – despite the fact that such tax cuts would benefit his own finances. Since his late 20s, Buffett has struggled to figure out what to do with his riches, since he doesn’t live a glamorous lifestyle with expensive cars, homes or clothing. Nor does he want his children to rely on his success. Instead, he has always taught them to forge their own paths in life and earn their own livings. So, in 2006, after his wife Susan passed away, he finally decided that he would donate most of it to charity. One sixth of his fortune has been divided among different Buffett family foundations, and the rest will be allocated over time to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which helps fight disease in developing nations. As of 2015, his net worth was $64 billion, which makes his commitment to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation one of history’s greatest charitable donations – a legacy he can surely be proud of. The key message in this book: With the help of his mentor, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett learned the important difference between how much a company is really worth and how much it’s selling for. An aptitude for discerning this difference, combined with a steadfast refusal to succumb to trends and a keen understanding of numbers, is what allowed Buffett to accrue a fortune exceeding $66 billion.

    "title": "Business Adventures",
    "author": "John Brooks",
    "summary": "After reading these blinks, you’ll understand why Bill Gates claimed that Business Adventures – which he received as a gift from Warren Buffett – was his favorite book of all time. After all, where else could he have found out what the launch of the world’s ugliest car, a wink from a General Electric company executive, and the fall of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain have in common? These and the other events described in this book represent several major developments in US business history, the repercussions of which can still be felt today. They paved the way for things like the end of insider trading and an employee’s right to work for whomever he or she pleases. In these twelve exciting and surprising case studies, you’ll find: how Wall Street almost killed off Piggly Wiggly, why shareholder meetings of large companies are usually a complete farce, and how a misinterpreted wink landed some GE executives in court. How much can a person miss in three days? Well, if you happened to be a stock market investor who fell into a three-day coma on May 28, 1962, you might have woken up to almost no noticeable change in your investments, but you also would’ve slept straight through the chaos of the 1962 Flash Crash. This three-day turmoil neatly illustrates how bizarre the behavior of Wall Street bankers can be, and how investors are guided more by their mood than actual facts. On May 28, 1962, the mood on Wall Street was distinctly glum after six months of stock market decline. There was a lot of trading going on that morning, and the central office was running late in updating stock prices, as this was done manually. Investors panicked when they realized they could only know a stock’s true price with a time lag of some 45 minutes, by which time they assumed the true price had fallen. Consequently, they rushed to sell off their shares, which created a downward spiral in prices. Their expectations became self-fulfilling, causing a crash that annihilated $20 billion in stock value. But just as emotions triggered the crash, they also helped move along the recovery: investors considered it common knowledge that the Dow Jones Index, which measured the value of the general stock market, could not go below 500 points. So when the value came close to that limit, a buying panic broke out as everyone expected prices to go up. Three days after the crash, the market had fully recovered. After this bizarre event, everyone was searching for rational explanations. But all stock exchange officials could come up with was that the government needed to pay more attention to the prevailing “business climate,” i.e., the mood and irrational expectations, of the financial market. This inherent irrationality translates into the market’s unpredictability. In fact, the only thing that can be predicted about the market is, to quote famous banker J.P. Morgan: “It will fluctuate.” Have you ever heard of the Ford Edsel? Originally intended to be Ford’s flagship product in the late 1950s, the car not only ended up being one of the most spectacular product failures of all time but is also frequently cited as one of the ugliest cars ever made. How could a company as successful as Ford fail so dismally? For one, it completely miscalculated the market. In 1955, the American automobile market was booming. Families’ disposable income was increasing and people were becoming more interested in medium-priced cars, a segment in which Ford was weak. That’s when the company started planning the Ford Edsel. Unfortunately, by the time the Edsel was launched in 1958, the market had done a 180: an economic downturn and an abrupt change in consumer tastes had made people flock to smaller and cheaper car models. A second reason for the failure was that customers had unrealistic expectations for the car. Ford had spent $250 million on planning the Edsel, making it the company’s most expensive project up to that point – a fact that Ford promoted extensively in its marketing. This created a lot of buzz around the project, so when the Edsel was finally launched, consumers were expecting something revolutionary. However, they were disappointed to see that the Edsel was just another four-wheeled automobile after all. The third and final strike for the Edsel was its shoddy build. Since Ford had spent most of its efforts on carrying out psychological research to make the car appealing to its target group (i.e., young families with a disposable income), it neglected to fine-tune the technical side of the car. Consequently, once the product launched, customers found several faults, ranging from unreliable brakes to a jumpy acceleration. Although the Edsel might not have been a completely useless car in the end, it just couldn’t live up to its expectations. Warren Buffett is one of the richest people on the planet, and yet he admits that his tax rate is lower than his secretary’s (whose income, naturally, amounts to far less than his). Sound like a cruel joke? Well, it’s the perfect example of how unfair the US federal income tax system is. To understand how it got so bad, let’s examine the increasingly twisted development of the system since its inception. In 1913, after decades of political debate and fears that it was tantamount to socialism, the federal government began to levy an income tax. The reason was that its own income stream had run dry while its expenses were increasing. Initially, income tax rates were low and the main contributors were the richest citizens. Since then, rates have been raised continually and the application of the tax expanded to larger swathes of the population and, at the same time, more and more loopholes were created for the rich. These days, the income tax rates are generally quite high and have the greatest effect on the middle-class population. The way the tax is structured today encourages inefficiency. For example, freelancers will often stop taking on new contracts mid-way through the year just to not earn more income because, from a tax perspective, it makes more sense than earning more. What’s more, the complicated system of loopholes has made enforcing taxation a battle. The Internal Revenue Service, which collects the tax, must annually contend with an army of citizens’ tax advisers and lawyers whose speciality is circumventing the tax code. This is a colossal waste of human resources on both sides. Unfortunately though, tax reform is politically unfeasible. Multiple presidents have tried to reform the tax code into something simpler, but all have failed. The current system simply favors too many rich people with too much influence, and they don’t want to relinquish their advantages, such as capital gains being taxed less than salary income. So what’s the solution? The federal income tax system needs to be reset back to its 1913 state so we can try again. Imagine your uncle works for an oil company and he calls you up one day to tell you to invest in his company’s stock, as they’ve just struck oil and will only announce it tomorrow. Sounds like, if you bought the stock, you could end up doing time for insider trading, right? That would hold true today, but it wouldn’t necessarily have been that way before the Texas Gulf case. In 1959, a mineral company called Texas Gulf Sulphur hit the jackpot in the wilderness of Ontario, Canada. Their preliminary test drilling indicated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of copper, silver and other minerals in the ground. The people who knew about the find decided to keep quiet about it, stealthily buying shares in Texas Gulf. And as executives and other people in the know began buying shares, they instructed their relatives to do the same. When rumors spread that the company may have discovered something substantial, Texas Gulf held a press conference to actively downplay the hearsay and spread disinformation – as its own executives continued to buy shares. When the company finally announced the news about its find, the price of the shares skyrocketed and everyone who had bought the company’s stock got very wealthy. While this behavior wasn’t considered ethical, even by Wall Street standards, insider trading laws hadn’t ever been properly enforced before. This time though, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action: it charged Texas Gulf with deception and insider trading. This unprecedentedly bold step angered many investors. At the trial, the court had to decide whether or not the results of the test drilling had made the value of the find clear, and whether the company’s subsequent pessimistic press releases were deliberately misleading. In the end, the court issued a guilty verdict along with a statement that the public needs to be afforded a “reasonable opportunity to react” to any news that will affect share prices before company insiders can start trading shares. From then on, insider trading has been regulated and Wall Street has become a little cleaner. In the early 1960s, the automatic copy machine was a huge hit and the product’s developer, Xerox, suddenly became the market leader. But, within just a few years, the company experienced a huge downfall. Let’s take a look at Xerox’s rollercoaster ride in three stages. First, there was initial success against all the odds. Traditionally, people weren’t interested in copying documents because they felt like they were stealing original content. What’s more, the process was expensive, since the first copy machines would only run on specially treated paper. So when Xerox launched its first plain-paper photocopier in 1959, nobody expected a high demand for the product. The company’s founders even went so far as to discourage their friends and family from investing in the company. Yet in just six years, the company’s revenues had skyrocketed to $500 million. Second, there was sustained period of success. Xerox became so confident that it started investing heavily in philanthropy. As is fairly typical for an overnight success, the owners wanted to show their gratitude to those who had helped them and use their newly acquired position to influence society. For example, Xerox became the second-largest donor to the University of Rochester, which had originally helped develop photocopying technology. What’s more, the owners seemed to care a great deal for the United Nations. In 1964, they spent $4 million on a television campaign supporting the UN after it came under public attack by right-wing politicians. In the third stage, Xerox was forced to see how quickly success can turn into defeat. Shortly after reaching the peak of its glory in 1965, Xerox realized it was in trouble. The technological lead it had over competitors had diminished as they were producing cheaper copycat products. What’s more, new investments into research and development were ineffective, which left the company stranded. These three stages are a poignant example of the many stages a growth company can potentially go through. Luckily for Xerox, it survived the third stage and is still successful today. In late 1963, the brokerage company Ira Haupt & Co. was in trouble. It no longer had sufficient capital to trade in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and its membership had to be revoked. The reason for this predicament was that the brokerage, which traded in commodities, had made a disastrous deal. It had bought cottonseed and soybean oil to be delivered at a later point in time and used the warehouse receipts as collateral to borrow money from the bank. Unfortunately, it turned out that the receipts had been doctored and the oil did not actually exist. Ira Haupt & Co. was suddenly the victim of large-scale commercial fraud and unable pay back the massive debt. After meeting with several banks, shareholders and the NYSE, it was found that Ira Haupt & Co. needed $22.5 million to become solvent again. To make matters worse, the entire nation was in a panic: President Kennedy had just been shot and the market was declining. But instead of letting Ira Haupt & Co. go bankrupt, the NYSE did something unprecedented: they saved the brokerage. The NYSE worried that the bankruptcy of Ira Haupt & Co. in a time of national panic would cause people to quickly lose faith in their investments and send Wall Street into a crash. They felt that the nation’s welfare depended on the survival of the brokerage, so they worked with the NYSE member firms and the brokerage’s creditors to hammer out a plan for Ira Haupt & Co. to pay back its debts. The NYSE itself pledged $7.5 million, almost a third of its total reserves. Together with other lenders it managed to save Ira Haupt. It is unlikely that we’ll ever see the NYSE make such a bold move ever again, but at the time it prevented a financial crisis in the heat of national panic. These days, whenever a company is mired in a scandal, they’ll claim that nobody did anything wrong – that the true culprit is “communication problems.” For example, if a company dumps toxic waste into an aquifer, it’s not out of greed, but because “The board failed to properly communicate the new environmental strategy to the local managers.” One case where this claim was put to the test was in the late 1950s when General Electric (GE) engaged in large-scale price fixing. No fewer than 29 electronics companies colluded to fix prices of $1.75 billion worth of machinery sold, with over a half a billion dollars coming from public institutions. The fixing could typically cost the customer as much as 25 percent more than normal price. When it turned out that GE was the ringleader of the price fixers, the scandalous matter was brought before the court and a senate subcommittee. Though some managers faced fines and prison terms, no higher level executives were charged. Why not? They claimed it was all due to a communication error: middle managers had misinterpreted their instructions. Apparently, at the time, there were two types of policies accepted at GE: official ones and implied ones. If executives gave you an order with a straight face, it was an official policy you should follow. But if they winked at you as they gave an order, the interpretation was up to you. Typically you were supposed to do the exact opposite of what was said, but other times you had to guess what the executive was implying. And if you failed to deduce what was implied, you’d be the one in trouble. Because of this, even though GE had a policy that forbade discussing prices with competitors, many managers assumed it was mere window dressing. But once they landed in court for the price fixing, they realized they couldn’t blame the executives. This story shows us that executives can, indeed, use communication problems to fend off responsibility for all manner of illegalities. Unless you live in the southern or midwestern United States, chances are you’ve never heard of Piggly Wiggly. Either way, in 1917, it patented the concept of the self-service supermarket. It was the first supermarket to, for example, provide shoppers with shopping carts, put price tags on all the items and have check-out stands. Piggly Wiggly still operates today, but is relatively unknown due to the actions of its eccentric owner Clarence Saunders, who went to great lengths to fight financial speculation. In the 1920s, Piggly Wiggly was rapidly expanding throughout the United States. But when a couple of franchises in New York failed in 1923, some investors tried to take advantage of this by starting a bear raid against Piggly Wiggly. A bear raid is a strategy where investors make investments that only turn a profit if a company’s stock price falls and then do everything in their power to force the price of the stock down. In Piggly Wiggly’s case, they claimed the whole company was in trouble due to the failed New York franchises. Saunders was furious and wanted to teach Wall Street a lesson: he started an attempt to corner Piggly Wiggly’s stock, meaning he wanted to buy back the majority of it. And he almost succeeded. He announced publicly that he would buy all existing stock in Piggly Wiggly and, after borrowing heavily, managed to buy back 98 percent of the shares. This drove up the stock price from $39 to $124 per share: a catastrophe for the bear raiders, who faced enormous losses when the price rose. However, the raiders managed to convince the stock exchange to grant them an extension on paying up. Saunders’ position was not tenable due to his debts, and he eventually suffered such large losses he was forced to declare bankruptcy. If only Saunders would’ve had more influence over the stock exchange, you might be wiggling yourself through the aisles of a Piggly Wiggly instead of shopping at a big box store like Wal-Mart. When a highly influential government bureaucrat jumps over to the business world and leverages his old government connections to make money, many people are likely to accuse him of being a sell-out. But in the case of David Lilienthal, this wouldn’t be an appropriate accusation. In the 1930s, Lilienthal was a good civil servant under the reformist President Roosevelt. Then, in 1941, he was appointed chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, an entity in charge of developing and distributing cheap hydroelectric power in areas that private providers didn’t cover. Later, in 1947, he served as the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, emphasizing the importance of the peaceful civilian use of nuclear power. And, when he finally left public office In 1950, he was honest about his motivation for the move, saying he wanted to make more money so he could provide for his family and save for his own retirement. Once he entered the private sector, Lilienthal also proved himself a committed businessman. His background in energy made him well-suited for the mineral industry and, since he wanted to experience the trials of entrepreneurship, he took over the severely ailing Minerals and Chemical Corporation of America. He succeeded in bringing the company back to life from the brink of failure and earned a small fortune as a result. His new line of work also influenced his own opinions: he wrote a controversial book about why big business is important for the economy and security of the United States. His old government colleagues accused him of being a sell-out, but Lilienthal was merely highly committed to both sides of the coin. Eventually, Lilienthal decided that he wanted the best of both worlds and, in 1955, founded the Development and Resources Corporation, a consultancy that helped developing countries carry out major public works programs. This latest endeavor proves that Lilienthal really is the ideal businessman: accountable in equal measure to both shareholders and humanity. Who do you think are the most powerful people in America? In theory, it should be the stockholders. Especially given the fact that they own the largest corporations in America and these giant companies wield such great power in American society that many political scientists have suggested that the United States resembles an oligarchic feudal system more than a democracy. These major corporations are always led by a board of directors elected by the shareholders, giving the shareholders the true power. Once a year, shareholders come together for an annual meeting in order to elect the board, vote on policies and question the executives who run the company. But, far from being the dignified, serious events you might imagine, these meetings are generally a complete farce. That’s because the company’s management doesn’t really feel that the shareholders are their bosses. They make it hard for shareholders to come to meetings by holding them far away from the company’s headquarters. At the meetings, they try to to keep the shareholders from getting involved by droning on about the company’s great performance and future. This tactic works with most shareholders. The only thing that makes these meetings interesting are the professional investors who challenge the company board and management into a debate. One comic example was seen in AT&T’s 1965 shareholders’ meeting, when investor Wilma Soss berated the chairman of the board Frederick Kappel and even suggested he see a psychiatrist. Professional investors like Soss often own stock in many companies and thus want to hold them accountable for their actions. In this case, Soss was fighting to get more women on the board of directors. But trying to rouse apathetic investors is a thankless job: there is nothing more passive and compliant than a small investor who is fed dividends regularly. If shareholders only wielded their power more often, company management could not simply do as they please. If one day you were to receive a highly tempting job offer from a competitor of your current employer, you’d be able to accept it, right? Actually, your right to do so was not always so clear, and you have a research scientist named Donald Wohlgemuth to thank for setting the precedent that allows you to do as you please. In 1962, Wohlgemuth managed the space suit engineering department of the aerospace company B.F. Goodrich Company. The market for space-related products was growing fast during the race for the moon, and Goodrich was the market leader in space suits. At the time, though, the company had just lost the contract for the now famous Apollo project to its main competitor International Latex. So when Wohlgemuth received an offer from International Latex to work on the prestigious Apollo project with more responsibility and a larger salary, he accepted without delay. But when Wohlgemuth told his superiors at B.F. Goodrich that he was leaving, they feared that he would divulge the secrets he had learned about space suit production. Due to this fear and the fact that Wohlgemuth had originally signed a confidentiality agreement, B.F. Goodrich then sued Wohlgemuth. When the controversial matter went to court, two key questions of near-philosophical nature arose: If someone hasn’t ever broken an agreement or shown the intention of doing so, can action be taken against them on the assumption that they will? Should someone be prohibited from pursuing a position that would tempt them to commit a crime? In a groundbreaking decision, the judge ruled that while Wohlgemuth clearly was in a position to harm Goodrich by sharing what he knew, he could not be found guilty of it preemptively, and so was free to enter into employment with International Latex. This decision formed the precedent for similar rulings, making it a great victory for employee rights. In the 1960s, of all the currencies of the world, the British pound sterling was perhaps one of the most prestigious due to its old age and high value. So when the pound came under attack from financial speculators in 1964, central bankers around the world felt obliged to defend it. The roots of the attack go back to the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, when the major economies of the world decided to build an international monetary exchange system where all currencies were exchangeable at fixed rates. This meant that, to maintain these fixed rates, governments had to often intervene in the currency exchange market by buying or selling currencies. In 1964, Britain found itself in economic difficulties: it was running a large trade deficit. Currency speculators believed that Britain could not keep up the fixed currency exchange rates and would be forced to devalue the pound. Consequently, they started betting against the pound in the market: they wanted its value to fall. Faced not only with the threat to the prestigious pound sterling but also to the international monetary exchange system itself, a broad alliance of monetary policy makers led by the US Federal Reserve mounted a defense. They started to buy pounds to counteract the pressure to devalue the currency. Initially, it seemed as if the tactic was working, and the first waves of attacks were fended off. But the speculators were persistent, continuing their attacks for years. Finally, in 1967, the alliance could not afford to buy more pounds, and Britain was forced to devalue the currency by over 14 percent. In hindsight, the war over the valuation of the pound sterling was merely the first sign of the inherent shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system, which would come to an end just four years later in 1971. The key message in this book: In many cases, how we understand the financial market and business ethics can be traced back to key incidents in history. One man’s fight to change employers, for example, made a lasting impact on employee rights.",

    "title": "Buying Your First Home",
    "author": "Ilona Bray, Alayna Schroeder, Marcia Stewart",
    "summary": "First job, first kiss and maybe even a first hangover; these are all memorable moments in a person’s life that might mark the start of another chapter when growing up. But there is one major step that really represents a person’s coming of age: buying your first home. This is a hugely significant choice that will stay with you for a long time – and perhaps even the rest of your life. So it’s no wonder that buying your first house is a highly stressful decision. These blinks invite you to forget the fear of taking the plunge, offering up plenty of insightful advice for you to find the right home at the right price. In these blinks, you’ll discover how to act in cold and hot markets respectively; what the lamps in a house can tell you, before you put in an offer; and how you should behave during the first visit to a home that you’re interested in purchasing. Just about everyone has thought, at one point or another, “I’d love to own a home.” But beyond the idea of having a house that is yours alone, investing in real estate is a one-of-a-kind opportunity: it’s a chance to control a large, valuable asset by paying a small lump sum up front as a down payment. For instance, it’s common to be able to buy your first apartment for about $100,000 just by putting $15,000 on the table and taking out a loan for the remainder. Not only that, but real estate is a relatively safe investment. While property prices drop during economic downturns, they don’t plummet irreversibly like stocks can. For example, according to the S&P/Case Shiller Home Price Index, in 2013, the average appreciation in value of American homes in the time since they were purchased was 12 percent. So, it makes good financial sense to buy a home – but it also has a psychological impact. After all, if you’re a lifelong renter, you know that having a temporary living situation can prevent you from investing in nice furniture or taking the time to decorate your place. So, you leave the walls white and that smelly carpet is there to stay. But when you move into your own place, everything changes – you suddenly feel an urge to personalize every detail. Another plus of home ownership is that having no landlord means you don’t have to wait for someone else to fix your leaky pipes. You also don’t have to fear rent hikes and the threat of eviction; all that stress just falls away. But even with all those upsides, people always find excuses to avoid home ownership, and it’s important to overcome them. For instance, you might think, “I have such a good deal at my place right now.” Sure, your rent might be cheap, but buying your own home means that it will, at least eventually, belong to you. In other words, your rent might be low, but would you rather it was cheap or free? Because free is what it’ll be when you’re the owner. You’ve probably heard that when it comes to real estate, the three essential rules are: “location, location and location!” The neighborhood you choose has an impact not only on your quality of life, but also your home’s resale value. So, the easy choice is an area that suits your personality, gives you a good sense of well-being and also makes your everyday life convenient. But it’s also important to pay attention to conformity. Buyers who are attracted to a particular neighborhood tend to have a certain type of house in mind and won’t pay attention to unique homes. For example, people who are looking to buy in small-house suburban areas won’t be interested in big houses in the same area because they can’t afford them. As a result, those houses will appreciate more slowly. Once you’ve decided on the neighborhood, you’ll be faced with another big question: are new houses necessarily better? The answer is sometimes, but not always. After all, if you’re into modern design and lifestyle, or simply can’t imagine a house without an induction cooktop and light shafts, you’ll want to go for a brand new house. But remember, “new” doesn’t necessarily mean “in perfect condition.” In fact, some developers simply do shoddy work, while others don’t finish on schedule, failing to compensate their buyers and even going bankrupt before the house is finished! On the other hand, old houses have their own problems. For starters, they tend to fetch a lower price at resale than brand new homes and often come burdened with replacement costs like those for water heaters and leaky roofs. In addition, old homes are generally less energy efficient than newer ones. So, you’ll also be left paying additional costs like modernizing your windows to avoid losing heat during the colder months. And finally, the layout of older houses is usually based on the tastes of a previous era. In other words, you might not like the size of the rooms or the lack of electrical outlets. If you’re like most people, you don’t have millions of dollars lying around just waiting to be invested in real estate. But don’t worry, there are other ways to pay for your first house. The most common, a mortgage, is a loan given for the express purpose of buying real estate. In such loans, the property acts as collateral for the money. So, if you take out a loan to finance your house and fail to make the mandatory payments to the lender, they can take possession of the house to recover their investment. While that sums up the basic idea, there are actually different types of mortgages. For instance, you might be offered a mortgage with a fixed or adjustable interest rate; the difference between the two is that the rate of the latter changes over time. However, most of the significant differences between mortgages are caused by the identity of the borrowers. For example, if you earn a decent, steady salary and can prove that you pay your bills on time, you’ll qualify for a lower interest rate. Similarly, you can also receive better loan conditions by putting forward a bigger down payment – doing so proves that you’re less likely to default on your mortgage. In fact, the down payment is crucial to your greater financing strategy. For instance, a few years ago, you could still finance 100 percent of a home purchase with a mortgage. But after the recent housing meltdown, many houses plummeted in value just after their mortgages were granted; the result was huge losses for lenders. As a consequence, lenders of today tend to feel safer financing just 80 percent of the purchase and require the borrower to come up with the remaining 20 percent. So, you’ve identified a few properties you’re interested in. What’s the next step? Visit them! But before you do that, remember that when you’re looking over a house to buy, you’re being evaluated as well. The seller’s agent will search for clues about your financial status. For instance, being too well dressed or wearing lots of expensive jewelry might signal that you can definitely afford the full asking price. That’s a good reason to ditch the suit and tie and dress casually – that is, if you intend to negotiate the price. Once you’ve taken a look at the place, and if it seems promising, it’s time to start asking questions. The first important thing to ask is how long the house has been on the market; this is a key indicator of its value. After all, while it depends on the market you’re in, if the property has been on offer for longer than a few weeks, it might be overpriced, which gives you leverage in negotiations. Another important question is to determine the cost of utilities like electricity, water and gas. This is especially important if they’re unusually high and your budget is already being stretched thin. Once you’ve gotten these questions answered, you’ll want to take a more careful look around. Specifically, you want to look out for any signs of past damage, which means looking for water issues, especially in the attic and basement. For instance, if you see moisture on the walls, you might be looking at a costly repair and a struggle to get insurance coverage. Additionally, you’ll want to check out the furnace and air conditioning as they might be old and obsolete, adding another expensive repair or replacement. And finally, ask about the neighbors. This one is crucial because neighbors can’t be fixed or replaced. Take a peek next door and get a sense of their noise level and general attitude. Hypothetically speaking, if the home you’re about to move into was once a drug lab, would you want to know? Well, while such information disclosures can be helpful, you should tend to approach them skeptically. In the United States, sellers are legally obligated to let you know about any important facts concerning a property, especially ones that may negatively affect its value. However, depending on where you live, such legal disclosures will be more or less detailed. For instance, California requires sellers to let a potential buyer know about everything from a leaky roof to any deaths that occurred on the property within the previous three years! But you can’t expect the same amount and quality of information in all states. As a result, these disclosures remain an incomplete and uneven source. For this reason, independent inspectors can and should be assigned to give a place a thorough run-down. Sellers sometimes conduct expert reports on houses, but you shouldn’t trust these blindly. Such reports might be months old and might not include new problems that you can discover. You should only trust professional inspectors that you personally commission. But before you hire your own inspector, it’s a good idea to try to spot big issues yourself. If you can identify major problems, you’ll be able to get the right expert to assess the severity of the situation. Say you find a house you want to buy. You should first check to see if the roof sags; if it does, you should hire an expert roofer to determine any potential foundation issues or whether the roof simply needs replacing. Similarly, if during your initial visit you turn the faucets to their maximum and notice rust-colored water or generally low pressure, a plumber could be called in to see how old the pipes are, how likely they are to leak and whether they need to be replaced. Real estate agents are experts at making total dumps look like lovely homes. You should always be on the lookout for the traps they set. In fact, to get the maximum return on a property, sellers and their advisors will gladly give a home a quick and superficial makeover. The most common industry trick is to empty the place out and rent furniture, artwork and flowers to dress it up before you visit. It may be shocking, but these simple additions, known as staging, can increase the selling value by tens of thousands of dollars. But don’t worry, it’s easy to spot this trick by looking for rooms that have less furniture than they actually need, or if there are few functional objects and lots of decorative ones. For instance, in a laundry room you should see detergents and cleaners, not just loads of flower vases. And pay special attention to lamps. Turn them all on to see if they actually work or if they were just placed decoratively – maybe even in corners with no electrical outlets. Another common situation to walk into is one where the owner never lived in the place, but just remodeled it to sell for a profit. This is called flipping houses and it might present a situation that seems financially attractive to you. For example, the owner might have laid a new floor or installed a brand new air conditioner, which means you’ll dodge those future expenses. But since the owner never lived in the place, he might not have had a huge incentive to do great work. As such, it’s hard to know for sure that the condition of the home is as perfect as promised. In situations like this, you’ll want to bring in a real estate inspector. His job is to appraise such situations and make sure that all the permits necessary for the remodel were properly issued. After all, you don’t want to discover after closing on a house that your swimming pool was installed illegally. Do you have reservations about hiring an inspector to assess a property you’re in love with? Well, you shouldn’t – inspections are par for the course. In fact, purchase contracts often include a clause that states the buyer can pull out of the deal if he’s displeased with the findings of an inspection. That’s why most buyers set up a general inspection to get an overview of a house’s condition. There’s also a secondary inspection often required by the mortgage lender: a pest inspection. That being said, this isn’t a legal obligation. For instance, in the United States, the buyer can decide the number, type and extent of the inspections they want to order. In fact, there isn’t really a “standard” inspection. That means the price of one can vary from $200 to $600 depending on the size, sale price, age and other characteristics of the property. So, to avoid an unpleasant surprise, it’s best to specify your expectations. For example, if you want the inspector to get under the house and look at the foundation, you should confirm it beforehand and be prepared to pay an additional fee. But it’s also important to check the professional qualifications of the inspector you hire. After all, you don’t want to bring someone in that isn’t licensed to do the job you’re hiring them for. And remember, you can’t rely on your inspector to check absolutely everything. What you can do is make sure he does a thorough job. Your average house is made up of 60,000 pieces, many of which are hidden by others. So, if the seller has copies of past inspections, it’s a good idea to use them as a guide. You can bring them to the inspector and can plan on spending time with him while he looks things over. If he takes an hour and claims to have checked the whole place, he might well have rushed and missed an important detail. It often takes at least a few hours to get a truly complete overview. Assuming you’ve found a place you like, that’s within your price range and for which you’ve been pre-approved for a mortgage, you’re ready to make an offer. Naturally, the trickiest part of this is deciding on how much. To decide on this magic number, you have to strike the right balance: if you offer less than the seller expects, you’ll face rejection; if you offer too much you’ll be overpaying. So, to find a happy medium, you need to consider whether the market is hot or cold. A hot market is one that’s lively and a cold market is one that’s stalling. In a hot market it’s common to see sellers set very low prices and let potential buyers bid each other up. For instance, the San Francisco Bay Area is generally considered a hot market because of the Silicon Valley tech boom. In this market, demand is so high that buying a house means making an offer that’s well beyond asking, just to beat out the competition. On the other hand, in a cold market you can often safely offer a price that’s below asking that the seller will accept, as they’re desperate to sell the property. But the market isn’t all you should consider; the seller’s personal position is also relevant when deciding on a price. So, it’s in your interest to learn as much about her current situation as possible. For example, if the seller just inherited the house, doesn’t live in it and just wants to get rid of it, you can expect her to take a lower price. Or, if the house is an investment for its owner and rents are falling, she might also be willing to part with it at a discount. The key message of this book: If real estate isn’t your strong suit, buying your first home can seem like a scary and insurmountable task. But, as long as you do your homework, it doesn’t have to be. By gathering as much information as you can about both the property and seller, you’re sure to get the home of your dreams for the right price. Actionable advice: Don’t rush into a deal. Say one day, when you’re writing out your rent check, you suddenly realize that you’re throwing money away and that it makes much more sense to invest in a home. That may well be true, but your realization shouldn’t make you run out and buy the first house you can find. Realistically, you want to allow yourself six months to a year to study the market, neighborhoods and purchasing process. Just remember, the average home buyer looks at 10 to 12 houses before making a decision. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Charlie Munger",
    "author": "Tren Griffin",
    "summary": "Here’s your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sit down and pick the brain of one of today’s most successful investors. These blinks offer a personal invitation to enter the talented mind of Charlie Munger, legendary investor and financial partner of Warren Buffett. As the vice-president of Berkshire Hathaway, Munger has done quite well as an investor – to put it mildly. These blinks give you the secrets to his success, outlining in clear detail the steps you too can take to hone your knowledge and become a smart, worldly and successful investor just like Munger. You’ll also learn why value investing is like waiting for the bus; why you should get to know the whims and worries of Mr. Market; and why “don’t just sit there, do something!“ is the wrong inspiration for an investor. Have you heard of Charlie Munger? He’s the legendary investor and financial partner of Warren Buffett, a household name when it comes to smart, successful investing. But that’s not all. Munger is also vice-president of Berkshire Hathaway, where Buffett is CEO. It should come as no surprise that Munger and Buffett have guided Berkshire Hathaway more than successfully! Berkshire Hathaway is the fifth-largest public company in the world. Its activities are broad, with interests in sectors such as insurance, finance, energy, utilities, rail freight transport, manufacturing and services. The company also is the sole owner of fast food restaurant chain Dairy Queen, clothing manufacturer Fruit of the Loom and private jet company NetJets, to name just a few. Berkshire Hathaway also holds considerable stakes in financial services firm American Express, technology giant IBM and The Coca-Cola Company. On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Berkshire Hathaway common stock is listed with the trading symbols BRK.A and BRK.B. In December 2014, a Berkshire Hathaway Class A share sold for over $220,000, the highest priced per-share trade on the NYSE. In 2015, the annual revenue of Berkshire Hathaway was $200 billion. Which begs the question: how did Berkshire Hathaway become such a success? The company’s success was built on the brilliant investing strategies and sharp minds of Munger and Buffett. For Munger, his success as an investor stems from his unwavering desire to teach himself new things. Indeed, he is the perfect example of his belief that successful investors must be learning machines. Munger and Buffett dedicate 80 percent of their working day to reading, making acquiring tons of knowledge a key part of their work. Munger says he wasn’t born a business genius but honed his investment savvy through countless hours of reading and absorbing information daily for years. Investors like Munger, Buffett, Irving Kahn and Seth Klarman all swear by one method: the Graham value investing system, invented by Benjamin Graham, an American economist and professional investor. What makes this system such a popular choice among the world’s best investors? This system is based on simplicity. The ultimate goal of the Graham value investing system is only doing things within your competence. As Buffett likes to say, investing is simple, but not easy. Rather than getting into complicated investments that you might not fully understand, accept the limits of your knowledge and focus on sure bets. Doing so will secure you far better results. In following the Graham system, Berkshire Hathaway sorts its potential investment opportunities into three baskets: In, Out and Too Tough. The In basket holds worthwhile potential investments and is the smallest basket. The Out basket contains uninteresting opportunities; the Too Tough basket holds opportunities that look great but are currently outside Berkshire’s competence. If you follow the Graham value investing system, you also focus on buying shares for less than their future earning potential. But in doing so, you need a healthy dose of patience waiting for them to appreciate. Seth Klarman likens investing to sitting at a bus stop and waiting for a bus even though you have no idea when it’ll show up. It’s your job as an investor to focus on long-term results to make the best of your investments. You have to be ready to wait until undervalued shares regain their value. You’ve also got to wait for the right moment to make a new investment. Unlike baseball, there are no strikes in investing. There’s no need to hit the ball with every pitch. Just make sure you’re ready to swing when the right ball comes along! In other words, great investing requires a realistic approach, not to mention patience and courage, too. Munger believes that just about anyone can follow Graham’s value investing system, as its guidelines are so simple and easily applied. Munger himself follows four important principles, easily adopted by any value investor. First, treat owning a share as ownership in a business. You won’t understand the value of your shares unless you truly know the company in which you are investing. Any valuation of a share must start with a valuation of the core business. Second, buy at a discount to give yourself a margin of safety. A margin of safety is the difference between the share’s current market price and its intrinsic value, that is, its future cash flow. Think of this as following cars on a highway. By maintaining a safe distance between your car and the car in front of you, you can predict or react to sudden movements more easily. Drive too close, and you could misinterpret a move and crash. The same goes for investing – rather than trying to predict future price jumps, prioritize your financial safety and buy at a bargain price. Third, always stay on the right side of the market. A Graham value investor knows how to spot mispriced assets and recognize the strange, even bipolar, behaviors of “Mr. Market,” the personification of the investing herd. Sometimes he’s depressed and sells assets at a bargain price, while other times he’s ecstatic and pays way more than he should. If you can spot them, investor mistakes such as these are golden opportunities for you. And fourth, stay rational. This is harder than it sounds. It’s your job to remain unemotional when selecting investment opportunities. Investing according to your mood is foolish and at worse, dangerous. To ensure your rational side is always in control, create a checklist that helps you divide tasks into simple blocks. This allows you to check in at every step and ensure that emotional errors aren’t lurking in your process. As Munger says, rationality is something you’ve got to foster. Putting in the effort to stay cool is worth it as you’ll avoid making senseless mistakes. It’s just not enough to have a great investment strategy; you also need to cultivate personality traits that will keep you on the path to success. To review, Munger believes patience and courage are essential traits for any great investor. The best investing opportunities come around when the market is fearful. This is important to know! The thing is, however, that predicting when the market will get jitters is impossible. All you can do is wait for a bargain to show its face, and spend the time while you wait gaining useful information about other investment opportunities. In other words, a “don’t just sit there, do something!” approach clashes with the philosophy of Graham value investing. Yet waiting can be challenging if you associate waiting with being unproductive! But moving around shares too frequently also means higher taxes, fees and expenses, so don’t let your itchy trading finger get the best of you! Be disciplined and stick to the waiting game. A Graham value investor must also be brave. Sometimes it’s hard to make a bold move when everyone else is holding their cards close to their chest. But remember, it’s market folly that creates the best investing opportunities for those who are courageous. Fight the tendency to follow the crowd and you may outperform the market. Indeed, this strategy is like playing poker. Not everyone can win a game; it’s just not possible. The same goes for investing – it’s mathematically impossible for every investor to outperform the market. You’ve got to keep an independent mind and know when to split from the pack. In this way, the worst times for other investors become the best times for Graham value investors. And finally, remember that nobody is perfect – not even Charlie Munger or Warren Buffett! We all make mistakes. But by cultivating discipline and courage, and pushing yourself to learn new things every day, you’ll always improve and your investments will thrive. The Graham value investing system isn’t the only framework Munger follows. He also channels the principles of worldly wisdom in every investing choice he makes. Worldly wisdom is a unique framework that makes use of a set of mental models, or ways of thinking, across a range of disciplines. Psychology, history, mathematics, physics, philosophy and biology – Munger believes that these all have wisdom that stems from each discipline’s unique way of seeing the world. By examining behavior through these different lenses, a savvy investor can spot similarities and patterns where other less-insightful investors won’t. So how do you cultivate interdisciplinary wisdom? Spend time learning about different fields, but not just by collecting loads of facts and information. Instead, focus on the core ideas of each discipline – why do people in each field study what they study? How do they structure knowledge? And how do they use it? These questions will help you find the wisdom in just about any social or natural science. Once you’ve done this, you’re ready to start relating these nuggets of wisdom to each other. This is what will help you make decisions as an investor. For instance, say the price of a product has recently increased, yet the company is still able to sell the product in increasing numbers. Doesn’t this event break the economic rule of supply and demand? Sure, but it also fits into a model one finds in psychology, that of a Giffen good – a product that a customer desires more when prices rise because it makes the good an exclusive or luxury item. Having worldly wisdom can bring a competitive advantage. Had a narrow-minded investor observed this price increase, he might have decided to abandon the assets tied to the product. A worldly, wise investor would recognize the product as a Giffen good, go against the crowd and stick to his investment. The key message in this book: Charlie Munger is a highly successful investor, but not because he’s tapped into some mysterious type of investing magic. By following his guidelines of continuous learning, simplicity, patience, courage and worldly wisdom, you too can boost your success in investing. Got feedback?

    "title": "Clients First",
    "author": "Joseph Callaway and JoAnn Callaway",
    "summary": "Just about everyone has heard the tired old phrase “the customer is always right.” But despite being such a widespread motto, it isn’t really true anymore. A far more appropriate philosophy for the modern world would be “the customer is always first.” But what does this mean in practice? These blinks, based on 122 simple instructions by a hugely successful real estate couple, show you why you need to focus – at all times – on the emotions, needs and desires of your clients. Instead of giving clients advice based on what you want, try basing your strategies and decisions on their wishes. It could very well give your business a new lease on life. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the authors increased their sales by advising clients not to buy from them; why customer loyalty can help carry you through a recession; and why being a success in business depends on maintaining your desire to learn. Whether you’re a high-flying consultant or a shopkeeper, you can be sure that good business comes from getting customers or clients to trust you. Of course, this is easier said than done. We all know why we should create stronger bonds with customers, but do we know how? In the end, it’s not so complicated. By focusing on the three areas of honesty, competence and caring, you’ll give your business the foundation it needs for a great customer-brand relationship. So, let’s get started with the first of them: honesty. Honesty isn’t just about telling your clients the truth, but telling the truth even when it might go against your interests. But a little white lie never hurt anybody, did it? Well, let’s dig a little deeper into why honesty is so necessary using the example of the real estate business. When it comes to real estate purchases, clients are making big financial and emotional decisions. They’re deciding where they and their family will live, and how much they’re willing to pay for it. It’s no wonder that clients often get overwhelmed. You might think that the best real estate agents would be those that prey on these moments of weakness, but the truth is quite the opposite. Agents who can keep their clients calm and composed with honest statements are the agents who will benefit from lasting, trusting relationships. In their real estate work, the authors met the Brown family. This family, though not very well off, were eager and determined to purchase the house being sold by the Smith family. The authors could have closed the deal with the Browns in a heartbeat; but knowing that the mortgage would cripple them financially, the authors told the families the truth and advised against the sale. The result? Both the Smiths and the Browns became loyal clients, seeing that the authors really did have the customers’ interests at heart. And they made sure to recommend the authors to all their friends, too! Honesty is the best policy, but it’s not the only approach you should implement when dealing with customers. The second essential aspect of putting customers first is competence. Competence simply means showing the customer that you’re an expert at what you do. But competence isn’t about working until you’re the best and stopping. In order to demonstrate competence, you have to embrace a process of continuous learning and development. To become a great real estate agent, you have to be ready to learn non-stop. Since they were starting out as amateurs, the authors’ first real estate jobs were complete disasters. This could easily have pushed them toward a completely different career path, but they were determined not to give up. The authors began attending conferences and seminars, often up to ten times a year. They subscribed to trade magazines and even used their commuting time to listen to educational CDs; it was this perseverance that gave them the competence to win over an army of loyal clients. Now it was time to ensure that their whole team demonstrated the same sort of competence, too. The authors put time and effort into assembling a top-notch customer service team, where members knew their roles inside out. This way, their clients would witness competence in action at every step of the process. But what does this look like? Well, when a client comes in, they first talk to Martin. He arranges a time for Ed to visit their house and measure it. Next, Judy will stage their house and Aaron will photograph it. Donna oversees and open house and eventually when the house receives an offer, she contacts Joseph and JoAnn, the authors, to close the deal. What do salespeople think about when trying to close a deal? Their commission, surely! Well, not if they’re good salespeople. Putting the client first means, above all else, caring for the client – and not just the commission! Caring for clients doesn’t refer to maternal feelings or offering a shoulder to cry on. Though we usually define caring in terms of sympathy or empathy, caring in this case is more about understanding where the client’s interests lie. When clients see that companies really are looking out for their interests, they’ll be more than ready to listen to the advice they receive. A caring company might even fight to change a client’s mind if they think the client is heading down the wrong path. Think of the Brown family from the previous blink. In such cases, it’s crucial that the client knows the company puts them first; only then will clients reward companies with their trust. In other cases, companies struggle to get to the bottom of what a client wants, because the client has irrational or embarrassing fears they wish to hide. But once they share a trusting relationship with the company, they’ll feel comfortable enough to tell all. And when things really go well, care goes both ways. Clients will care that the company performs well, and will take pride in spreading the news about them to their friends and family. Word-of-mouth advertising is incredibly powerful, and you never know when it could make a big difference for your company. During the market crash of 2007-2008, the author’s competitors in real estate experienced a drop in commissions of up to 70 percent. But the authors’ commissions only fell around 20 percent. Why? Their loyal customer base showed that they cared about the company too, and continued to support and promote them despite tough times in the market. The economy operates in cycles – there are good times and bad times. But this doesn’t make the bad times any easier for companies. Slumps in the market can threaten to put many once-thriving enterprises out of business. But there is one way to give your company the safety net it needs: building a strong customer base. During the 2007-8 financial crisis, the real estate market in the United States collapsed. Buyers became reluctant to take out mortgages to buy homes, while sellers flooded the market and banks tried desperately to get repossessed homes off their books. In other words, the price of houses had plummeted, but nobody was buying. Real estate businesses across the United States were struggling to stay afloat. The authors, however, managed to keep their real estate business relatively stable. The reason? They consistently put their clients first. Their honesty and care for the clients and their interests allowed them to maintain strong, trusting relationships despite a collapsing market. In addition, their competence helped the authors stay on top of changing legislation, ensuring their clients received the best advice possible. It wasn’t just a trusting relationship between client and company that helped keep the authors afloat during the financial crisis; a strong team relationship also carried them through. During the crisis, many businesses chose to lay off their staff and shrink their companies. But the authors weren’t prepared to start firing employees, as it would cause their overall competence to drop. The team showed their appreciation for this by working harder, which kept customer service at a consistently high level during the crisis. Knowing how to put your clients first is one thing – enjoying putting them first is another! In order to truly build successful customer relationships, you need the right attitude. After all, there are few things more important than finding joy in your job. The truth is that with the right mindset, any job you do can make you feel fulfilled and, yes, happy! Rather than trying to do what you love, why not start trying to just love what you do, whatever it may be. This is itself a very useful skill, particularly when we end up doing certain jobs as a last resort. When their children were in elementary school, the authors urgently needed work, so Joseph found a job as a housekeeper at a local hospital. While other housekeepers didn’t like their job, he took another approach and took the time to do the best possible work. His manager told him that in 32 years, she had never seen an employee do such a good job. Such praise made this supposedly undesirable line of work feel worthwhile. Ultimately, businesses revolve around people and their needs – and talking to and liking your clients is the only way to discover such needs. When he was new to the real estate game, Joseph used to go around his neighborhood knocking on doors, sometimes dropping by 30 to 40 neighbors each day. As he knew little about real estate, he avoided the topic and instead asked questions about the neighbors themselves. At first, it didn’t lead to any business, but it taught him to like and care for the people around him. In the end, his caring approach paid off: within 12 years, Joseph had sold one-third of the homes he had visited. The key message in this book: Because clients are people like anyone else, success when working with clients is fundamentally based on putting their interest first. By demonstrating honesty, competence and caring, you can set your company apart from the competition, while creating support networks that will keep you afloat even in times of crisis. Actionable advice: Honesty is the best policy! Be honest and caring with people, and you will never have to worry about what you said or did in the past, or how it will affect you in the future. At the same time, honesty will create trust in your relationships with clients and make you a sought-after professional. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings",
    "author": "Philip A. Fischer",
    "summary": "While the stock market goes up and down from year to year, it’s good to know that some of the fundamentals of investment theory have remained consistent for generations. Although Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits was published in 1956, the advice it offers on investing is just as relevant as it was when Eisenhower was U.S. president. These blinks lay out the key characteristics of what you should look for when investing in a company, and helps you determine whether you’re a high-risk investor or a conservative one. Just like a detective, a successful investor does her homework and digs deep to get all the pertinent information before putting her money on the table! After reading these blinks, you’ll know how to determine if a company stock is overvalued; why stock price doesn’t tell you whether a company is actually any good; and how to conquer doubt and not hesitate when it’s time to buy. The common perception of investing is that it is fast-paced and brutal, with investors buying and selling seemingly on a whim, seeking quick profits above all. Yet smart investing involves much more thought and planning, and is ideally focused on the long term. Smart investors don’t seek quick profits but instead looks for companies with growth potential that over time will multiply an initial investment. It isn’t easy to identify which companies offer this kind of growth potential. Indeed, many stocks are either over- or undervalued, which can make investing difficult. Smart investors look for companies with potential that are nonetheless still undervalued, as such companies can, when the time is right, grow with such rapidity that an investor can double or even triple his initial investment. Luckily, companies with growth potential can be recognized by their common characteristics. Such companies offer products and services that ideally could sustain high sales volumes for at least a few years. Companies with good growth potential also invest in research and development, to continue growing even when a current product line no longer offers opportunities for growth. The 1950s, for example, was a great time for television manufacturers. But by the middle of the decade, nearly everyone who wanted a black-and-white TV already had one. This meant that, until the color television was developed, TVs companies faced flat growth; so they had to adapt. Motorola, now known for mobile phones, used to produce televisions and radios. But management had the foresight to harness the company’s technical skills and experience to enter the two-way communication business, and continued to grow sales while other TV manufacturers’ sales flatlined. Companies with high growth potential also have a solid management team and good employee relations. Don’t invest in a company whose employees are too busy squabbling to be productive, and whose executives can’t inspire solidarity or a shared vision in the workforce. Successful investing is a lot like the work of a detective, as you need to research your topics thoroughly and analyze all available data to be effective. When considering a company’s investment potential, you’ll want to collect detailed information about the company from every possible angle. Of course, you could easily track down a trader and ask her which companies she would recommend investing in. However, there is no guarantee that she’ll give you accurate information, because traders have to protect their own interests. Instead, employ the scuttlebutt method: dig for information from every possible source. Contact vendors, customers, former employees and research scientists or executives in trade associations. You’ll be amazed at what you find, as long as you ensure that you won’t make the information public or out your informant. Contacting a few of the company’s competitors could also yield surprisingly accurate and detailed information. Once you’ve developed a profile of the company, it’s time to contact company management directly to ask them informed questions. The scuttlebutt method is accurate, yet time-consuming. To avoid wasting any time, choose the companies you wish to research very carefully. This will require you to pre-select companies that could offer the kind of growth potential you want for your investment. Start by simply talking to friends or other investors, looking at printed materials and asking yourself which companies seem promising. If you read in the newspaper, for example, that a company’s manager is resigning because of some questionable dealings, then you won’t want to waste your time on that company! Once you’ve identified a company with good long-term growth potential, is it time to buy? As mentioned earlier, stocks are often over- or undervalued, so how can you ensure that you get the most bang for your buck? Stock prices mirror the financial community’s perception of a stock’s value at the current moment, and these ratings create a vicious cycle. If the community values a stock too high, for example, then people rush to buy, based on its perceived value. The stock price then continues to climb, resulting in a price “bubble.” People don’t buy and sell with an eye toward the future. For instance, if a successful company encounters an unexpected expense, even something as benign as a research project, this can cause the investment community to downgrade future projections for the company. As a result, the company’s stock price will fall, even if the research project would drive profitability down the road. This simple realization about the stock market’s irrationality can help you earn extraordinary profits! Companies with potential to grow are often innovators, and they’ll inevitably run into bumps along the road. Consequently, the financial community will undervalue the stocks of these companies. To illustrate this, image you’ve found a widget manufacturing company with huge growth potential. At first, the hype surrounding the company causes the stock price to rise. However, a problem soon appears: the casting mold for the company’s widgets were improperly sized. Now everyone thinks the product is a flop; and the stock price falls. This presents the perfect time for you to buy in cheaply, to profit when the company ultimately fixes its problems. If you miss an opportunity like this, don’t worry, as there may be another chance to get in during the next dip. For example, the company’s stock rises after it fixes its casting mold problems, yet it announces that its sales staff has racked up unexpected costs in rolling out the product. Exasperated, the financial community bails out, thinking the company will never make it. Yet for you, it’s an opportunity to get the stock cheaply again! Doubt is natural. Inevitably, once you’ve identified a stock that you want to buy, you’ll feel the pangs of doubt that cause you to hesitate. A successful investor however has no room for doubt. Don’t hesitate once you’ve identified a company with profit potential. Often this hesitation derives from the whims of the crowd. If no one else is jumping on a stock, couldn’t that mean that it isn’t really that valuable? Yet you’ve already seen how the financial community is so often wrong about a stock’s value. Surely, it’s scary to buy when everyone else is selling! But if you truly believe a company has potential, then take a deep breath, and buy. Besides, you really don’t want to be buying what everyone else is buying. At that point, the stock will be too expensive to be a truly great investment. And if you hesitate, you may never get the same opportunity again. Resist the urge to let a stock’s price fall further to get a better deal. By doing so, you might miss a golden opportunity. That’s exactly what happened to one of the author’s acquaintances who wanted to buy 100 shares of a stock listed at 35 1/2. In an effort to save himself 50 cents, he offered only $35 per share. The share price, however, continued to rise! Had he made that extra 50-cent investment that day, he would have earned a total of $46,500 some 20 years later! Finally, once you’ve found a good investment, you should hold on to it. From a business perspective, there are only three valid reasons to sell a stock. One, you misjudged the company’s growth potential. Two, your judgment was sound, but the company conditions changed. And three, you’ve invested in a middling stock in the near-term to keep you busy while you search for an amazing investment. Any other reasons, such as making money quickly or following the crowd, can only harm you. A company with huge growth potential can never be overvalued! So far we’ve examined how to win big with high-growth company investments. Yet for some investors, a more moderate profit strategy with gradual but consistent growth is more attractive.   As a conservative investor, you want a strong company that still has the potential to grow. If you’re trying to play it safe, you shouldn’t invest in start-ups, no matter how promising they appear. Rather, keep your eye out for large, established companies that have a proven track record of profitability. For this strategy to work, however, the company still needs to have growth potential to maintain its market position. This doesn’t need to be stratospheric potential, of course. Rather, the company must simply be able to grow and develop. Otherwise it will eventually be outpaced by more agile competitors. A company that is both strong and able to grow demonstrates these four major characteristics. First, the company’s production methods are low cost, such that it can continue earning profits even when prices rise, through inflationary periods or market crashes. Second, the company is well organized and effective in its market, meaning it can actually deliver its products and services. Third, the company has an outstanding track record in research and technical development, allowing it to continue innovating and improve upon its products and services. Finally, the company needs to demonstrate financial know-how. It must be capable of allocating resources only to initiatives with profit potential, and have a good eye for warning signs that indicate it’s time to move on. If you are a conservative investor, it’s also important to examine a company’s employee base and learn more about how the company treats them. There are two main reasons for this strategy. First, a company’s growth potential is entirely dependent upon employees who put into motion the company’s strategy. Indeed, all of a company’s advantages are the direct result of work performed by its employees. To foster innovative technical development, for example, a company needs devoted, ambitious research and development teams. To ensure production methods are low cost, a company needs a bright manager who is always on the lookout for gains in efficiency. Second, how a company treats its staff can help you figure out just how productive and effective that company is overall. People don’t deliver the best results when they’re mistreated; yet companies succeed when employees are valued. By looking at a company’s human resource and management policies, you can get a better idea of how a company is run and better judge its long-term potential. Look, for example, at the way the company handles promotions. If they rarely promote from within and instead prefer to hire from outside the company, then this is a strong indication that the company isn’t grooming employees or developing potential through training. This is a red flag that the company does not handle its human resources wisely, and is therefore not the kind of company in which you would want to invest. The same applies to management’s ability to work together as a team. If a company manager seems to think he’s running a one-man show, how can he be expected to manage efficiently as the company grows? Look instead for a company that forms well-organized teams, and for managers who can effectively delegate responsibility. When evaluating a company, a conservative investor should look into the future. Not only must the company be strong today, but also it must have the means to protect its position over time. When making this evaluation, an investor should view a company’s profitability not as the sum of its returns, but rather in terms of the size of its profit margins. The bigger the better! You want to find a company that will be profitable in the long term, one that will continue growing even during challenging economic times. The reason that profitability is so important is because growth always requires monetary investment, be it for research and development, new inventory or marketing. Thus the company must ensure its future profitability to finance additional expenses to come. Profitability also gives the company a buffer when it falls on hard times; when costs rise, the company must have cash on hand to stay in business. But how can a business ensure long-term profits? In short, by being better than the competition! A company’s long-term profitability hinges upon its ability to do or create something that competitors can’t, lest the competition steal its market share. One way to ensure market dominance is through scale. In other words, a large producer can produce more than a small competitor can, and at a lower cost.   For example, a big company that produces a million pencils per month will have lower production costs per pencil than a company that can only produce 100,000 pencils monthly. Another way to ensure a company’s market position is by creating technical developments that can’t legally be copied by other companies, due to patent or copyright. You want to be sure that a company’s strategy takes into account and is prepared for the long-term development of the business. A company can be incorrectly valued based on the whims of the investment crowd. As you’ll see, a stock’s value is even more subjective than that. In fact, its value changes from person to person. Indeed, a company can be worth more for a risky investor than for a conservative one. A risky investor might value a stock higher if a company is expected to grow rapidly, but this fact doesn’t help the conservative investor. A conservative investor shouldn’t pay in terms of expectation. Instead, a conservative investor pays the real price of a stock. Essentially, the conservative investor is looking for stable, growing companies that are either currently undervalued or priced at their real value. One way to determine this is by using the price-earnings ratio. To do so, simply take a company’s stock price and divide it by the company’s earnings per share. For example, if a company is earning $1 per share, and sells its shares at $10, then its price-earnings ratio is 10/1, or ten. At its last annual report, however, if the company says it earned $1.82 per share, this brings the ratio down to 10/1.82, or five. However, higher earnings represent positive projections, which could cause a huge spike in the stock price. Imagine that the company stock now sells for $40. The ratio would be 40/1.82, or 22, far higher than it was previously. It’s up to the conservative investor to decide whether the company’s characteristics justify the market’s belief that the company will continue growing beyond its current $40 share value. While someone looking for huge short-term gains might not be bothered by a $40 share price, a conservative investor might find the price a bit too steep, considering what she knows about company management! The key message in this book: To be a successful investor, you have to be willing to dig. A company’s true value is based on so much more than its stock price alone! If you’re willing to put in the detective work, you stand to reap great rewards no matter whether you’re a conservative investor or a high-risk one. Actionable advice: Go to your bank as an information source. If you’re having trouble finding information on a company, try contacting your bank. As long as you are open about your intentions, they can easily make an introduction for you. Be clear that you are looking for information for yourself and will treat the information with the utmost discretion.

    "author": "Brian Murray",
    "summary": "To many, real estate appears to be the perfect investment. Even when the financial sector is in turmoil, property prices always seem sure to bounce back, allowing real-estate owners to relax while other investors panic and lose their life savings. So why doesn’t everyone simply invest in property? Well, as with most things, investing in real estate isn’t as simple as it seems. There are many pitfalls, and it’s as common for a property to represent a financial drain as it is for it to lead to financial gain. This doesn’t mean that real estate can’t make you wealthy. It most certainly can. However, there are many important things to consider, both before and after you make your first investment – and that’s where these blinks come in. They’ll provide you with a wealth of real-estate wisdom from a property-owning pro who learned all his lessons in the field. You’ll also find out why you should put your office in the basement; why property owners aren’t passive; and how to make your property feel like home. You’ve probably had the thought. If only you could buy a piece of valuable property, your money problems would be solved forever. And yes, investing in commercial real estate can lead to considerable wealth – but there’s a bit more to it than buying a few apartments and awaiting the inevitable blizzard of banknotes. First and foremost, you’ve got to get a handle on a few financial concepts, the most important of which are net operating income and cash-on-cash returns. A property’s net operating income is easy to calculate. Simply take the income the property will generate for you in a year – things like the rent you’ll receive from tenants, the money generated by the laundry facilities and the fees levied on pets. Take this number and subtract the property’s yearly costs – for example, property taxes and maintenance expenses. The difference between these two numbers is the net operating income. Now that you’ve got this number, it’s time to calculate the property’s cash-on-cash returns. To do this, take the net operating income and divide it by the amount you’ve invested in the property upfront. Now multiply this number by one hundred and put a percentage sign after it. That percentage is the property’s cash-on-cash returns, and the higher it is, the better. If you want to expand your portfolio, you’ll need to focus on investments that carry little risk. And the properties that provide an instant cash flow are usually the least risky. This is why knowing these numbers is of the utmost importance. By investing in properties with large cash-on-cash returns, you’ll increase your cash flow, thus reducing the risk inherent to all investments. In the real-estate game, cash is your lifeboat. Mistakes will be made, and unforeseeable events are as inevitable as high waves on the open sea. It behooves you to have a means of staying afloat. Once, an eager young investor shared her plans with the author, Murray. She confided that, after buying her first piece of commercial real estate, she planned to say goodbye to her current job and splurge on some luxuries. She looked forward to an array of purchases: a new car, new office space and a set of elegant business cards. The author could only look askance at these plans, however, because he knew something that she didn’t: investors entering the real-estate market should do everything in their power to avoid spending money. If you’re an aspiring real-estate investor, then bootstrapping – that is, making creative use of the resources at your disposal – is your best bet. Stretch your funds as far as they will go, and put all extra cash toward new real-estate deals, not toward flashy office space and showy business cards. A bit of self-sacrifice is the name of the game. When the author purchased his first office building, for example, he selected a tiny utility closet in the basement as his personal office space. He could have taken the fanciest space available, but that wouldn’t have maximized his income. By choosing the least desirable spot, he profited from the building’s every square foot. The young investor was equally misguided in her plan to quit her job. The author, like most other successful investors, held onto his job until his real-estate business was firmly established. Indeed, for the first seven years of his real-estate career, he simultaneously worked as a teacher. He did this because, in his business’s early days, subtracting a personal salary from his earnings would have imperiled the entire enterprise. And this holds true for all young real-estate businesses. At first, you’ll probably struggle to keep the business afloat, let alone make a substantial profit from it. The author didn’t take any risks. Only when his business was bringing in $2 million every year did he finally quit his day job. There’s a myth surrounding real-estate investment. It goes something like this: once you buy a property, all you have to do is sit back, relax and watch the money pour in. This myth took shape over hundreds of years. For centuries, the nobility and landed gentry passed land from generation to generation, pocketing the money from tenants and employing people to manage their properties for them. More recently, scamsters promoting get-rich-quick schemes have perpetuated the myth that property is an investment that will generate a passive income. But here’s the thing: if you want to maximize revenue from your investment, you can’t afford to be passive. Property shouldn’t be treated as a mere asset; it should be handled like a business and managed accordingly.   So don’t make the mistake of employing an army of middlemen to handle things for you. Asset managers, portfolio managers and property managers all represent financial outlay, as does every contractor you employ. Hiring others to run your investment will only erode your income. You can avoid this revenue-devouring pitfall by managing everything yourself. Review and write leases yourself. Broker deals yourself. And personally take care of manual labor, such as snow removal and landscaping work. Cutting out the middlemen won’t only increase your revenue by decreasing your expenditure; it’ll also ensure that you are in charge of your own fate. In other words, you’ll both have more money, which you can then reinvest in your property, and you’ll have more control over your investment. Since how you handle your first commercial properties will play a pivotal role in your future success, self-management is truly in your best interest. As long as you’re determined to succeed and unwilling to compromise, you’ll be capable of feats that no property-management company could guarantee. After all, no management company, no matter how good, will ever have as much at stake as you do. Tenants are the bedrock of your real-estate business. After all, without the rent they provide, your investment would essentially be worthless. This raises two important questions: How much rent should you charge and how should you select your tenants? Well, first of all, don’t try to squeeze as much money as possible out of your tenants. It’s smarter to charge slightly below the market rate than to demand the highest rent you can.   Here’s why: overcharging often ushers in an array of undesirable consequences. For example, if potential tenants can’t afford the rent, they simply won’t rent from you – and if your building is standing vacant, you won’t be earning anything. Even if some people do choose to pay the high rent, they’ll be more likely to seek a cheaper space when their lease runs out, leaving you back where you started. Setting rent just below the market rate, however, will have the opposite effect. Your tenants will be eager to renew their leases, and their continued tenancy will reduce your marketing and turnover expenses. Furthermore, if you keep the overhead of your commercial tenants relatively low, their businesses will be likelier to flourish – which is good for you, because the more successful they are, the less likely they are to leave. Now that you’ve got a sense of how much (or should we say how little?) to charge, you should put some thought toward two more things: who you want to rent to and how compatible your new tenants are with your current ones. For instance, let’s say the majority of the people renting from you are senior citizens. They appreciate the peace and quiet of your property. Well, if an apartment opens up, you definitely shouldn’t rent it to a group of rowdy college students. Along those same lines, if one of your commercial tenants is running a toy shop, it’d certainly be unwise to rent the adjacent storefront to a marijuana dispensary. The idea is to create an environment that functions as a harmonious whole. Tenants should complement, not torment, each other. And your property should become the place they want to call home. Money doesn’t equal motivation. So before you buy your first property, take a look in the mirror and ask yourself a few questions. What will drive you to meet the highest standards? How will you stay motivated to outperform the competition? One thing is certain – succeeding in the real-estate market will demand a great deal of effort and time, as well as an unwillingness to quit. What will keep you going? Sure, money may seem like a sufficient motivator, and it’s certainly a major incentive for many investors. But the author firmly believes that, in the long term, cash will let you down. The promise of money, though enticing at first, will seem less and less grand as the years go by. And besides, the early days of running a real-estate business usually aren’t very profitable. So it’s doubly important to find a non-monetary purpose that underpins your real-estate business. Here are a few probing questions that may help you tease out your purpose: Why are you personally attracted to the real-estate industry? Do you like the idea of assisting others? Is it satisfying to think that you might be helping people find a place to work or live – that your property might improve their lives, and, by extension, the surrounding community? Now that you’ve identified the purpose behind your real-estate business, it’s time to organize your company values around it. As your real-estate business grows, your company values will become increasingly important. They’ll not only affect employee decisions and behavior; they’ll also determine your company culture and the way you do business. So it’s of the utmost importance that you establish and nurture them from day one. For instance, the author’s company values are excellence, creativity and integrity – and, when the going has gotten tough, these values kept him and his workers on track. Instead of getting bogged down or burned out, they continued to find their work meaningful and pleasurable, thanks in large part to the company’s solid set of values. The author was once tempted to sell all his properties. All of them were finally profitable, and the thought of cashing out had such appeal that he even discussed selling with an interested buyer. In the end, however, he decided against it. Why? Well, he knew that, in order to create truly lasting value, he had to stay in it for the long haul. It takes time to increase a property’s value, especially if the property itself is generating the funds being used for its improvement. Imagine you’ve decided to boost your property’s value by making its utilities more efficient. And the first steps you take are to insulate the water pipes, thus increasing their ability to retain heat, and install water reducers on the building’s showers, thus cutting water usage and costs. Now, this will save you money in the long term – fewer expenses equates to a higher net operating income – but, in the short term, it represents a financial loss, because of the expense associated with each improvement. So, if you really want your property to reach its full value potential, you’ve got to hold on to it for a while. “A while” means, as a general rule of thumb, about five years – though it could take even longer. Furthermore, if you want to convince a buyer that your property is worth a high price, you’ll have to provide proof that its financials are solid. This means showing them a track record of profitability that’s at least two years long. If you can’t do this, you’ll be unable to make a case for a high property valuation. If these arguments aren’t convincing enough, here’s another benefit of holding on to your property for a long time: it minimizes transaction costs. If you sell a property, you’ll be looking at transaction costs somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of the property’s selling price. And that’s not taking into consideration the large commission you’ll probably have to pay a real-estate broker. Also, any capital gains from the property sale are subject to taxes. Holding on to your properties will enable you to avoid all of these costs. So it’s best to sit tight and await the day when your business is so valuable that selling makes perfect financial sense. With the right amount of patience, as well as a do-it-yourself attitude and a positive vision for the future, the author succeeded in making a fortune through his real-estate investments. So, adopt the right attitude for success, roll up your sleeves and get started! The key message in these blinks: Investing in real estate can make you wealthy. But you’ve got to play it smart and follow certain principles. In order to succeed, you should treat your investment like a proper business rather than a passive investment. It’s also wise to hold on to your properties for as long as possible. Most importantly of all, always be on the lookout for ways to save money. The easiest way to do that is to personally take care of as much property-related business as you can. Actionable advice: Add value to your property by rethinking how it’s used. One of the best ways to increase the value of your property is to change how it’s used. For instance, a property can often be partly or entirely repurposed. Underutilized common space can be converted into leasable space. You could upgrade storage space to office space, or two one-bedroom flats could be created out of a three-bedroom flat. For instance, in 2017, the author purchased a failing hotel and successfully converted it into studio apartments. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Cryptoassets",
    "author": "Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar",
    "summary": "At the time of writing, cryptocurrencies are a hot topic of debate. Some say cryptoassets are the way of the future, and the time to get in is now. Others will tell you they’re a fad, and that investing in Bitcoin is just a fancy way of throwing your money out the window. So who’s right? Or maybe all this crypto-talk is Greek to you, and you’re still wondering what exactly a cryptoasset is? Either way, these blinks offer some answers, giving you a short history of Bitcoin and blockchain technology as well as some handy investment tips and cautionary advice. The future of finance is already here; the only question is how long it will take for the world to recognize it. These are certainly exciting times, but a word to the wise: the landscape of cryptoassets is changing rapidly, so be sure to take the author’s advice and do plenty of research yourself. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the mysterious origins of Bitcoin; what to watch for in a white paper; and what makes a wallet “hot.” Unless you’ve been living in a cave on an abandoned island, you’ve probably heard about Bitcoin by now. In the last few years, it’s been all over the news, as have a handful of other cryptoassets – an unprecedented digital asset class that presents some thrilling new opportunities, both for experienced and amateur investors. Here’s a narrower definition of a cryptoasset: a commodity consisting of software and an accompanying currency. OK, but what exactly determines a cryptoasset’s value? Well, the value of cryptoassets – just like the value of other commodities such as gold or oil – depends partly on market supply and demand. Unlike gold and oil, however, cryptoassets are intangible, and so it’s the value of the software (not of a physical resource) that goes up and down in tandem with the peaks and valleys of the market. Let’s take a look at Bitcoin to get a better idea of how this works. Bitcoin, like all cryptoassets, consists of software and an associated currency, “bitcoin” – and therefore, unlike other, non-cryptoassets, it doesn’t fall into a single asset class. Let’s contrast this with oil, which is classed as a consumable/transformable asset (or c/t asset) – an asset usually bought so that something else can be made from it. Well, the software component of Bitcoin works similarly as it can be used for a number of different purposes. Bitcoin, the currency, however, is similar to another asset; gold, which is classed as a store-of-value asset. Since gold is rare, beautiful and useful, people worldwide have agreed on its value. Cryptoassets function somewhat similarly – like gold, and unlike government-issued money, there is a finite amount of each cryptoasset’s currency. So plenty of people buy bitcoin without intention of trading it. Rather, they leave it alone and let it appreciate value over time, as one might do with gold or any other precious metal. Hence, the cryptocurrencies that succeed will be the ones that are both useful and work as a store of value. As mentioned at the beginning of the blink, cryptoassets are an asset class unto themselves, but the fact that they fit into multiple preexisting classes only makes them both that much more enticing – not to mention valuable – to today’s investors. Bitcoin, like all other cryptoassets, is supported by blockchain technology – a term that is more often bandied about than actually understood. So how do blockchains work? Well, a blockchain is basically a massive digital database that records how much of a particular cryptoasset is owned by whom. Unlike bank databases, however, or those of centralized governments – which typically oversee the transactions of a given population – blockchain databases are decentralized. They’re constantly updated and operated entirely by the millions of people who’re running the relevant software on their computers. Let’s say you decide to download Bitcoin’s software. What are the properties of the blockchain you’d be helping to support? First, it’s distributed – meaning, it’s public and any computer, anywhere, can access it. Second, it’s cryptographic – that is, all data is encrypted with an infallible computer-generated code. Third, it’s immutable: it’s impossible to delete anything from it since the blockchain database is continuously being synced with, and recorded on, a worldwide network of personal computers. Finally, it’s always growing. Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded and added to the blockchain database – and each addition forms a new “block.” The computers that record these transactions on the database are called miners, and whichever one adds the new block gets paid in bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, miners are in constant competition, trying to record new transactions faster than each other. Since the deletion of anything from a given blockchain requires the unanimous approval of everyone running that blockchain’s software, and since that software is often public, getting away with underhand dealings is much harder. Numbers don’t lie. And since a transaction will only go through once it’s been verified by every synced blockchain database, it’s almost impossible for a single person – or even a well-organized group of criminals – to cover up any foul play. Even if someone succeeded in illicitly transferring a bunch of bitcoin to his account, that success would be short-lived. The blockchain databases would soon fail to sync up, and his misdeed would be spotted. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptoasset, and its currency is worth the most because it was the first one on the market. But there are tons of other cryptoassets out there, and new ones are constantly being created. Bitcoin’s genesis is tinged with mystery. Bitcoin’s – and, by extension, the blockchain technology’s – inventor is said to be a man named Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Nakamoto’s identity has yet to be verified, and there are those who believe “him” to be a group of people. Adding an air of eeriness to these obscure origins, Bitcoin’s birthday is on Halloween: in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin entered the market on October 31, presenting an alternative to the financial system that had just failed. Writings credited to Nakamoto make clear that Bitcoin was intended to be decentralized (that is, under no single entity’s control) and that, instead of being based on trust, its functioning would rely on mathematical proof. After the 2008 financial crisis, a general atmosphere of anger and disillusionment gripped the world. Frustrated with the global financial system, people were enthusiastic about possible solutions – which is precisely what Bitcoin seemed to be. Thus, Bitcoin gained traction and, over the last decade, became what it is today. But the Bitcoin model isn’t the only way to do things. Other cryptoassets have forged their own paths, either serving different functions or using private blockchains. The most prominent example is Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which uses its blockchain solely for financial transactions, Ethereum uses its to distribute, and enable the collaborative creation of, open-source software. And its “native asset,” or currency, is called “ether.” The Ethereum blockchain, like Bitcoin’s, is public, however – which isn’t the case for all cryptoassets. Monero and Zcash, for example, both use private blockchains, which means that you’ve got to have special permission to access the blockchain. Generally, financial services have chosen to adopt private blockchains – Monero and Zcash are both currencies – because they both want to take advantage of blockchain technology’s efficiency and maintain privacy in their financial dealings. Have you ever considered putting money in the stock market? It’s scary – because, to the uninformed, and even to those in the know, it’s very hard to predict what will happen. One would think, therefore, that investing in cryptoassets, which are relatively young and volatile, would be extremely dicey. But it’s actually a pretty safe bet. Cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, and the blockchain technology they’re supported by, may completely transform the financial world. Just as email all but ousted snail mail, blockchain technology may topple traditional, centralized banking systems. If you missed out on the dot-com boom of the late nineties and early aughts – if you weren’t one of the people who invested in eBay or Google when they were still obscure startups – then blockchain technology might be your mulligan. As an asset, Bitcoin is still in its infancy. A single bitcoin may be pretty pricey today, but the author predicts a great deal of future price appreciation. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s volatility – that is, the fluctuations in its valuation – has diminished; it’s a stabler asset now, and though you probably won’t get the exponential returns of someone who bought ten-dollars worth of bitcoin back in 2010, you probably won’t face major losses, either. And Bitcoin should only become more popular. Currently, most mainstream businesses don’t accept bitcoins, making it inconvenient for users. But once Bitcoin gains more traction and usability increases, demand will begin to rise – and Bitcoin’s price will go up, too. In the meantime, younger cryptoassets, such as Ethereum, continue to be volatile, a state in which they’ll remain until their undergirding value and support systems prove reliable. So beware: before you make an investment, familiarize yourself with the risks. Otherwise, you won’t be taking advantage of an opportunity; you’ll simply be gambling with your money. Hold your horses! Before you withdraw your life savings and invest it all in cryptoassets, let’s take a detailed look at some of the dangers that go hand in hand with investment. Danger number one: the speculation of crowds problem. In less technical language, it’s the danger of monkey see, monkey do. This danger arises when tons of amateur speculators begin investing because they see other people doing it. None of them really knows much about the actual worth of the asset they’re investing in or has considered the rationality of their investment. They’re simply hopping on the bandwagon. This usually happens when professional speculators, who, unlike investors, aren’t interested in the true merit of a particular asset, begin buying it up. These people are simply there to make a profit, and so they try to buy when prices are low and sell when prices are high. Now, if a lot of speculators begin buying up a single cryptoasset, causing the price to rise, then other, less experienced speculators might get inspired to buy, too. If the cryptoasset then somehow fails or proves to be flawed, or if the professional speculators suddenly sell, these amateur speculators stand to lose a great deal of money. Danger number two might be referred to as the “this time it’s different” mentality. Some people will say that markets learn from their mistakes, and so, this time, there will be greater stability. Some people will say that cryptoassets are unlike anything that’s ever been seen before, and so, this time, the old rules don’t apply. On one level, these people would be right – cryptoassets are different. But that’s no reason to let common sense go by the board. Sure, it’s not easy to put a value on a cryptoasset. They’re simply too new and too unlike traditional assets. But, as will soon be revealed, there are some pretty reliable methods for determining any cryptoasset’s underlying value. So just remember: informed investors are well aware of the potentially massive benefits – both financial and otherwise – that cryptoassets have to offer. But they’re equally aware of the potential dangers of investing. Now that you’re familiar with the dangers of investing let’s explore some of the finer points of investment. When building your investment portfolio, there are two things that should be at the forefront of your mind: correlation and diversification. Investments should work together, with each asset complementing all the others. Now, you probably won’t be surprised to learn that different assets react to the market in different ways. So, for instance, stocks don’t respond to the economy in the same way as bonds. When the economy is doing well, stock prices rise and bond prices drop. Why? Well, in a booming economy, investors want to put their money to use on the stock market, not tuck it away in bonds, which are typically more secure. The degree to which any asset’s response to the market differs from that of any other asset can be described in terms of correlation. For instance, stocks and bonds have negative correlation – that is, they respond to the economic events in opposite ways. This is desirable, but not ideal. The best kind of correlation is zero correlation, when a particular kind of economic event affects one asset but none of the others, and vice versa. And this is where diversification comes in. For instance, having a portfolio made up of both stocks and bonds is an example of diversification, and it’s a wise move, since you’ll be prepared to weather both booms and busts. But there’s one more kind of correlation – positive correlation, which, in down-home terms, is the same as putting all your eggs in one basket. It’s when the same economic event affects all your assets in the same way. With cryptoassets, it’s much easier to avoid positive correlation and overall risk because it’s easier to diversify.   For instance, let’s say you’ve already got a stocks-and-bonds portfolio. You could increase diversification by adding cryptoassets, thereby protecting yourself against traditional market failures, which will probably have little effect on your cryptoassets. Either there will be no effect, because most cryptoassets are zero correlated with traditional markets, or your cryptoassets may increase in value, because people might get frustrated with the stock market and turn to cryptocurrencies. Either way, you win. Maybe you’re feeling ready to buy your first cryptoassets. It seems like the way of the future, and you have a clear enough idea of how to avoid the pitfalls of investment. Well, to buy your first cryptoassets, you’ll have to get an account on an exchange site such as Bitstamp or GDAX. At the moment, ether and bitcoin can be bought with fiat currency – that is, money with a government-assigned value, such as euros or dollars – or with (some) other cryptocurrencies. Most cryptocurrencies can’t be bought with fiat currency, because exchanges don’t want cryptocurrencies to become widely available before their stability is thoroughly established. But once you’ve bought some ether or bitcoin, you can use them to purchase any other cryptoasset. Part of what makes cryptocurrencies so useful is how quickly they can be transferred. Unlike fiat currency, which must be transferred from one bank to another, cryptocurrency is a money-over-internet-protocol (MoIP) utility and can, therefore, be sent to another computer instantly. Before you start trading, though, you should get a sense of the strength of the currency you want to buy. One way to do this is to look at the cryptoasset’s trading pair diversity, which is measured by how many fiat currencies and/or cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase that cryptoasset. The more pairs a cryptoasset has, the more robust and reliable it is – especially when it’s paired with fiat currency. To see which cryptoassets are paired with which fiat and/or cryptocurrencies, check out the website CryptoCompare. Be smart about your investment. Don’t rush in because everyone is saying, “Buy! Buy! Buy!” Take a moment, do some research and only part with your money once you’ve familiarized yourself with the market. Let’s imagine you did it – you took the plunge and bought your first cryptoasset. That’s very exciting, but what now? Where does it get stored and how do you access it? Well, that’s partially up to you. Each cryptoasset has a private key that enables you to transfer it to other people who possess their own private keys, so all that storage really involves is keeping this key safe. There are two ways to do this – one will make your cryptoasset more accessible but keep it less safe; the other will keep it safer but make it less accessible. Option number one is called a hot wallet. “Hot,” in this context, means connected to the internet. So your private key would be stored in the cloud, for example, or on a device with internet access. Option number two is cold storage, which just means storing your private key offline. You might use a pin-protected hard drive, for instance, or write down your private key on a piece of paper and store it in a fireproof safe. Both options come with pluses and minuses. If you opt for cold storage, then no one can access your assets without physically stealing your cold-storage device. This is great, because you don’t have to worry about hackers, but it makes it hard for you to quickly access your assets whenever, and from wherever, you want. But if you opt for a hot wallet, you make yourself vulnerable to hackers and cybercrime. The assets you trade on a particular exchange platform can usually be stored on that platform as well, and this benefits you because the storage is usually part hot wallet, part cold storage, with a designated third party protecting your private key. A popular storage option is Coinbase. You can choose between hot wallets and third-party-protected cold storage. But be warned: not all platforms have totally safe storage systems. Look out for the exchanges that tend to store more assets in hot wallets – these are the most likely to get hacked. Let’s imagine you’ve bought a few cryptoassets by now, but you’re still not sure how to calculate the risk that each new investment poses. If you truly want to be an innovative investor, you’ve got to do more than glance at a cryptoasset’s valuation; you must consider its white paper and decentralization edge as well. A cryptoasset’s white paper is the document that explains what it does. It should clearly lay out how it corrects problems facing other cryptoassets and describe, in detail, both how it compares to the competition and how it functions. White papers should be specific, typo-free and easy to understand. Vagueness, spelling errors and inscrutability are all red flags. A cryptoasset’s decentralization edge is basically its usefulness as a decentralized service. Take Swarm City, for example. This app runs on Ethereum and seeks to provide anyone with a chance to set up their own businesses by enabling them to pay and be paid peer to peer, without middle-man companies such as Airbnb and Uber taking a cut. There are three more things an innovative investor will consider: community, developers and issuance model. A trustworthy cryptoasset will be situated within a trusted community and backed by competent developers. In other words, the people working on it should be experienced, and the asset’s community members should be engaged, either investing in the asset or working as miners. Finally, a solid cryptoasset should have a fair issuance model. Issuance models explain native-asset distribution – that is, how much of the currency will be distributed in total – as well as how many miners and developers there will be and how much of the currency will be given to them. Keep a sharp eye out for issuance models that unduly reward miners and developers, thus giving them concentrated power over the asset. Such models are both unfair and dangerous, since other investors will be at the mercy of the whims and poor judgment of the miners/developers. Furthermore, make sure that the initial supply of the cryptoasset isn’t too high. If it is, its value will probably stay low due to market oversaturation. That’s about it. The rest – and how you choose to invest – is up to you! The key message in this book: Cryptoassets present a huge investment opportunity – the kind that’s rarely available to novice investors. But, before you jump into the deep end, you absolutely must familiarize yourself with the market and what it means to invest in cryptoassets.

    "title": "Cut Costs Not Corners",
    "author": "Colin Barrow",
    "summary": "When a company cuts costs, it usually means you can expect shoddier products and worse service. If you’ve ever been on a call with a bank or telecom provider after they had implemented a round of cuts and outsourcing, you may well have spent hours on hold, only to finally speak with a service employee who has no idea how to help you. We’re all justifiably skeptical of companies who cut costs, but decreasing expenses and streamlining operations doesn’t have to mean lower quality products or services. Every business, regardless of its size or customer base, can cut costs in an efficient manner – a way that leads to higher revenues and, crucially, excellent service. These blinks will show you exactly when and where to cut costs, providing an essential introduction to efficient operations for any business. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to oil the wheels of your capital cycle; just how much space every employee needs; and why there’s no use crying over sunk costs. What’s the best way to make maximum profits? The simplest answer is to boost revenue, which of course helps if you can make it happen. But there’s a better and more easily controlled method that’s all about managing expenses. It’s called costs leadership, and here’s how it works: For starters, you’ll need to focus on the two main types of costs: fixed and variable. Fixed costs are independent of the level of a company’s production, and include computers, desks, telephones and other equipment. But the term can also refer to less tangible costs, like rent or insurance. In fact, labor is often considered a fixed cost since it takes time and money to hire employees. Variable costs are dependent on the level of production, meaning that the more you consume, the more you pay. Examples of variable costs are raw materials, packaging and storage. Now that you know the two main types of costs, you can start learning why intelligently managing them will produce lower-cost products, and therefore higher revenues, all while maintaining the same standards of quality. You could reduce costs by making sweeping cuts, but this will likely lower the quality of the goods or services you provide. For example, if you decide to save money by cutting your customer support team, you’re likely to be facing some very unhappy customers in the near future. However, wisely cutting needless costs will both increase revenue and maintain quality. For instance, IKEA’s founder Ingvar Kamprad built his 235-store empire through simple cost-cutting mechanisms that left quality intact. One strategy was to sell unassembled furniture, which takes up less space and requires less time to manufacture. But how can you intelligently cut costs? Let’s look deeper at some specific strategies to reduce expenses while maintaining quality. When entrepreneurs found a new business, they’re often prone to overexcitement and might end up spending money they don’t have. While this mistake is a common one, it can seriously cripple a business before it even gets off the ground. So, it’s key to understand cost management from the start, and a good place to begin is with property. Space is a major expense and a prime target for cost trimming. To get a sense of how much space is enough, keep in mind that the standard is eleven cubic meters per worker. If you’ve got more room than this, you’re likely spending too much money on it. Another great way to cut space costs is through hotdesking, a means to maximize workstations by eliminating individual desks and having employees use whichever one is available. For instance, Stocks, a UK company that manufactures sewing machines, has a sales team of ten people working in a space designed for six. However, the office runs smoothly because the employees spend 60 percent of their time at outside appointments. Alright, now that you’ve maximized your space, it’s time to cut other non-essential costs, and that means outsourcing – in other words, contracting out unessential tasks to other companies. Any activity that’s not central to your business should be tested: if it costs more for you to do it internally than externally, it should be outsourced to someone else that can do it for cheaper. While outsourcing work that’s already being done in-house can be more complicated because capital investments have already been made, it’s essential to do it nonetheless. Say you realize you need to outsource your advertising, but just invested in new marketing design software. Although it may be difficult, it’s important to accept your sunk costs; the money you spent on the software is already gone, but you don’t have to keep wasting money by paying advertising staff. Do you know what the capital cycle is? Well, it’s essential knowledge for any company owner, because every business abides by it. Here’s how it works: You begin with cash in hand, either your own or someone else’s. This money is then used to purchase capital assets and materials that the employees’ work transforms into finished products for sale. You pay your suppliers, are paid by your customers and hopefully have some money left over to repeat. Why is this central to cost reduction? Because low costs require a rapid capital cycle and a focus on the old adage that time is money. For instance, the more money tied up in working capital like stock, the greater the costs going towards things like interest and storage. It’s therefore essential to limit the amount of time that you have stock in your possession. One way to accomplish this is through a limited inventory. Take Wal-Mart, whose stock storage is two-and-a-half times less than the industry average, ensuring an efficient cycle. But negotiations with customers and suppliers can also cut the cost of capital assets. For example, if you sell goods and services on credit, and it takes you 90 days to collect payment from a customer, you’re essentially losing out on any interest that the money would accrue. A better strategy is to set shorter payment periods while disciplining late payers with fines and threats of legal action. On the other side of the coin, if your suppliers offer you credit, it might be tempting to take it. However, depending on the situation, it could make good business sense to pay up front in exchange for a lower total cost. And, of course, it’s essential to avoid paying late, because doing so will give you a bad name in the industry. Increased productivity is a great way to cut variable costs, but that means convincing your employees to get more done – and we all know this is no easy task. Luckily there’s a great strategy for boosting productivity, and it all relies on motivating your staff through your profit margins instead of their turnover; this gets you on the same side as your workers while increasing your own profits. In most companies, the sales team is rewarded for sales they make. This structure causes employees to fixate on cutting deals and costs are often left unchained. A better strategy is to link commissions to company profits, thereby focusing your salesforce on saving money and improving the company’s bottom line. For instance, Atrium, a London-based lighting company, more than doubled its profits by switching to a rewards system tied to gross profit. Their salespeople stopped slashing prices, and instead of coasting on an “anything to please the client” mentality, they invested in cutting extraneous costs and improving efficiency. But money isn’t enough. While a good salary is a major aspect of workplace satisfaction, a fat paycheck alone won’t guarantee that your employees work at optimum efficiency. In fact, job satisfaction is also the result of various cashless motivators, like the feeling of achievement you want your cost-cutting workers to feel. But how can you accomplish this? One way is by simply taking note of the effort your employees are making. In fact, a mere “thank you” e-mail or staff dinner party following a major project can go a long way toward motivating your team without breaking the bank! Every growing business is sure to face the challenge of financing costs, and it’s essential to bring these under control before they start eating into your profits. Financing costs – that is, the cost of raising money – arise due to interest and other fees. It’s important to identify ways to actually obtain money at little or no cost. One strategy is to go to government agencies or certain businesses, like banks and newspapers, that might have an interest in particular business activities taking place in a specific area; this could lead them to contribute money or offer benefits to your company. For instance, every year there are thousands of awards given out around the world to new or small businesses. The majority of these are based around a business plan like the HSBC’s Start-up Awards which grants up to £25,000. Another approach is to ask family and friends for money. This technique is beneficial because you avoid conforming to formalized and time-consuming procedures while also being afforded more flexible terms. However, it’s essential that you explain any and all risks to such funders because the last thing you want is for a helpful friend or family member to suffer economic hardship due to your failed financial commitments. The third and final strategy is to negotiate with banks for more favorable terms. But to do so you need both the necessary know-how and a business plan. In the end, banks are subject to the same macroeconomic factors and pressure to turn a profit as you are, so it’s wise to seek out a bank that’s in good financial condition, as they’ll be able to offer you a better rate. One way to do so is by reading the financial section of the newspaper and keeping in mind that the interest rates tend to be from three percent to nine percent. Naturally you should be shooting for the lower end of the range and should shop around until you get there. If catastrophe strikes your company, cutting costs is likely the first measure you’ll take. Sometimes this can mean making difficult decisions to keep your business afloat, and we all know that extreme times can call for extreme measures. One such strategy is trading debt for equity, because offloading debt can sometimes be worth an major chunk of your company. For instance, the luggage company Samsonite traded a whopping 60 percent of its shares to CVC Capital Partners, one of Europe’s largest private equity groups, in exchange for the payment of a debt worth nearly $175 million. Another extreme measure is to relocate your business to a new country to save on taxes. For example, certain countries have very low business tax rates, like the Maldives with a tax rate of nine percent and the United Arab Emirates with one of 15 percent. Compare that to countries with some of the highest rates, like Italy where the business tax rate is 76 percent or India where it’s 86 percent. But no matter what action you take in a crisis, firing your employees is never the smartest option; businesses with insecure staff fare far worse. Why? Well, being fired is the main source of fear for any employee, affecting both their productivity and the quality of their work. In fact, firing people can even cause valuable employees to look for ways out of a company they view as a sinking ship. However, employees are also willing to make sacrifices that save the company money, if doing so will guarantee them a job. For instance, in June 2009, British Airways convinced 6,940 employees to take voluntary unpaid leave – a move that saved the company $16.7 million as well as the long-term jobs of those workers. And, of course, there’s the measure of last resort: cut and run. After all, failure is just a fact of business, and in the United Kingdom alone, 400,000 businesses close their doors every year! So remember, getting out of an unprofitable business, if done well, can leave you in better shape to start another. The key message in this book: Some people view cost-cutting as an emergency measure, but a long-term expense-reduction strategy is actually essential to boosting the profit margins of any company. Managing your costs effectively will also help you build a business that is prepared to face any crisis or difficult situation. Actionable advice: Apply zero-base budgets. Generally the first thing a company does when drafting its annual budget is determine how much money each department will need for the year. So, if you spent $60,000 on marketing last year to produce $4 million in sales, it might seem logical to spend $90,000 this year for a sales target of $6 million. However, zero-base budgeting doesn’t assume that last year’s money was spent intelligently and efficiently. Rather, it assumes that every year, each department of your company should start from scratch and present arguments for every dime you allocate. This way you can keep tabs on the changing nature of your business and budget! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Disney U",
    "author": "Doug Lipp",
    "summary": "Today, most children dream of going to Disneyland or Disneyworld, where they hope to meet one of their heroes – someone like Peter Pan or Snow White or Cinderella. And consider this: that was also the dream of children a generation ago – to meet a favorite Disney character at a theme park. How has one company managed to do this? How has Disney managed to stay at the heart of Western culture for well over half a century? The answer lies, partly, in the amazing way they train their staff at Disney University. In this special place, Disney employees are taught all they will ever need to know about treating customers like VIPs. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to do that, too. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why Disney managers held crucial meetings in Cinderella’s Castle; why great customer service is a mixture of art and science; and why you can’t buy alcohol at Disneyland Tokyo, but can at Disneyland Paris. The employees are the most important part of any business, especially in a customer-focused industry. You can't achieve success without a well-trained, motivated and happy staff. So keep your workforce happy by providing them with values, not just physical goods. Most companies fail here because they assume they can motivate their employees solely with pay or bonuses or little perks. They don't realize they need to share the company's values with them, too. If your employees don't care about your company's values, they won't be interested in its progress or stakeholders. They'll only be concerned with their own material needs. Disney strives to avoid this. They carefully promote the company's philosophy at Disney University, where staff (or cast members, in Disney terms) is trained. The cast members come to share the company's values, so they feel a much deeper connection to it. You also need to keep your employees happy. The best way to do this is to ensure that the management stays in close contact with them. The management should know immediately if the employees encounter any problems. Van France, the founder of Disney University, used to take walks through the institution to see how the cast members were doing. During one of his walks, he noticed a problem with the orientation program for newly hired members: the company and its parks had expanded so quickly that trainees were struggling under the old orientation program, which had become too small. It was out of date. So France developed a new orientation program that was more suited to the needs of the company and its trainees. The management should always be aware of the organization's inner workings, and seek out ways to make work more efficient and enjoyable. Is building a successful business a science or an art? Well, it's really a combination of both. Your organization's “scientific side” is about its infrastructure and physical products. For Disney, that means building and maintaining the parks and attractions. Disney's success largely depends on the layout of their parks, and on their quality, cleanliness and exciting rides. But great infrastructure and well-engineered roller coasters aren't enough on their own. That's where Disney's artistic side comes in! A business's artistic side is what gives it that special touch that sets it apart. The staff holds the key to the business's “art.” After all, it's up to the staff to make the customer’s experience special, and that’s what makes all the difference at Disneyland. Disney approaches this challenge and maintains their artistry in several ways. First, they teach the staff the interpersonal skills they need to have positive interactions with customers. Children tend to be very excited about visiting Disneyland because they get to meet their heroes, like Snow White or Donald Duck; clearly, the cast members who play those characters have a lot to live up to. They need extensive training. Cast members who play Disney characters also have to adapt to being surrounded by an audience at all times, and they need to know how to interact with guests of all ages. Disney performers also need a lot of technical skill. The guests should feel like they're walking through a fairy tale when they're in a park, so Disney wants their actors to seem like living film characters. The actor playing Snow White has to know how her every movement ought to look. She literally has to transform into the character. You can probably name a few companies that once dominated their market but eventually fell into bankruptcy. Nokia, Kodak, Blockbuster – each suffered this fate. Why? Companies often collapse when they fail to keep up with changes. They cling to the business practices that once made them successful, even when those practices no longer work. A company can also fail if it changes too quickly, however. If it abandons strategies that work and adopts new ones that don't, the company risks destroying itself. So how do you find the balance between changing and staying the same? Here's Disney's key: keep one foot in the past and one in the future. Naturally, Disney keeps up with the latest in animation, and its parks are highly advanced. But no company values its history more than Disney. When Walt Disney died, for example, the company knew they had to keep his spirit alive. So they organized a new program to uphold the Disney tradition, where newly hired cast members could learn about the company. They learned how it got its start and what made it so great in the first place. Preserving the past and moving into the future are equally important, but they're both useless without another critical tool: feedback! You'll never be successful if you don't receive ongoing feedback from the people working with you. When a Disney executive visited one of these tradition programs - called Disney Traditions - he noticed a flaw. The first questions the newly hired members asked were about work schedules, salary and what their costumes looked like. The tradition program, however, taught them first about the company. So the executive changed the order of the program. When new employees got their personal information first, they were much more engaged in learning about the company, because they saw themselves as a part of it. Language is what sets humans apart from other living creatures, but businesses often fail to cash in on its potential. They fall back on boring jargon, like “dynamism,” “energizing” or “going the extra mile.” Those words aren't engaging! If you want to use really great business language, you need to step it up! Use a trick called the language of success to make your customers and employees feel more valued. That means using unique language that sets your company apart from all the others. Small changes make a difference: Disney uses its own special names for various parts of the company. Employees are cast members and customers are guests. Disney parks don't have “crowds” – they have an audience. These terms might sound odd, but they really do change the way the employees and customers feel; Disney's unique language immerses them in the magic of the Disney environment. Disney adapted these terms to suit the branches of their company that speak different languages as well. If you want your company to succeed globally, you have to take the time and care to make sure that it resonates with people of different cultures. For example Disney parks in different countries have different rules. When Disney opened Tokyo Disneyland, they maintained the drinking rules that are enforced in the US: no alcohol anywhere in the park. Japanese people responded well to this and many wrote letters to Disney thanking them for it. One housewife wrote that her husband wouldn't have spent time with her and their children if the park had sold sake. The alcohol rule didn't go over well in France, however. The French press criticized Disney for their insensitivity to French culture, so wine is now allowed at the park in Paris. Running a company is a bit like being married. There are always ups and downs, and times when you just want to give up. It's not possible for a business to avoid these difficult times. So what do you do when they hit? Even a company as strong and well structured as Disney faces problems. In 1971, for example, Roy Disney, the company's inspirational leader, died a mere two months after Walt Disney World was opened. His death was very hard on the cast members, as many of them had been close to him. Understandably, the cast was generally demoralized and struggled to focus on their work or perform with smiling faces. When you reach a tough period like this, the best thing to do is have everyone come together and work it out as a group. Don't give up! Gather your team and have everyone share their ideas on how to make the situation better. Try to get something positive out of it. When Roy Disney died, the managers held emergency meetings in the tower of Cinderella's Castle. They discussed the issue and collected feedback from everyone on the team, and eventually came up with some ideas for reinvigorating the company and its employees, like improving the staff training and HR department. In the end, the company only became stronger. And there's another reason that running a business is like being married: one of the keys to a successful marriage is to not think of yourself all the time. Instead, think about what you have to give. In business, this means you shouldn't focus only on money and profit. You also have to help your staff have fun! Walt Disney understood this well. His motto was “Work hard, play hard,” and he was always ready to plan fun events for his staff and let them enjoy themselves. The key message in this book: A company's character and strength depends on its staff. Disney understands this well. They give their employees more than just a good salary; they include them in the Disney magic by sharing their values and making them understand the legacy they're a part of. Disney holds onto traditions and looks for new ideas, and they work together through difficult times. Even if your organization isn't as big as Disney, you can still incorporate many of their successful ideas. Actionable advice: Have fun! Van France, the man responsible for Disney's unique training process, once said, “The business we’re in, if we can’t have fun, how could we expect the public to have fun?” So help your staff enjoy themselves! They won't just feel better; they'll be more productive workers, too.

    "title": "Dollars and Sense",
    "author": "Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler",
    "summary": "Money. We can’t live without it yet can’t seem to get any of it into our savings accounts either. Don’t worry, this isn’t a unique problem – there are many reasons why people are lousy at spending money wisely and putting it away for the future. As you’ll learn in the blinks ahead, the reason most of us struggle with money boils down to fundamental human characteristics that are difficult to avoid and the unusual concept of money itself. So don’t be too hard on yourself if you have the habit of making irrational decisions when it comes to money. We’re often driven by emotions rather than common sense, but that doesn’t mean we can’t make an effort to understand our flaws and take measures to combat them. In these blinks you’ll find out how being less misleading about their prices was a bad idea for JCPenney; the difference between mental and emotional accounting; and what a Ulysses contract is and how it can help you save money. Money is an abstract concept. What a piece of paper with some writing on it can buy you today could very well change tomorrow. Even though its value may fluctuate, there’s no doubt that you need money for just about everything it takes to get by in day-to-day life. While everyone knows money is important, that doesn’t stop us from routinely making bad spending decisions. So what gives? One reason is that when we get an urge to buy something, we rarely stop to think about what else we could be spending that money on. In economics, all the other things we could buy are known as opportunity costs, and our failure to consider these alternatives is one of the biggest financial mistakes we make. A few years ago, Ariely, one of the authors, talked to customers at a Toyota dealership and asked them what purchases they were giving up to buy a new car. What he mostly got back in return were confused looks. After explaining his question further, a lot of people said they were giving up the chance to buy a different car. Only a few made the connection that they were sacrificing opportunities such as taking vacations or treating themselves to meals in expensive restaurants. Ariely realized that for most people, considering alternatives just didn’t come naturally. Another reason behind irrational spending is an overreliance on value cues. These are external hints and signs suggesting an item’s real value. If we behaved in a perfectly rational manner, we’d determine an item’s value through opportunity costs by weighing up one purchase against another. Instead, we go the less rational route, relying on value cues and paying attention to signs that say something is “a bargain” or “a limited-time offer.” At car dealerships, the language of the salespeople is filled with these sorts of value cues, designed to get customers to buy now or miss out on a “spectacular opportunity.” While there are helpful value cues that can give you a better sense of what something’s worth, they’re often misleading, as companies routinely use deceptive practices to skew your sense of value and take your money. Think of all the different cars and houses you pass by every day: Do you know how much they cost? In many cases, value is difficult to determine simply by looking at something. Take a pair of shoes. To determine their value would require looking at many different factors, like the cost of the materials, labor, shipping costs etc. Therefore, in order to come to a conclusion, we tend to apply mental shortcuts, such as comparing one item or price to another. Comparison shopping can help us determine a relative value between similar things, but this too can be misleading. In 2012, the routine practice at popular department store chain JCPenney was to mark up the regular prices, then have coupons, discounts and sales to bring them back down to actual retail value. As a result, customers used the coupons and sales as value cues to think they were getting a special bargain. That year, Ron Johnson took over as CEO. Johnson didn’t like the misleading practice, deciding that the regular prices should be “fair and square.” He got rid of all the discounts and lowered prices to their normal retail value. Customers were not happy. After just one year of the changes, JCPenney lost $985 million and Johnson was fired. For customers, the sales and coupons were important value cues that made them feel like they were getting bargains, even if they weren’t. Without these cues, there was no sense of getting a good deal. But often we don’t need companies to deceive us with misleading sales – we’re pretty good at deceiving ourselves. In his book Mindless Eating, author Brian Wansink describes an experiment which shows how people’s appetites can have little to do with how hungry they really are. Wansink attached bowls to a table in a way that allowed him to add more soup to the bowls without participants realizing, and asked his unsuspecting test subjects to eat until they were no longer hungry. Some did just that and stopped after eating a certain amount, but others just kept on eating and eating. The experiment showed that, as long as there was food in the bowl, some participants would continue to insist they were hungry. They needed to see that empty bowl before they could decide that they were no longer hungry. Research shows that we rely on cues like this to make all kinds of decisions. Here are two interesting “what if” scenarios: What if you paid $100 for a concert ticket, but as you’re riding in a car on the way to the show, the ticket flies out the window and you lose it? If you could buy a new ticket for the same price, would you do it? Conversely, what if you lost a hundred-dollar bill out the window on your way to buy the ticket? Would you take out another $100 and still buy a ticket? We weigh up these kinds of options using mental accounting. It’s a little different for each of us as we have our own categories with their own subjective values. You may value a concert ticket worth $100 differently to a hundred-dollar bill that you’ve yet to spend. The money toward the concert ticket might be in the “already spent” category, while the bill was lost before it got assigned a category, so it can feel like it’s still waiting to be spent. This is why most people say they wouldn’t buy a new ticket but would take out more money if they hadn’t bought one yet. We can see that mental accounting can be irrational, but it can also serve a purpose. Strictly speaking, a rational mind wouldn’t treat these two scenarios differently, since they’re both costing you the same amount of money. But the world is filled with countless options on how to spend money, and so mental accounting can be a valuable time-saving tool, even if it isn’t perfect. If you want to buy a cup of coffee, you wouldn’t look at all the prices, go through all the opportunity costs, and consider every possible option for using that money, even if it might be the most rational thing to do. Instead, it’s useful to use the shortcut of mental accounting, take the money out of your “coffee account” and get on with your day. There’s another type of accounting known as emotional accounting, and this has its fair share of dangers as well. When you attach emotions to money, it can easily influence your spending decisions. For instance, if you got some money from a relative you don’t like, you might try to wash away the negative associations by donating some of it to charity – and then spend the rest frivolously once you felt better about it. In the end, if you get some extra cash, the most sensible things to do is not let your emotions get in the way and just save it. If you’ve ever tried feeding a toddler, you’ll know that language can make things a whole lot easier. Even the pickiest eater can’t resist a spoonful of mashed carrots once you tell them it’s an airplane coming in for landing. Like with the toddler in the highchair, language shapes how we perceive and experience the world around us. How would you feel, for example, about having to live with twenty percent less of your current salary? Now, what do you think about living off of 80 percent of your current salary? What’s the difference? There isn’t one, and yet, as a 1988 study in the Journal of Consumer Research showed, people are far less comfortable with the idea of spending their retirement on 20 percent less of their income than with spending it on 80 percent of their current income. The restaurant industry is very aware of how language can make their food and beverages seem more precious. When a waiter uses words like “complex and earthy notes of oak and tobacco,” they know that customers will be willing to pay $80 for a bottle of wine that they wouldn’t buy at their local grocery store for $30. The authors refer to this language as our consumption vocabulary, which is often linked in our mind to a product’s superior value, such as a wine’s “bouquet” or a quilt’s “sashing.” The word “artisan” has this effect as well – just because a fast-food chain calls their bread “artisan,” it doesn’t mean you should automatically think it’s worth more money. Another way we can add value is through the rituals we create around a product, which tend to enhance our experiences. This is another reason why a glass of wine can seem so precious; as we ritualize the pouring, the swirling, the smelling and, finally, the tasting. Each step gives the experience extra significance. Studies show that when we create rituals around consumption, we perceive the objects related to that consumption to have greater value. In 2013, researchers from the University of Minnesota and Harvard Business School asked participants to either eat a chocolate bar quickly or slowly unwrap and break it into pieces before eating. As you might guess, those who took the slow route were willing to pay more for the chocolate. It’s natural for people to be irrational about money – it’s why everyone’s so eager to find clever ways of budgeting. But all the tips and tricks in the world won’t work if you don’t have self-control. Without it, you’re bound to make bad decisions. One of the best ways to increase your self-control is to start emotionally connecting yourself to the future. You probably know that your future self would be better off if you didn’t sit in front of the TV tonight and eat a pint of ice cream. But that future person usually seems so remote and far away that you give in to temptation anyway. To help resist that temptation, UCLA’s Hal Hershfield suggests going a step further – creating an emotional connection by imagining a conversation or writing a letter to your future self. You can also picture “future-you” appreciating the benefits of your good decision – kicking back and enjoying retirement in comfort thanks to the early investments you’re making today. It also helps to think in terms of fixed dates. According to a 2005 study published in Management Science, we’re more likely to be diligent about putting aside money if we set an exact retirement date. So rather than telling yourself, “this will come in handy in 30 years,” think, “August 23, 2048.” Another way to boost your self-control is to set up Ulysses contracts. As legend has it, in order to get past the Sirens and their alluring-but-deadly songs, famed Greek hero Ulysses had his crew tie him to the mast of his ship. A Ulysses contract is a way to remove temptation by setting up a process or structure whereby a bad decision isn’t even an option. If you’re lousy with credit cards, a good Ulysses contract would be to only use prepaid debit cards. Or, if you’re spending money that should be going toward your savings, reduce the temptation by setting up an automatic deposit that takes a certain amount directly from each paycheck. In 2010, a study published in World Development showed that people who set up automated savings ended up saving 81 percent more in just twelve months! Now that you have a better understanding of why we’re so bad with money, it’s time to stop making excuses and start being more sensible. The key message in these blinks: Whether it’s basic needs like food and shelter, or luxuries like sports cars and exotic vacations, it all takes money, and it can be difficult to achieve anything if you’re constantly making bad decisions. Figuring out how to spend money wisely doesn’t come naturally, and unfortunately, money doesn’t come with an instruction manual. Instead, we’re constantly grappling with misleading value cues and struggling to understand how much things are really worth. But rather than fight against human nature, we can gain some stability by acknowledging our shortcomings and setting up systems that keep us away from our worst instincts. Actionable advice: Replace your complex budget with a simple one. An unhelpful budget can be like a bad diet that makes you obsessively measure and count every calorie. When your budget is too complicated and specific, you’ll just end up quitting in frustration. Instead, figure out how much you can comfortably spend on non-essential items and create a broad category for this called “discretionary spending.” Every week, put that amount on a prepaid debit card and you can stop worrying about overspending.

    "title": "Everyday Millionaires",
    "author": "Chris Hogan",
    "summary": "When the author was in his thirties, he began working with Dave Ramsey, famous for his radio program and best-selling books about fiscal discipline and wealth creation. As a result of this influence, the author became a financial coach and started seeing things in a whole new light. He got out of debt and started building real, lasting wealth. These blinks are inspired by his findings on millionaires – who they are, what they believe and, most importantly, what behaviors brought them to success. They are based on a study by the author and his research team, the largest and most complete ever to be conducted on millionaires. They got in touch with more than 10,000 American millionaires to ask about their habits, their beliefs and their strategies. There are a lot of lies out there about millionaires. It’s time to set things straight, and this is what these blinks aim to do. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should never pay for a brand-name education; the secret to Michael Phelps’ Olympic success; and how to program your financial GPS. There’s a myth out there that the American dream is dead. Some even say the average American can’t get ahead these days. But this isn’t true. It’s a harmful lie that stops people from believing they can achieve their dreams. Hogan has experienced this firsthand. As a black man raised by a single parent in Kentucky, the idea of becoming a millionaire once seemed as far away to him as the stars. But he found that as long as you have an unshakeable belief that you can become a millionaire, then you can. You might encounter people who try to convince you that you won’t make it. But don’t worry – there’s a simple trick that makes these people disappear: prove them wrong. British distance runner Roger Bannister is a great example of this. In his time, the consensus was that a human being simply couldn’t run a mile in under four minutes. There were even people who thought that the strain would make a runner’s heart explode! But Bannister proved them wrong on May 6, 1954, when he ran a mile in three minutes and 59 seconds. And once Roger Bannister had shown that a sub-four-minute mile was possible, other people began to embrace the idea that they could run one too. Six weeks later, someone else even did it faster than Bannister had! Becoming a millionaire is similar. If you look around, you’ll see that others have done it, and it’s possible for you as well. After all, as CNBC Money reported in 2017, there are almost eleven million millionaires in America today! And once you add yourself to that number, don't be ashamed. Millionaires know that they’re winning financially because of hard work, and they’re proud of it. In Hogan’s study, this was made crystal clear. Millionaires believe that winning is always a good thing, not something to be ashamed of. That doesn’t mean that millionaires win every time they try something. It just means that they don’t get stopped by setbacks – they use them as motivation for their next big win! Now, let’s get motivated by doing away with some myths about who millionaires are and what they’re like in the following blinks. We’ve all heard someone say, “I bet that guy’s never done a day of work in his life.” For some reason, people like to assume that wealthy people must have been either incredibly lucky or born with a silver spoon in their mouths to get where they are. But guess what? Most millionaires don’t inherit their money. In fact, 79 percent of those the author interviewed received no inheritance whatsoever. It was hard work, sacrifice and sticking to a plan that got them where they are. Take Thomas, for example. He grew up poor, in a home riddled with alcoholism and dysfunction. Both his parents died young, and by the time he was ready to go to college, he knew that there were two things he wanted to avoid in his life – alcohol and poverty. Thomas got his PhD, but he didn’t jump into a flashy, high-paying job. Instead, he taught math for 37 years. By the time he retired, his net worth was $2.6 million. Thomas became a millionaire on his own steam – he didn't have the luck to inherit a fortune. He saved money steadily by avoiding debt, paying in cash, working extra when possible and investing wisely. People often think when someone's racked up a million or more, luck must have played a role. In reality, they just can't see the hard work behind the accomplishment. Consider the case of swimmer Michael Phelps. He’s the most successful Olympian in history and gifted with a body that’s absolutely perfect for swimming. A lot of people write his success off to luck and good genes. At his peak, though, Phelps was training for up to six hours a day, with just one day off per week. He swam almost fifty miles weekly in addition to serious weight lifting. He knew that all those genetic advantages wouldn’t amount to anything without hard work to back them up. Millionaires aren’t so different. And by assuming that a millionaire’s success is entirely based on luck, you’ll stop yourself from ever becoming one. In reality, there's enough opportunity out there for everyone – luck or no luck, inheritance or none. But you have to believe it. Every single one of the millionaires Hogan has ever spoken with certainly does. They see that opportunities are out there for them, and they have the wisdom to pick the right ones, as we’ll see in the next blink. When you think of a wealthy person, you may think of a flashy Wall Street trader making audacious deals that turn her into a millionaire overnight. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but real life isn’t like that. The idea that wealthy people make risky investments is just a myth. For example, not one of the millionaires in the author’s study mentioned investing in single stocks, and it’s clear to see why – the risk is just too great. When you buy a single stock, you’re putting all of your eggs in one basket. If that stock fails, you can kiss your hard-earned money goodbye. Then there are cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and the like get a lot of press they days. They’re hot, new and they have the potential to make people wildly rich. But cryptocurrencies are literally made-up currency. They’re untested, completely unregulated and no one is accountable for them. They’re 100% risky – the kind of thing most millionaires avoid like the plague. What about the other end of the spectrum? Well, there are low-risk investments like certificates of deposit and bonds. They’re generally very safe bets, but they also tend to be pretty low-reward as a result. Most millionaires don’t buy these – they avoid both the high- and low-risk extremes. In fact, 79 percent of millionaires say that their paths to wealth was very predictable – an employer-sponsored retirement plan. And what did they invest in most often through those plans? Growth stock mutual funds, which balance a reasonable, diversified risk with a good potential for growth. Which brings us to another myth – that millionaires are all about getting rich quick. The truth is, millionaires are in it for the long haul; 95 percent of millionaires took more than ten years to get to where they are today. Most hadn’t earned their first million until they were 49. The whole notion of getting rich quick is just a fantasy, one that takes people’s focus away from proven methods of wealth creation. Even Hogan remembers getting seduced by the promise of quick wealth back in the 1990s. Convinced by a friend’s impressive fast returns, he sunk his money into a single stock – AOL. He soon found out just how risky this was, ending up $25,000 poorer before he finally came to his senses and cut his losses. To get into the millionaire club, you need a prestigious education and a high-status job, right? Well, there’s a kernel of truth in that. But only a kernel. It’s definitely true that most millionaires have a college education. 88 percent of the millionaires in the author’s study have a bachelor’s degree, while a further survey shows that only 33 percent of the general population does. By every measure, a college education is a valuable thing – according to Georgetown University, those with a bachelor’s degree make 74 percent more over the course of their lives than people who only have a high school diploma. But that doesn’t mean that education needs to be a brand-name one. Ask the millionaires – 62 percent of them got their degrees from a public state school. There’s nothing wrong with private schools, of course. They can be a good option for people who can afford them. But a year at the average private school ends up costing about $45,370 in total, according to CNN Money. State schools, on the other hand, are about $20,090. That means that you end up paying twice as much to go to a brand-name school for the same degree. What’s more, many people turn to student loans so that they can attend a private school, one of the worst mistakes you can possibly make. This can’t be overstated – stay away from student loans! They can ruin your life, taking away your ability to save and build interest in those crucial early years of your career. 68 percent of millionaires didn’t take out a penny in student loans, whereas 49 percent of the general population does. Millionaires understood the importance of staying debt-free in their college years so they can start saving money at the start of their careers. These careers, by the way, do not necessarily involve high-paying jobs. That’s another myth about millionaires. In fact, the household income of 30 percent of them has never reached six figures per year. And only about a third of them have made $100,000 a year on average. So, what is it that millionaires do? The top three professions are engineer, accountant and teacher. It turns out that most millionaires are normal people with normal jobs. What sets them apart is their behavior, not their yearly salaries. It seems like the US is filled with crises these days. From the financial crisis to the opioid epidemic, they’re everywhere you look. But no one is talking about the crisis of responsibility that’s plaguing the US today. The sad truth is, most people just don’t take responsibility for managing their finances. Take retirement savings, for example. Hogan’s research team found that while 56 percent of Americans were worried about retirement, few people were actually preparing for it. Half of the baby boomers polled didn’t even have $10,000 saved. And 80 percent of millennials wished they were investing more toward retirement and building a nest egg – but they weren’t actually doing it. So, what’s stopping them? After all, they’re responsible for investing their money. No one else can do it for them. Millionaires understand this. They understand that they are responsible for what happens to them – 97 percent, in fact, say that they alone are in charge of their destinies. They also know that once you’ve taken responsibility for your finances, you can really start your journey toward becoming a millionaire. Just like figuring out a trip on GPS, you start with where you are and where you want to go. Financially, where you are is determined by your net worth. That’s simply everything you own, minus your debts. You need to calculate it precisely before you can have any idea of how you’re doing. Try using a net worth calculator online – there’s even one on the author’s website. Once you have a number in hand, you’ve got that little dot on the map that tells you exactly where you are. Once you know where you are, it’s time to figure out where you want to go. Ask yourself – and your spouse, if you’re married - what exactly you’d like retirement to look like. Where do you want to live? What kind of car do you want to drive? Try to paint a crystal-clear picture. Then it’s time to get down to brass tacks. How much money, exactly, will you need to make your vision a reality? You’ll need to figure out how much to save up, and also how much to put away every month right now to hit that number. Get started today – no one is going to do it for you. How can you spot a millionaire? After all, most millionaires live unassuming lives and wear blue jeans just like the rest of us. Here’s a tip – look at people’s behavior. The millionaires are the ones who do things with intentionality. Intentionality is the difference between deciding and sliding. If you’re sliding through life, you’re not in control. You’re just drifting along without a plan, and at retirement age, you’ll probably realize you don’t have a cent in savings. Deciding, on the other hand, is about being in control and making conscious choices. Take millionaire couple Frank and Alice, who the author spoke to during his study of millionaires. Frank’s father and grandfather were frugal, hard-working German immigrants. They couldn’t imagine living beyond their means or incurring debt, and the example they set for Frank when he was a boy has guided him throughout his life. That means that when he worked on Wall Street, he was intentionally choosing to educate himself about investment and building wealth, rather than spending money on shiny new things. Today, Frank and Alice have a net worth of $6 million, and they got there the old-fashioned way – deciding to spend less than they made and saving for the future, rather than sliding into pricey New York shops. They’re in good company, too. Hogan’s study showed that 94 percent of millionaires keep their expenses lower than their incomes, and 95 percent make saving for big expenses a priority. And how do millionaires manage this financial discipline? It’s simple – they live on a budget. Now, budgets often get a bad name. To a lot of people, they just sound like a financial cage. But a budget isn’t a cage. It’s a tool that allows you to take control of your money. With a budget, you can stretch your hard-earned money further and make it do big things. Also, a budget brings clarity to your finances. It does away with any mystery, shining a bright light on just exactly where every one of your dollars is going. And once you’re aware, you can make better choices. Are you spending more than you need to on groceries every month? Adjust your budget, and you’ve suddenly got extra money in your hands. Finally, a budget puts your money to work – you can give every dollar a job. Take that extra money away from groceries and direct it toward something really important, like giving, saving, investing and eliminating debt. One thing about millionaires is that when they say they’ll do something, they do it. In fact, 97 percent of millionaires reported almost always achieving the goals they set for themselves. Anyone can learn to set goals, and being SMART about it means you’ll actually achieve them. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-sensitive. Specific means that goals need to be high-definition. Specifically, they must be detailed, clear and unambiguous. If you’ve taken the time to craft your specific vision for retirement, this will come into play here. Measurable goals are achieved by hitting clear milestones or metrics, like defining a specific amount that you’ll be setting aside every month. Having these checkpoints means that you’ll know with complete certainty whether or not you’re achieving your goals. Achievable goals are realistic ones. Nothing is impossible, but keeping your goals realistic means that you’ll actually be able to accomplish them! Relevant is the opposite of “random.” You can’t plan to save and take regular vacations and pursue an advanced degree all at the same time. Your major goals should be cohesive, leading specifically toward the life you’re aiming for. Time-Sensitive means having deadlines. If you’re focused on planning for retirement, for example, you should know at exactly what age you want that to happen. Be ambitious with your deadlines – you might be surprised at how hard you’re able to work with a little time pressure applied! Once you’ve gotten SMART, commit to your goals by writing them down. This gives you accountability, and also makes it more likely that you’ll achieve your aims – 42 percent more likely, according to a study by psychology professor Dr. Gail Matthews. Ideally, goals should be a mix of short- and long-term. Short-term goals, like saving for a nice vacation, can be the wins that keep you on track. Long-term goals are the big life-changers. The biggest of these will probably be paying off your house. Once you do so, you transform it from debt liability to 100 percent asset. Now, doing this isn’t easy, by any means. But every year you don’t is a year that you make the bank rich instead of yourself. Imagine paying your mortgage off ten years early. Then, the money you would have put into your mortgage payments has ten more years to make you rich! That’s because you harness the power of compound interest, which we’ll look at closely in the next blink. It’s hard to be patient. Who isn’t tempted by short-term rewards? But millionaires forgo these distractions, building wealth through patience and consistency. And when it comes to consistency, there’s nothing better than the magic of compound interest. There’s even a quote – which many attribute to Albert Einstein – that calls it the most powerful force in the universe! Let’s say you put $1,000 into an investment and find that it’s grown to $1,100 a year later. If you keep the money where it is, then that extra $100 will start accruing interest as well. That’s interest earning interest! And that just snowballs over time, if you’re willing to be patient. But what long-term investment options can you really trust? Hogan’s study proves that the majority of millionaires make their money through the old-school company plan or 401(k). Here’s how you take full advantage of these. Let’s assume that you’re planning on investing the recommended 15 percent of your income toward retirement. The first step is to check to see if your company offers a match on your 401(k). If it does, invest in your 401(k) up to whatever the match amount is – if it’s 5 percent, invest 5 percent. Remember, this is free money, so you want to take advantage of it. Next, put as much as you can into a Roth IRA, which works similarly to a 401(k) but gives you more investment options. Talk to an investment advisor to make this happen. This is worth it because a Roth is an amazing investment tool, one that will grow your nest egg tax-free. You should know, though, that there’s an income limit for Roth IRAs. If you find out that you make more than the current limit, then the best thing is just to invest the entire 15 percent in your 401(k). There’s also a contribution limit to the Roth IRA – once you’ve hit it, then put whatever’s left of your 15 percent in the 401(k). Don’t forget – that 15 percent is just a starting point. Once your mortgage is paid off, you’ll have some extra income, which you should then put toward your 401(k), too. Then, stay true to the plans that you've created to lead you to your ideal life and add the magic ingredient – time. It won’t happen overnight, but slowly, steadily, you too will achieve millionaire status. The key message in these blinks: Millionaires aren’t some rarified class of people. They weren’t born into money and privilege. Instead, they’re regular people who set goals early on in life and were willing to put in the hard work and sacrifice to make those goals happen. Becoming a millionaire is the American dream, and it’s far from dead. In fact, regular people make it happen every day. Actionable advice: Enlist an investment professional. Nobody would go to court and act as their own lawyer, right? Well, you shouldn’t go it alone when building wealth, either. Seek out investment professionals on the internet. The author’s website is one resource for this. Once you’ve got a shortlist, take some time to interview each one. Ask questions about their experience, certifications, philosophy and fees. Finding the right fit will be well worth your time – after all, it’s your wealth. And your life. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "From Here to Financial Happiness",
    "author": "Jonathan Clements",
    "summary": "Financial stability. To say that everyone wants it would be to point out the painfully obvious. But too often it can seem like a distant dream. In reality, though, the desire to have enough money to lead a comfortable life – and enough to see you through retirement – is fulfillable. It’s also probably a lot easier to achieve than you think. In this book-in-blinks, we’ve boiled From Here to Financial Happiness’s 77 chapters down to their essentials. You’ll learn what it takes to set you on the path to not just earning more, but making yourself secure as you do so. It might seem overwhelming, but break down the task into its components and it really isn’t so scary. In this book-in-blinks you’ll learn why regularly using credit cards might not be so bad; how much to set aside for retirement; and why you can blame your impulse purchases on your ancestors.  You don’t have to be a financial advisor to know that no two earners are the same. That means that financial advice is never universally true. However, there are some simple rules that apply to everyone, and it’s these general principles you should follow – if you aren’t already doing so, that is! Before we get down to business, let’s cover one of the basics: compound interest. There’s a good reason saving money makes sense: the amount will rapidly increase thanks to a phenomenon known as compounding. So, say you have savings of $1000 earning 6 percent interest every year. Without compounding, you’d only receive $60 interest every year. You’d only get up to a paltry $2800 after thirty years. But thanks to compounding, the interest you earn each year gets added to the base savings amount. It’s from this new amount that your next year’s interest is then calculated. That means that, after 30 years of compounding, you’d end up with $5,743 rather than only $2,800. The lesson here is clear. Start saving and start earning that interest as soon as possible. It really is worth it. Now that’s out the way, let's turn to those simple rules for healthier finances. If you’re an employee, the first thing to do is to make sure your employer’s retirement savings plan is working for you. Typically, for every dollar you contribute to your retirement plan, your employer will give 50 cents, for up to 6 percent of your salary. So if you contribute the full 6 percent of your salary to the retirement plan, your employer’s contribution will knock that up to 9 percent. Over time, that starts to add up. The second basic rule is never to carry debt on your credit card. That’s because credit card companies often charge up to 20 percent interest on unpaid balances. It might seem obvious, but it’s an easy thing to forget. Pay off your card, otherwise, you’ll be quite literally throwing money away. We’re off to a good start, but now let’s move to the next blink, where we’ll examine even better reasons for saving money. If there’s one thing that keeps people from sleeping at night, it’s sure to be financial worries. And that’s understandable – living from paycheck to paycheck is a recipe for stress. That’s why it’s critical that you try your hardest to set up an emergency fund. Ideally, you should have enough in an emergency fund to cover three to six months of average living expenses. Be sure, also, to keep this money out of easy reach – preferably in a savings account or in the form of very safe investments. The main reason for having a fund such as this is so that you have something to fall back on in case you lose your job. In contrast, if your car or washing machine were to break down, you’d most likely be able to scrape that money together from somewhere. But losing your job is different – losing your major source of income means that you’ll need something to see you through while you look for new employment. You also need to bear in mind that, if your line of work is quite specialized, you’re going to need longer to find a job that fits your specific skill set; simply put, an executive is going to need more time for the job hunt than a waiter. That means you’re going to need a larger emergency fund to see you through.  Thankfully, it’s not that complicated to create an emergency fund. You just need to follow a few basic rules. First off, look at your monthly living costs and work out how big you’ll need your emergency fund to be. Then, apply for a high-yield savings account. Finally, set up your checking account so that it pays an automatic contribution to your new savings account every month. Keep this going until you hit your goal. This method is the easiest way to get your emergency fund growing and ensures that you won’t be spending your liquid assets on too many luxuries like theatre tickets or fancy clothes. The other thing to consider is which expenses you should immediately cut out if you hit hard times. Cutting out restaurants is an obvious solution, but you might even need to consider moving to a cheaper apartment if financial issues seem likely to go on for a while. If we lived our lives meticulously evaluating every decision along the way, making decisions at all would quickly become utterly exhausting. That’s why humans have evolved to operate and react instinctively to the world around them on a day-to-day basis. That’s all well and good, but unfortunately some of our ingrained instincts aren’t such great news for our wallets. Just consider one habit that’s been passed down in our genes. To fully utilize resources, our nomadic ancestors had to forage for food and supplies whenever they had the opportunity. This was necessary for survival in an environment where food and shelter were hard to come by. But we’re still evolutionarily conditioned to do the same, and it’s those same instincts that lead us to overindulge. In a similar vein, our deeply lodged survival instincts mean that we have also come to overvalue hard work as a positive attribute. That’s because our ancestors had to expend huge quantities of energy on hunting and foraging, making them believe in a direct relationship between effort and success.  Now, working hard is, of course, generally a good thing. But if the result is thoughtless over-enthusiasm, then we risk making poor investments. There are plenty of people, for example, who’ve started their own business without proper planning and backing, only for it to end in disaster. So it’s a good idea to counter those misplaced evolutionary impulses that lead to inadequate planning by checking that your finances are in good shape on a regular basis. To do this, you have to first calculate your fixed monthly expenses. This includes things like rent, a mortgage and utilities. These costs should not exceed 50 percent of your total income before taxes. After that, add up your fixed expenses, your monthly tax contributions and the amount you’re setting aside to save each month. As a rule of thumb, at least 12 percent of your income should be going toward your retirement. Now, subtract that combined overall total from your pretax income. What’s left is what you can use for hobbies, vacation and the like. It’s up to you! If you started in on this book-in-blinks hoping to discover a secret to becoming an overnight millionaire, you’re going to be sorely disappointed. The thing is, there is no secret to financial success – it’s nothing more than developing a good set of habits. You just have to learn and implement those habits. An essential component to maintaining sound finances is frugality. You have to keep your expenses low. This can mean anything from getting a less expensive internet package to ditching your gas-guzzling car. But you have to begin somewhere. In addition to this, you have to curb your spending on unnecessary items. These are luxuries that you may not benefit from in the long-term. So there’s no need for a designer couch when a secondhand one will do. And, as for that new hobby you’ve started, maybe it’s better to wait before splurging on that oh-so-essential surfing gear. Money often gets wasted on impulse buys, so think good and hard about what you’re doing before you indulge. There’s also another good reason to be frugal. Odd though it may seem, thriftiness can improve your health. That’s because poor spending habits are often linked to things that are bad for us. These include gambling and drugs such as alcohol, coffee or cigarettes. All of these are addictive in their own way. Now, take a moment to pause, and think about your guilty pleasures and their monetary repercussions. If you often eat more than is healthy, calculate the amount it costs you each day to indulge. And consider the fact that when it comes to smoking, you’re basically burning your money away each day. Sit down and do the math: how much goes out on these unhealthy habits over the course of a year? Once you face the fact that you’re throwing away thousands of dollars each year on unhealthy habits, you might have the incentive you need to finally quit. To an outsider, insurance and insurance policies can seem incomprehensible and confounding. It sometimes comes across as a lot of administrative and technical jargon. But at heart, insurance is both practical and pretty simple. It’s just a way to pool risk. Policyholders contribute money to a pool. This means that if one of the holders gets unlucky, the costs of the misfortune are borne collectively from that pool. However, not all insurance policies are necessary.  If you're a 40-year old professional with a spouse and children, life insurance is a sound idea. If you die early, your family will undoubtedly benefit from any insurance payout and may be able to live a more comfortable life. But once you’ve hit retirement age and your kids are all grown up, paying into a life insurance scheme makes no sense. This model of assessment applies to all your insurance decisions. There are many different types of insurance out there, and very few that are actually applicable to you. For instance, if you’re a young professional, you shouldn’t go without disability insurance. In the event of accident or illness, who’s going to pay the bills when you can’t work? Social Security support takes a lot of work to apply for, and you might be waiting months for that first payment to come through. Short-term or long-term disability insurance is, therefore, worth having. However, your employer may already be paying for your insurance disability costs. In that case, it’s totally unnecessary to buy your own additional disability insurance. Equally, if you’re close to retiring and have upwards of $1 million in your savings account, you can probably do without disability insurance. In those circumstances, should you become disabled, you'll have enough to cover the extra costs of disability without putting your finances under too much strain. Just remember that each case is individual, and you’ll have to judge it for yourself. Think of a purchase that symbolizes career success and what will likely come to mind is an expensive and luxurious car. Sure, it’s a status symbol, but for many the experience of driving a first-class vehicle is simply a lot of fun. As a result, it’s all too easy to overspend on them! For decades, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking how American families spend their money, and their data illustrates this point: A whopping 16 percent of the average American family’s budget goes to transportation - which, in the US, usually means cars. That spending lags in second place, notably, behind housing, which makes up an average of 33 percent of a family’s expenses. Spending too much on driving is clearly a risk. But it’s relatively simple to work out if you’re overdoing it. First off, work out the annual cost of your car. Add up what you spend on it, whether that’s paying for it in installments, gas, insurance, repairs or registration. You should now compare that total with what you make each year. If more than 15 percent of your budget goes toward costs associated with your car, then you’re definitely overspending. And, of course, if you’re throwing away money on your vehicle, that means less is going toward more important items – like your savings. So, what should you do if you’re over that 15 percent threshold? Thankfully, there are some simple enough solutions. First off, take care when the time comes to replace your current vehicle. New cars are expensive, but their value depreciates rapidly during the first two or three years. If you buy a slightly older secondhand car, you can sometimes snag yourself a pretty good deal. It just takes some patience. The further advantage of owning a second-hand vehicle that isn’t worth nearly as much as a new one is that your insurance costs won’t be as high. With that said, don’t switch cars too often, even if the new one runs cheaper: you’ll still have to dish up the cash for sales taxes and new registration fees. Ideally, then, you should be on the lookout for a second-hand vehicle that’s about three years old and has fewer than 30,000 miles on the clock. If you ask anyone about the best methods of increasing wealth, they’ll most likely suggest you look for solid investment opportunities. High-yield savings accounts for retirement are often what spring to mind. But investing isn’t the only way of securing your wealth. To keep your finances healthy, you have to think about how you handle your cash on an everyday basis. First off, take advantage of the rewards that some credit cards offer. When you spend money, use them. Lots of cards give you cash back once you’ve reached a certain threshold. Others reward you with travel points. Needless to say, don’t fall into the trap of spending more just for the points! Another thing to keep an eye on is your checking account. These are low interest, so there’s no point leaving a ton of money in there. Have enough there to cover your daily costs, but anything above that needs to be dispatched into a savings account. There’s a double benefit to transferring that excess checking account money: you’ll both be earning interest on it and less likely to spend it. A savings account is a great start, but that earned interest soon gets eaten away by taxes; a savings account will make you richer, but not significantly so. If you really want your money to work for you, you’ll have to buy some company stock. This simply means that you become a partial owner of a business, as you own a stake in it. But buying stocks is really only an option if you already have robust savings, like a healthy pension and emergency fund. Simply put, if you’re the kind of person who gets into financial difficulties, then you might need to sell off your stocks in a rush. And if you do that at a point when the company is experiencing a slump, you’re going to lose a lot of money overall. However, if you’re able to support yourself and still buy company stock on the side, then it’s certainly worth it. Stocks can have relatively high returns and, if done right, you’ll be increasing your wealth before you know it. Usually, when people get to thinking about money, their thoughts head to the next big thing. That could be putting a down-payment on a house, buying a car or setting up a college fund for the kids. But your first financial priority should actually be about what comes last. At the end of your professional life comes retirement. The reason for that is plain: retirement isn’t optional – not like buying a house! Almost everyone is going to retire, and the gap between retirement and death can be very many years indeed. So there’s no reason to put off saving for retirement. If you wait too long, you’ll need to put aside an awful lot towards your retirement fund for it to function as it should. If you wait as long as your late thirties or early forties, we’re talking around 20 percent of your monthly earnings. And that’s a lot of financial stress. It doesn’t matter if you have student debt, and it makes no difference if you want to save money for a property investment – what comes first should be your retirement plan. Start by paying at least 12 percent of your pretax income toward your plan every month. If that means cutting costs elsewhere, those we looked at earlier, you’ll just have to do that. But of course, saving for your retirement is only one part of the equation. You have to work out what you’ll actually do during that time. It might sound great to be a retiree who goes to the beach or lounges in the sun. But after only a few weeks, that kind of life can get pretty dull. It can even lead to depression. So plot out ahead of time which hobbies you’d really like to get involved in when you’ve got more time on your hands. Ideally, these should be activities that you lose yourself in, where time just flows. So, for, example, if you think playing an instrument might be what you need in retirement, you should start practicing now. By the time you retire, you’ll be proficient enough to enjoy it fully. It will feel like a constructive use of your time and, more than this, you’ll have less chance of getting frustrated by learning an entirely new skill at an advanced age.  So now you've got the lowdown. You now know how to increase your financial happiness, how to plan ahead and how to put aside what you need for your savings. Whether it's an emergency fund or planning for major expenses, you know how to approach the challenge and keep yourself financially happy. The key message in these blinks: The secret to financial happiness is simple, but it isn’t always easy to put into practice. At its most basic, it’s about saving your money – whether by reducing your expenses or putting a set amount into a high-yield account every month. Thankfully, you can achieve this. By reducing your fixed costs, such as your car expenses, giving some thought to your insurance policies and living frugally, you can soon start to amass a healthy stash of money. If you’re then savvy about managing your cash, and invest extra wealth in stock, you can put your money to work for you. Done right, you’ll have not just enough for a comfortable life but enough to last you through retirement, too. Actionable advice: Automate your monthly payments.  Set up your e-banking account so that payments for rent, insurance and all regular bills are automated. Automatic transfers force you to be realistic about your finances, but they also ensure you don’t fall behind on your credit card payments, which would negatively affect your credit score.  Got feedback?

    "title": "100 Million Years Of Food",
    "author": "Stephen Le",
    "summary": "Something is clearly wrong with our eating habits. Today, diet-related diseases plague the Western world. More people suffer from type 2 diabetes, obesity and food allergies, not to mention many forms of cancer, than ever before. But what exactly is wrong with how we’re eating – and what should we be doing instead? The diets of our ancestors provide a few answers. They were generally much healthier than modern-day humans, so it’s no wonder that the last decade has witnessed a major uptick in caveman or paleo diets. But to get a full picture we have to go back even further in time – starting with our earliest, tree-dwelling ancestors 100 million years ago and exploring how these forebears adapted to changing environments and diets. These blinks discuss whether the dietary choices of these distant progenitors would work for us today. On this journey through human evolution, you’ll learn why we should eat some bugs every now and then; about a strange illness that affected mainly the well-off; and why milk isn’t nearly as healthy as you may think. If one of our first ancestors walked into one of today’s supermarkets, he’d be stunned by the options. After all, the difference between the overflowing shelves of contemporary grocery stores and the dinnertime options available to our ancient ancestors could hardly be greater. Our earliest ancestors, who emerged around 100 million years ago, lived in the trees of tropical forests and primarily ate insects. That might sound gross to us now, but insects are actually a calorie-rich source of vitamins and iron. In fact, insects would still make a great addition to the modern human diet. But for us to attempt to live only on bugs wouldn’t be so smart. Our ancestors had enzymes that allowed them to break down the exoskeletons of insects, which are made of chitin, a substance that we can no longer digest. Another problem with eating bugs is that they can trigger allergies and produce harmful toxins. But in moderation, the consumption of insects would be a great boon to modern food production. For instance, crickets produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than cows per pound and convert feed into calories 12 times more efficiently. Nonetheless, our ancestors transitioned away from creepy crawlies around 60 million years ago. Around this time, the climate began cooling and, as the air grew more humid, the first fruit-bearing trees emerged. During the same period, our ancestors lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C, which is essential to preventing cell damage. They only survived this change because they could get plenty of vitamin C from fruit. So around 30 million years ago our ancestors became full-time fruit eaters. However, eating too much fruit can also be bad since fruit contains fructose, something our body can only metabolize so much of; overconsumption can lead to insulin resistance and pancreatic cancer. The actor Ashton Kutcher learned this the hard way. When preparing to portray Steve Jobs, Kutcher followed the tech CEO’s fruitarian diet for a month. After just 30 days, Kutcher was hospitalized with pancreatic issues. About two million years ago, our ancestors began migrating out of the trees and adapting to a terrestrial lifestyle. They started to look more human and their diets changed, too. Around the same time, these early humans began hunting and foraging, eating more meat than they ever had before. As a result, their brains started growing rapidly. In fact, the brain size of our ancestors doubled over the course of just one million years, a change that may well have been the result of their newly carnivorous diets. Meat, packed with important fatty acids, is the perfect fuel for a growing brain. And big brains also gave our ancestors an evolutionary advantage. Smarter, more coordinated groups of hunters could bring home more prey, which meant their families were in turn more likely to survive and reproduce. But while meat has plenty of benefits, eating too much of it is bad for our health. Meat is loaded with protein, which we can only tolerate in limited quantities. When the human body digests proteins, it produces potentially toxic substances called nitrogen compounds. If a person gets more than 40 percent of their daily calories from protein, the levels of these compounds get too high. Another reason excess meat consumption can be detrimental to our health is that it contains a lot of cholesterol, which can combine with other substances and clog up our arteries. But cholesterol isn’t all bad. It’s a precursor to essential sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen, and it also increases the level of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, which is good for our moods. Our livers and intestines produce most of the body’s cholesterol on their own, but animal products like meat and dairy provide additional inputs that affect our hormone levels. As a result, girls on a cholesterol-rich diet reach sexual maturity earlier. That means they can procreate earlier, potentially producing more offspring, but they also have reduced life expectancies. Nowadays, with all the choices available to us, it’s easy to eat a balanced vegetarian diet. But alternatives to red meat are nothing new. Our meat-loving ancestors even branched out. For instance, in many cultures, fish predominated, although not all people developed a taste for it. Here’s how it happened: In many areas where meat was hard to come by, locals embraced fish as an accessible and nutritious food. This was a smart choice since, as we now know, fatty fish contain loads of healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, which is key to bone health. However, not every culture with access to fish chose to eat it. This bias wasn’t merely due to the difficulties of eating fish (all those pesky bones!); there were also cultural reasons. Some cultures regarded fish as a sacred animal that lived in a sacred element. Others, like the Apache Indians, considered fish to be unclean. Another important meat substitute emerged around 8,000 years ago: animal milk. Though it’s often still regarded as an elixir of sorts, animal milk isn’t as healthy for human consumption as some think. The Northern European nations were among the first people to consume animal milk, which has innumerable benefits. It’s nutritious, rich in calcium and whereas an animal can only be eaten once, it can be milked many times over. Statistics link milk consumption to increased growth in children, but this boost in height may come at the price of bone health. This correlation can be seen in the nations with the highest dairy intake; the citizens of these nations, because of their above-average height, also experience the highest rates of hip fractures in the world. A further issue with milk is that people from regions with little history of dairy consumption absorb calcium more efficiently. This means that if a man from, say, Africa drinks a lot of milk, he might experience dangerously elevated calcium levels. This is especially risky since research has linked high blood-calcium levels to prostate cancer. Next up we’ll explore the history of vegetables and their place in the nutritional hierarchy. All parents have insisted, at one time or another, that their kid eat her veggies. After all, veggies are healthy and packed with nutrients, right? Well, the truth is, most plants are actually unhealthy and many are even dangerous. Why? Well, plants are surrounded by other organisms that want to eat them and they have no way to run. Since they can’t escape, they have to defend themselves. They do this by engaging in chemical warfare: producing chemicals that discourage, harm and sometimes kill the animals that try to eat them. For instance, vegetables like squash and cucumbers can contain a bitter substance known as cucurbitacin to discourage consumption, and it’s only the domesticated versions where the excessive bitterness can be bred out. Or take beans, lentils and soybeans, which contain a group of chemicals called lectins. If you eat too many of them, you’ll get sick and you might suffer liver damage. In fact, one of the most lethal poisons known to man is a type of lectin. It’s called ricin and it’s found in the seeds of the castor oil plant. Even a tiny amount of ricin is enough to cause a painful death. So why did humans begin eating plants in the first place? Well, the truth is, we turned to farming and eating plants because the other food options became scarce. This turn toward agriculture occurred around 12,000 years ago in many parts of the world simultaneously. There are lots of theories as to why this happened, but it was primarily caused by the extinction of large, delicious animals such as the mammoth. These creatures likely died due to overhunting by humans and the spread of trees into the grasslands they called home. With the loss of this major food source, humans began looking for other options. They settled on plants because they were readily available and could be easily produced. From that point on, plant-based foods dominated in densely populated areas and places where animals were hard to keep. The human body is surprisingly adaptable and we can get used to big dietary changes. But doing so can take many generations. The slow nature of this process posed a problem when food processing began to become the norm. Humans, with little time to adapt to this change, suddenly faced a variety of new illnesses. For instance, in the second half of the nineteenth century, a frightening disease called beriberi emerged among the richer people of East and Southeast Asia. The affected patients presented with heart issues, mobility problems and mental confusion. In the end, it was discovered that the illness was caused by a severe B1 deficiency. Wealthier people were affected because they could afford the “better” highly polished rice, which had been stripped of most of its B1. Then, around 1900, pellagra became endemic among poorer populations of the American South. These groups had been subsisting on products made from industrially milled corn, which, compared to fresh corn, is extremely low in vitamin B3. The disease caused horrible symptoms like red lesions, weakness and even dementia. Obviously, processed food is an issue, but it’s not the only problem. Other lifestyle changes can also be detrimental to our health. Just take asthma and food allergies, both of which are on the rise. There’s some debate about why, but it’s likely that lifestyle decisions are to blame. After all, most people spend lots of time indoors. As a result, we’re not exposed to much sunlight, and suffer lower levels of vitamin D, also known as the “sunshine vitamin.” This in turn causes human allergies to rise as pregnant women with reduced vitamin D levels are more likely to give birth to allergic children. If you don’t buy that theory, consider the hygiene hypothesis. It postulates that modern day kids develop allergies and asthma because they grow up too clean. The idea is that a child’s immune system needs to be exposed to some germs to learn how to discern harmless proteins from deadly bacteria and fight infections without unnecessarily harming the body. Did you know that Japanese people eat an average of 300 fewer calories per capita than Americans? That sounds healthy, but is it worth following their example? Actually, there are upsides and downsides to limiting your caloric intake. For instance, the Japanese live longer than Americans, but that’s not proof that their way is better. Eating too few calories can deprive your brain of fuel and might cause you to lose focus. Not just that, but consuming too little protein for a period will cause muscle weakness. So it’s a question of trade-offs. For instance, lots of animals, when going through a period of food scarcity, will reduce inessential bodily functions, like reproduction. And the same goes for humans: women who eat fewer calories will live longer, but they’ll be less fertile and more irritable. In fact, even if you’re overweight, counting every calorie isn’t a good idea. For starters, it’s actually healthier to be slightly overweight. For example, people who are a few pounds heavier than average, those with a body mass index between 25 and 30 live longer than people of normal weights. This could be because heavier people have more fat to protect them from toxins and more energy to compensate for weight lost during periods of severe illness. But even if it weren’t healthy to have a few extra pounds, the link between weight and caloric intake is actually weaker than you might expect. The truth is, research has found that slim, modern-day hunter-gatherers eat about as many calories as your average contemporary American and engage in comparable levels of physical activity. The only difference is they have a greater variance in caloric intake over the seasons. Simply put, not all differences in body weight can be chalked up to calories and exercise. And finally, paying attention to your total calories, without considering what type of food they come from, is useless. If all your calories come from junk food and soda, it doesn’t matter how few of them you consume. Imagine your friend invites you out to lunch at a buffet but you’re trying to eat healthily. Are you better off going for a bowl of oatmeal, some meatballs or just sticking with Prosecco? The answer is, it depends. After all, most foods and beverages aren’t simply good or bad. Everyone is different and, to determine which foods are good for you, you need to consider your age, heritage and how much of any given thing you’ll eat. Just take alcohol. If you drink too much, you’ll damage your brain and gut. However, studies have found that moderate consumption of alcohol in people over the age of forty helps to fight coronary heart disease. That being said, lots of people of Asian descent need to be cautious when drinking. That’s because they’re genetically predisposed to produce lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme your body needs to break down alcohol in your stomach. As a result, more alcohol enters the bloodstream of Asian people per drink than enters the bloodstream of their Caucasian peers, causing them to become more intoxicated. Similarly, as you learned in a previous blink, girls who eat lots of meat reach sexual maturity more quickly and are therefore at increased risk of certain cancers. However, for elderly women, early onset puberty is obviously a non-issue and eating more meat will likely increase their strength. So dietary needs vary dramatically from person to person, but that doesn’t mean food should be a private affair. Eating today can be a lonely activity. But remember that our ancestors used to hunt together and share their food communally. This served to strengthen community bonds and ensured that everyone got a fair share. To reap these benefits, we should make meals more communal. Doing so can be as easy as sharing more meals with friends or endorsing pay-what-you-can restaurants. By taking such actions, we can once again make eating an area of life in which people care for one another. The key message in this book: The human diet has evolved dramatically over the past few million years. By following this evolutionary trail, we can understand the factors that shape our modern diets. While there’s no general dietary prescription that applies to all people, there are some guidelines that might improve both health and happiness. Actionable advice: Sell your car to save your health. Everyone knows that an active lifestyle is a healthy lifestyle. But as long as we have the choice, we tend to stick with what’s comfortable. So consider selling your car and forcing yourself to use modes of transportation that require some exercise. If you’re not sure it’s a good move for your health, just consider the residents of certain mountainous islands, on which it was impractical to build roads. Since they never had roads, traveling by car was never an option. These islanders get around on foot and by bike and, in the end, they live longer, healthier lives than their mainland peers.

    "title": "A Really Good Day",
    "author": "Ayelet Waldman",
    "summary": "Lots of people struggle with their moods. Many, like Ayelet Waldman, struggle enough to seek professional help. But after years of trying – and often failing – to find solutions to her irritability, anger, frustration and depression, Waldman turned to an unexpected source: the psychedelic drug, LSD. Placing two drops on her tongue, Waldman launched herself into an experiment to understand whether taking careful and tiny doses of the drug over just 30 days could help her toward a calmer, more accepting approach to life. In doing so, she also began an exploration into the misunderstood substance, its history and its potential benefits. Drawing on her former legal career – in which she saw firsthand the impact of the United States’ war on drugs – she reflects on the double standards and absurdities of a nation addicted to prescription drugs but willing to incarcerate millions for possessing a substance with a great safety record. Ultimately, Waldman was in search of the secret to having a really good day. Read these blinks, and you’ll discover whether she found it. In these blinks, you’ll discover how microdosing LSD works; why Steve Jobs and Nobel Prize Winners have attributed success to taking LSD; and how psychedelics like LSD can reduce anxiety and generate feelings of happiness, with fewer side effects than many prescription drugs. Ayelet Waldman had been at the mercy of her moods for decades. On a good day, she could be sparkling company – cheerful, friendly, affectionate and productive. But on a bad day, Waldman was worn down by self-hatred, guilt and shame. She’d start arguments with her husband, feel overwhelmed by pessimism and had little sense of self-worth, despite being a successful, published author. Her erratic moods have always made her life, and the lives of her friends and family, more difficult. Seeking help, she turned to therapy, spending many hours sitting on the leather couches of professionals – from Freudians to cognitive behavioral experts, social workers to family therapists. She tried mindfulness – spending long periods meditating and even longer telling her therapist how much she hated meditating. One day, crossing a bridge while driving home, she found herself considering steering to the right and hurtling into the water below. Shocked at this suicidal thought, she sought medical help. Diagnosed with a form of depression – bipolar II disorder – she started taking drugs. For years, Waldman tried numerous medications: Celexa, Prozac, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Effexor, Lamictal, Adderall, Ritalin and many more. Some helped a little, for days or even months at a time. But they had unfortunate side effects, such as weight gain, irritability and a decreased interest in sex. Eventually, she discovered her diagnosis hadn’t even been correct. She realized her moods were fluctuating in direct correlation to her menstrual cycle, and that she had a type of premenstrual syndrome – called premenstrual dysphoric disorder – that caused mood swings at certain points in her cycle. This discovery allowed her to learn the cycle and timing of her moods and take medication only when necessary. But when Waldman entered the perimenopause, her period became irregular, and so did her mood. Things took a turn for the worse, and she became exhausted with fury, irritation and despair. It was at this point that she happened upon the work of James Fadiman, a psychologist and former psychedelic researcher. Fadiman was popularizing the microdosing of LSD – people taking tiny doses of LSD to treat mood problems were reporting that they’d enjoyed a really good day. And a really good day was all the author had ever wanted. Microdosing is such a new concept that Waldman had to teach her computer’s spell-checker to recognize it. The principle of microdosing is simple: The patient takes a tiny dose of LSD on repeating three-day cycles. On day one, you take your dose and monitor your mood, physical sensations, productivity and general experience of how the day went. On days two and three, you take no LSD but continue to monitor. On day four, you take your microdose and repeat the process. The dose in question is, at most, one-tenth a “normal” dose of LSD. Your typical LSD user in search of a trip – hallucinations and an altered consciousness – might take around 100-150 micrograms. The author, like other microdosers, would take just ten micrograms at a time – two tiny drops. The theory of microdosing is that the ten micrograms should be enough to deliver an improvement in mood but without any possibility of hallucinations or other noticeable physical or mental effects. Having learned of microdosing, Waldman was curious, but she was cautious about whether or not to proceed. She had some knowledge of drug issues and their use, having been involved in drug reform issues as a lawyer, but had never taken LSD. As a yoga-pants wearing, Instagramming, Starbucks-drinking, all-around law-abiding mother of four, the idea of becoming, in Fadiman’s words, a “self-study psychedelic researcher” felt ridiculous. But she was suffering from her moods. Even worse, her family were suffering too. So she decided to microdose for a month. Wary of buying drugs herself, she tracked down a microdoser who was able to give her some of his supply. She tested it, to be safe, using a drug testing kit purchased on Amazon. She took her first dose, and had a really good day. On her first day of microdosing, Waldman felt a little different, as if her senses had been heightened. She was more aware than usual of the scent of jasmine in the air and how beautiful the trees in the garden looked. She realized that she felt mindful – able to notice her thoughts and the feelings of her body. Thinking of her family prompted no annoyance, only a sense of love. She had a far more productive day than usual, and for the first time in a long while, felt happy. On her second day, a transition day when she took no LSD, she felt a little more like her usual self again, but still had the sense that it was easier than usual to ignore her bad mood. Day three in the cycle acts as a control day – giving her the experience of a “normal” day so as to allow better judgments about the impact of the dose. She felt her usual, irritable mood return and missed the peace and productivity of the previous two days. As Waldman’s experiment progressed, she found significant benefits to microdosing. On day four, she realized that she had more control over her impulses and irritability. Her kids messed around over breakfast and ended up late for school, but instead of yelling, Waldman felt unusually unphased. Her dog jumped up and caused her to spill tea over a book, but as the dog sat looking sheepish, expecting a scolding, Waldman just gave it a stroke. Happy at her improved mood, Waldman began looking into what LSD and other psychedelics actually do to you. They increase the interaction between serotonin, glutamate, and other factors in the brain, leading to the development of new neural connections and networks. This can help people develop new perspectives on things, such as their own problems. Researchers at UCLA and NYU have recently been able to show that psychedelic treatment can help reduce anxiety and improve the mood of patients facing death. This seemed to fit with Waldman’s experience. After a week, she was feeling different – more capable of dealing with anxiety and irritation, more productive and, well, happier. Her early conclusion was clear: either the microdosing was working, or she was experiencing one hell of a placebo effect. LSD was first synthesized by a Swiss research chemist named Dr. Albert Hofmann in 1938. He consumed the drug throughout his entire life and lived to be 102 years old. Hofman’s longevity might surprise the many people who believe that LSD is a dangerous drug. The truth is, despite its bad reputation, LSD is extremely safe. The author had heard rumors about LSD – that users experienced flashbacks for the rest of their lives, that people threw themselves off buildings thinking they could fly and that there were links between LSD use and psychotic episodes. But there’s plenty of evidence for LSD’s safety: According to a thorough 2008 review in the respected journal CNS: Neuroscience and Therapeutics, there’ve been no documented deaths from LSD overdoses. Other studies show that taking as much as 200 times the dose Waldman was taking would cause no noticeable biological effects – although probably one hell of a trip. Even the worst incidents of LSD overdoses are somewhat reassuring. In 1972, eight people were admitted to the hospital in San Francisco after accidentally snorting vast quantities of LSD, believing it to be cocaine. Five of the eight slipped into comas, while the others vomited continually. Within twelve hours, however, all eight had not just survived, but completely recovered. There are, however, some signs of adverse psychological reactions to LSD use. Very small numbers of people, most of whom had existing psychiatric illnesses, have experienced psychosis or other adverse effects. But the stories Waldman had heard – about people jumping off roofs, or committing suicide? They were merely urban legends. In fact, a recent study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that lifetime psychedelic use actually correlated to a 36 percent reduction in suicide attempts. LSD is unfairly maligned, perhaps, because in the 1960s the drug came to be linked to the youthful counterculture and associated social upheaval of the decade. Young adults protested the Vietnam war, supported the civil rights struggle, smoked pot and dropped LSD. The drug has had a bad reputation ever since. But the overwhelming evidence is that LSD use – even at levels far higher than the microdosing Waldman was administering – is safe. Furthermore, lots of evidence suggests it has positive effects. Let’s take a look. If you’re reading this on an iPhone, iPad or MacBook, you might just have LSD to thank. Steve Jobs, the legendary co-founder of Apple, took LSD and said that it was one of the most important things he ever did. While microdosing, Waldman experienced far greater flow – the experience of being immersed in, and fully concentrating on, her work. And Waldman and Steve Jobs are not the only ones to credit LSD for helping with their work. Kary Mullis was co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, in recognition of his work on the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which enabled gene cloning, DNA sequencing and other breakthroughs. Mullis said that taking LSD was a mind-opening experience, one that was more important than any of the courses he took. He doubted whether he would have invented PCR were it not for LSD. These anecdotes are backed up by research. One recent study – using MRI machines to follow the brain’s reaction to LSD – found that the drug generates a sort of hyper-connectivity, as ordinarily unrelated regions of the brain communicate with each other. That, it appears, enables new ideas and breakthroughs to emerge. Earlier in his career, James Fadiman ran an experiment to explore whether psychedelics could inspire creativity. He recruited senior research scientists from innovative businesses, including a few who would go on to design silicon chips and invent the computer mouse. All of them had thorny problems they were struggling to solve. They were each given a 100-microgram dose of LSD, while Fadiman observed, guided and conducted psychometric tests. The results were incredible: While the participants’ performance on psychometric tests improved, more compellingly, they reported experiencing sparks of intellectual intuition that solved many of their problems. Fadiman claims that a number of patents and products emerged from the session. Not long afterward, the authorities changed their minds about letting Fadiman research psychedelics. LSD’s bad reputation had struck again. But even today, many high-powered professionals in numerous fields are using LSD. Its popularity in Silicon Valley has surged, as startup employees and tech bros try to stimulate their neural connections. Of course, its use remains completely illegal. What’s the worst possible side-effect of microdosing LSD? The risk of getting arrested. Although Waldman only ever had a tiny quantity of LSD in her possession, it was still enough to face a sentence of up to three years from a state court. If you consider who the majority of prisoners guilty of drug offenses are, you’re probably thinking of a dealer caught in possession of a few weeks supply. The reality is that simple drug possession in the United States is prosecuted with great vigor, and prisons are full of people caught with modest quantities of drugs like LSD or marijuana. Over 40 percent of drug possession arrests are for the possession of a drug that 19.8 million Americans have used in the last four weeks. Half of all federal prisoners are doing time for drug offenses, and the majority are low-level offenders. Waldman herself was at relatively little risk of prosecution – indeed, she felt able to write about her experience. Why? Because she is white and wealthy. America’s war on drugs has always had a racial and class element. The very first antidrug laws – created to outlaw opium in the 1870s – were focused on poor Chinese immigrants, while society ignored the large numbers of white, middle-class people addicted to laudanum. Early twentieth-century antidrug campaigns talked of supposedly drugged black people attacking white women, while warnings of the “Marijuana-Crazed Madman” from Mexico weren’t far behind. This racism is still evident today: for every white person convicted of drug offenses, ten African Americans are incarcerated – despite the fact that white people are five times more likely to use drugs than African Americans. The war on drugs has seen prison populations rise, and African Americans suffer racial prejudice – but for what? People are still taking drugs, many of which, like LSD, are mostly harmless. Drug production and trafficking lies beyond the reach of regulation and taxation – funding violence and crime while drugs like heroin and cocaine get cheaper and cheaper. Researcher James Fadiman once believed that Sandoz Pharmaceuticals – the company that originally discovered and synthesized LSD – could’ve released a microdose version of LSD to the marketplace that could compete with the likes of Ritalin and Adderall. Unfortunately, after the drug was made illegal in the 1960s, that became an impossibility. Nonetheless, informal research into microdosing LSD has continued, largely led by Fadiman. Already researching the use of psychedelics, he once came across a woman who told him of her experiences with microdosing. Interested, Fadiman put together a protocol based around the same three-day model that Waldman used and published it in a 2011 book. Since then, Fadiman has received around 300 requests for his protocol, and 50 reports back from people who’ve used it. Just two of those 50 people reported negative reactions to microdosing. One person stopped the protocol halfway through the month as a result of extreme tiredness on the second and third days – the days after a dose was taken. Another simply reported that they stopped due to changes in their life circumstances. It’s possible, even likely, of course, that some of the 250 people who didn’t report back had a negative experience. But the overwhelming picture from those reporting back to Fadiman was positive. Most people reported a mixture of emotional, intellectual, and physical benefits, as well as improvements to their personal relationships. Users reported reduced anxiety, greater acceptance of life and its minor problems, greater creativity and focus and reduced conflict with their friends and families. Others commented on unusual effects: One person reported experiencing less depression in the face of their Parkinson’s disease, although the symptoms had continued. A person with a stutter saw a clear alleviation of symptoms, while a marijuana user – and in another case, a smoker – were both able to kick their habits. Fadiman’s research is, of course, no substitute for a proper clinical study into microdosing. He hopes that someday there will be formal research conducted into microdosing’s effectiveness and safety. There are already two potential projects underway in Australia and Europe, so it’s possible that a microdosing study will become a reality in the near future. At the end of 30 days, and ten tiny doses of LSD, Waldman reflected on her experiences. The only days when she had felt any abnormal sensations – mental or physical – were the days she’d taken a dose. She occasionally felt dizzy or nauseous on the day of a dose, and sometimes felt more likely to become irritable on a microdose day. On the following days, she simply felt happy, optimistic and relaxed – far better than she usually felt before her microdosing experiment. One microdose day, Waldman had a major fight with her husband. Even then, she reported some positive signs. Normally when fighting with her husband, she ends up feeling intense shame – triggering guilt and, in turn, depression. During her microdosing month, and particularly on this occasion, Waldman felt she was more forgiving of herself after the conflict and less quick to fall into shame. Perhaps the best indication of microdosing’s impact came from Waldman’s family: Told that she’d been experimenting with a mood medication, Waldman’s children were unsurprised, having observed clearly improved moods and behavior during the month. Her younger daughter said that even when angry Waldman had seemed much more under control. One of her sons commented that she’d merely been nicer and happier, while another said that she’d dealt with stress without yelling or shouting. Looking back over the thirty days, Waldman came to the conclusion that she’d both felt and behaved differently. For once, she’d been able to look back at the end of the day, and think - that was a good day. Her experiment left her positive and hopeful for the future, but also facing a paradox. She lives in a drug-obsessed nation, where ten percent of the population are taking antidepressants, and she’d finally found a drug that seemed to work. But her drug was completely illegal. Taking a benzodiazepine – an addictive drug that can cause Alzheimer’s – would be completely fine. A doctor would happily prescribe it. But a tiny dosage of a drug with no apparent mental or physical side effects? For now, that remains a crime. The key message in these blinks: Society's attitude to drugs is entirely wrong-headed. Vast numbers of people take large quantities of often addictive and potentially harmful drugs in an attempt to tackle mental health problems, with very limited success. Meanwhile, we incarcerate millions of people for taking drugs that are no more harmful, but just happen to be illegal. With LSD microdosing illegal, despite its apparent benefits and lack of harm, we potentially deny many people the possibility of experiencing more really good days. Got feedback?

    "title": "Always Hungry?",
    "author": "Dr. David Ludwig",
    "summary": "Diets don’t work. True, you may lose a few pounds in the first few weeks – while feeling hungry, cranky and cold – but we all know that those pounds will creep back again. Likewise, it doesn’t help to eat exclusively low-fat foods. In fact, obesity rates have skyrocketed and people have become less healthy since nutrition experts began suggesting that people cut back on dietary fat. So if you’re overweight, what can you do? Well, you don’t have to count calories and feel terrible. You just need to eat correctly. These blinks will set you on the right path. In these blinks, you’ll learn why scarfing down cinnamon buns will actually make you more hungry; how an overstuffed fat cell can mimic a stab wound; and why it’s totally possible to get leaner by eating fatty foods. People have spent decades trying to lose weight by counting calories, eating fat-free foods and exercising. So why is obesity still such a serious problem in the United States? To understand, first we have to look at some of the many misunderstandings surrounding obesity. Contrary to popular belief, weight gain isn’t caused by a lack of physical activity. In fact, exercise can even be counterproductive when you’re trying to lose weight. We tend to overestimate the number of calories we burn while playing sports, for instance, and it actually takes a lot of effort to burn the calories contained in a single chocolate bar. The bottom line is that you can’t lose weight by spending more time at the gym – and strenuous exercise might make you hungrier or even encourage you to overeat. “Fat genes” don’t explain our society’s weight problems, either (although they can have some impact on an individual’s body weight). The obesity epidemic is a fairly recent phenomenon, starting in the United States in the 1970s, and then spreading to Europe and Japan. Any genetic changes we might’ve experienced can’t have been expressed that rapidly. Something else has to be going on. But obesity is also not simply the result of consuming more calories than we burn. People who believe that think we can fix the problem just by eating less. But that doesn’t work. Why? Because, first of all, it’s not that easy just to eat less! Secondly, it’s unhealthy to prioritize certain foods based on their calorie content. A 200-calorie serving of french fries is much more unhealthy, for example, than a 200-calorie serving of nuts. But most importantly, and perhaps the most harmful misconception about weight loss, is that you can’t lose weight by eating less. You don’t gain weight when your cells have too many calories. You gain weight when your organs aren’t getting enough nutrients from your blood. If your organs are low on nutrients, a calorie-restricted diet only makes the problem worse. It slows your metabolism and increases your appetite – so a simple weight-loss plan won’t get you very far. Most people assume that consuming fat is “fattening.” If that were the case, you could lose weight just by replacing your favorite foods with low-fat alternatives. Such a diet would probably make you gain weight, however, because of the effects of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that determines how your body processes calories, and it’s generated by your pancreas. Insulin levels rise when you eat food, causing your body’s tissues to absorb the nutrients in your bloodstream: glucose from carbohydrates, amino acids from proteins and fatty acids from fat. Insulin levels decrease a few hours after you’ve finished eating, allowing some of the nutrients stored in your fat cells to re-enter your bloodstream, giving energy to your brain and other organs. Consuming too many refined carbohydrates, such as sugar and processed starch, causes your body to produce a lot of insulin and this, ultimately, leads to weight gain. So why do we crave high-carbohydrate foods such as pasta, candy bars or cinnamon buns? These refined, or processed, carbohydrates give us an immediate boost of energy. The body in essence is flooded with glucose, which causes insulin levels in your blood to spike. In turn, fat cells work to absorb excess amounts of glucose and fatty acids to remove all that sugar in your blood. Yet here’s the catch. When your body runs out of fuel after a spike like this, your brain gets nervous and makes you think you’re hungry again, so you’ll eat more. And if you don’t eat more, your brain thinks that the body’s low blood-sugar levels are a sign of starvation, triggering your metabolism to slow and conserve the calories you do have. You’ll feel cold and weak, and gain more weight. A lot of the “low-fat” food we eat in hopes of losing weight are in fact high in carbohydrates, which as you now know, actually facilitate weight gain! When you cut yourself, your body’s immune system immediately goes into action. The wounded tissue sends a chemical signal, alerting white blood cells to kill any harmful bacteria. The body’s immune response subsides once the tissue begins to heal. Yet if you are obese, your immune response doesn’t function properly. The fat cells of obese people are constantly stressed, which keeps your immune system in perpetual attack mode. This loop triggers chronic inflammation in your body. Here’s how this happens. When you gain weight, your fat cells get “fatter,” too. A fat cell dies from oxygen deprivation when it reaches a critical size, which then triggers your immune system to attack the cell and fix the damage. This response is life-saving if you’ve cut yourself, but when you’re fat, your immune system isn’t attacking foreign bacteria but instead your own body! Chronic inflammation can cause a number of health problems, such as increasing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs when fat cells become desensitized to the body’s signals to store calories for later use, so excess sugar and fat remain in your blood. When your blood is swamped with excess sugar, your body moves them to other places such as your liver. This isn’t a good idea, as this can make your liver function improperly. And when blood sugar levels are high, your pancreas secretes even more insulin, which can overstimulate cell growth. Your molecular control system may be unable to stem that growth, which can increase your chances of developing cancer. Eventually your pancreas becomes worn out by all this extra work, and starts to produce too little insulin. This is how people develop type 2 diabetes. Chronic inflammation can’t be cured with drugs, either. Taking medicine can only lessen the symptoms of inflammation. All in all, obesity throws your entire immune system off balance. If you want to lose weight, forget about low-fat or low-calorie diets, as they’re just unhealthy. Follow these tips instead. The first thing you need to do is make sure your body gets the correct nutrients. Nutrients are essential! If you don’t eat enough of them, your body keeps telling you to eat until you do. So if you’re consuming unhealthy foods, you’ll take in more calories than you need and gain weight. Aim to take in a high amount of nutrients from smaller portions, instead. Crucially, be sure to get a few ounces of protein everyday. You also need a fraction of an ounce of healthy fat: monounsaturated fats such as those found in olive oil and nuts, polyunsaturated fats found in fatty fish or saturated fats found in coconut oil. Be sure to eat your vegetables, too! Vegetables are a powerful source of protein and calcium. They help you shed pounds and improve the composition of your gut bacteria. Plant fiber is good for maintaining healthy bacteria in your colon, and chemicals in plants called polyphenols lessen the effects of harmful microbes. People with a wide variety of healthy bacteria are often slimmer and have fewer problems with chronic inflammation. Importantly, your body doesn’t need a lot of carbohydrates, so eat them sparingly. We’ve seen how processed carbohydrates can disrupt your immune system and cause you to gain weight. Fructose, another carbohydrate, causes other problems. Unlike ordinary sugars, fructose can only be metabolized in the liver. Thus, excessive amounts of fructose overwhelm the liver, causing it to store too much fat, which impedes its function and can cause permanent damage. So how do you develop the self-discipline to stick to your new, healthier lifestyle? The first thing you need to do is learn to trust your body. Let it guide you and tell you when to eat. Don’t set a calorie limit for yourself. You body knows what you need better than any prescribed diet plan. So trust your body and listen to its hunger cues. You don’t need to constantly measure your progress, either. Don’t obsess daily about recording your body’s measurements or weight, as that only causes stress. Weigh yourself instead once every other week. Accept that you’ll face tough moments, too. Tough moments occur when you feel tempted to fall back into unhealthy habits. You might crave a candy bar after a difficult day at work, for instance. Prepare yourself for these moments by identifying the reasons you want a healthier lifestyle. You can even write these reasons down and post them where you’ll see them anytime you feel tempted. You can also make some if-then plans. Plan ahead for those nights when you get home late and don’t have the energy to cook. Buy pre-cut vegetables, for example, so the time between hunger and sitting down to a healthy meal at home is short. Another thing that’s crucial for staying motivated is having an organized, well-stocked kitchen. It’s much more fun to prepare healthy meals when you have on hand all the ingredients you need. So throw out all those bad, tempting foods. Get rid of high-carbohydrate baked goods, those bags of candy, white rice and nonfat dairy products. Stock your kitchen instead with frozen tropical fruit, sweeteners like maple syrup, whole milk products, nuts, seeds and dark chocolate. That’s the stuff you want around when you’re craving a snack. Your new, healthier lifestyle starts with lowering your body’s insulin levels. For two weeks, cut out any foods that might trigger cravings, those items that cause your body to produce too much insulin. These things typically include grain-based products, potatoes and processed foods with added sugar. Instead, choose to eat real food, such as starchy vegetables and legumes. Choose healthy fats, like olive oil, nuts and avocados; and high-protein foods like fish, eggs and cheese. These foods when eaten in moderation should satisfy most of your body’s nutritional needs. In general, you need to aim for a diet that contains 50 percent fats, 25 percent carbohydrates and 25 percent protein. For breakfast, consider this delicious menu: two eggs with one extra egg white, fried with a teaspoon of olive oil. Top the egg with a spicy chili sauce and two tablespoons of shredded cheddar cheese. On the side, enjoy a half-cup of Greek yogurt with fresh or frozen raspberries. And don’t buy just any sauce with added sugar off the shelf, make your own! To make a “ranchero” sauce, chop one yellow bell pepper, one green pepper, a clove of garlic and one small onion in a food processor. Cook this mixture for 10 to 15 minutes over a low flame in olive oil, adding dried oregano, a chopped spicy red chili, one chopped tomato and salt and pepper to taste. Eating well is also about taking it easy. This program shouldn’t stress you out or make you feel food-deprived. Eat an amount of food that feels right for you! Importantly, stop if you feel satisfied before you finish your meal. If you’re still hungry after you finish, however, have more. Don’t be afraid to snack in between meals, either. Consider a healthy snack of hummus with veggie sticks, or pumpkin seeds tossed with olive oil, chili powder and salt and baked for ten minutes. You still need to exercise, however, even though you’re taking it easy. In the beginning, a daily walk is enough. If you already go to the gym regularly, reduce your workout intensity by a third. And finally, don’t forget to drink plenty of water! The second stage of your new, healthier lifestyle will last longer than the first. It could last a month, six months or even more, depending on your weight and how well your body responds to your diet. Habituate your cells to healthy carbs by gradually introducing carbohydrates back into your diet and seeing how your body responds. Your cells at this point should be a bit more responsive to insulin after your diet’s first phase, so train them further by reintroducing unprocessed carbs, which will increase your body’s blood sugar levels a bit. The ratio of nutrients you should be aiming for at this stage is 40 percent fats, 25 percent protein and 35 percent carbohydrate. Try eating whole grains, starchy vegetables (no potatoes!), tropical fruit or honey. You can have a half-cup of brown rice, oats or quinoa three times a week, but not more than once per meal. A half-cup of cooked corn, yams or sweet potatoes is also a healthy addition. Try to avoid eating grains and starchy vegetables at the same meal, however. If your cravings increase during this time, your body’s insulin levels might be to blame. Get them back in check again by reducing your intake of grains and carbohydrates, and eating more fats and proteins. Don’t be hard on yourself! If you slip up and overeat one day, it’s okay – just don’t give up. Accept this setback as another part of your journey. If you make yourself feel bad about mistakes, you’ll fall further off track. These moments are opportunities to learn more about yourself and your body. Exercise is a good way to strengthen your body and burn any excess carbs. It also increases your insulin sensitivity. So in addition to your daily walk, do an extra half-hour of moderate physical activity, such as practicing yoga, taking a light hike or an easy jog. Congratulations, you’re at the last stage! During this final stage, you’ll be able to mindfully choose healthy foods for yourself and apply the lessons you’ve learned to your daily life. This means you can slowly reintroduce some processed carbohydrates and sweets into your diet. Pay careful attention to how your body reacts, however. Reintroduce one food item at a time, and don’t eat more than two modest portions of carbohydrates a day. You can enjoy some bread with your morning omelet, for instance. Or a light pasta dish for dinner. If your body doesn’t feel right afterward, you can always go back to phase two – or even phase one – to get your body back on track. Your aim at this point should be to consume a diet of 40 percent fats, 40 percent carbohydrates and 20 percent protein. Make sure these reintroduced carbohydrates don’t replace protein or healthy fat in your diet. Take care to eat enough foods with high-quality fats, such as nuts, nut butters, avocados and olive oil. It’s also important to eat mindfully, keeping your stress levels in check. Mindfulness is an important part of staying in control of your cravings. Your cells will become more sensitive to insulin again once you cut out processed carbohydrates from your diet, so you won’t need to eat as many carbs to feel satisfied – as long as you eat mindfully. So never eat in front of the television or computer. Eat slowly and focus on your food. Try to avoid having stressful conversations while eating. Stress can make you overeat! If you are feeling stressed, try doing some light exercise, such as taking a walk. Incorporate outdoor activities into your daily life, whether swimming in the ocean or taking a stroll around a wooded neighborhood block. The key message in this book: You won’t lose weight by cutting calories, starving yourself or following a trendy, low-fat diet. Tune into your body, instead of working against it. Train your cells to process fat more efficiently by recalibrating your diet with nutritious foods and being aware of what your body really needs. Got feedback?

    "title": "An American Sickness",
    "author": "Elisabeth Rosenthal",
    "summary": "Over the last few decades, health care has become a major point of debate in the United States. Politicians of all stripes argue over the price of medicine and different approaches to health insurance, but, though everyone seems to agree that something isn’t working, no one seems to have a clear idea of exactly how to fix it. How did it come to this? In these blinks, we‘ll dive deep into the US health-care system and explore why the United States approaches treatment of the ill very differently than most other Western nations. We’ll look at the history of health care, as well as the current situation and possibilities for the future. There may be a way to save a system that most parties agree is sick. You’ll also find out why prescription drugs are so expensive in the United States; that hospitals make money on tests you might not need; and what you can do to start reducing health-care costs now. In the grand scheme of things, the American health-care industry isn’t very old. It emerged around 1900, with the introduction of the very first health-insurance policies, which were designed to compensate workers for income lost during illness. The earliest US insurance companies were nonprofits that aimed to help hospitals get paid while also helping patients save money. For a long time, Blue Cross and Blue Shield were the only major health-insurance companies. But in the 1950s, a decade during which the number of Americans buying health insurance jumped by 60 percent, it became clear that insurance was big business. Soon, for-profit companies started taking over. Since then, health insurance has remained an extremely profitable business. To understand just how big the industry has become, let’s look at Jeffrey Kivi, a New York chemistry teacher who has been treated for psoriatic arthritis since childhood. People with this condition have an over-responsive immune system that attacks their skin, and, without regular infusions of a drug called Remicade, their life would be almost unbearable. Jeffrey’s treatments used to cost $19,000 every six weeks, and his insurance always covered it. But then, when Kivi’s doctor moved to another hospital, a single infusion suddenly started costing $130,000. Jeffrey was surprised when his insurance company picked up the tab, no questions asked. It might seem crazy, but nowadays, insurance companies are actually looking for such absurdly high bills. In 1993, Blue Cross spent 95 cents of every dollar they earned covering medical costs, but in the following years they decided to keep most of that money as profit. That is, until the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) required insurers to spend at least 80 to 85 percent of every dollar earned on patient care. This requirement is what made Jeffrey’s insurance company so happy to pick up that $130,000 tab. Since they make so much money, they need to spend a lot of it in order to adhere to the rules. But this is only scratching the surface of what’s going on in today’s American health-care system. The origins of many American hospitals, most of which began as charitable institutions set up by religious groups, can be traced back to the nineteenth century. But today, hospitals are more like major corporations than philanthropic foundations. The transition from charity to big business took place in the 1970s, when hospitals began hiring business consultants from firms like Deloitte & Touche, which introduced concepts like “strategic pricing.” From this point on, hospitals were in the business of manipulating their bills and raising prices in an effort to optimize profits. More often than not, patients end up bearing the brunt of these price hikes. In 2014, attorney Heather Pearce Campbell, a patient of the Swedish Medical Center, in Seattle, was pregnant with her second child. A sonogram had revealed an ectopic pregnancy; the embryo was growing in one of her fallopian tubes. Since this is a potentially fatal complication, she was quickly sent to an operating room to have the tube and embryo removed. The relatively simple procedure went fine, but then the hospital bill arrived – for over $44,000. Not only was this an exorbitant fee, but the bill categorized the procedure as “miscellaneous.” It was just another way for the hospital’s accountants to maximize profits. Hospitals also started treating doctors like investment bankers and giving them incentives known as “productivity bonuses.” The more they charged their patients, the higher their paychecks. The business consultants restructured the hospitals as well, so areas that were underperforming, like the dialysis unit, were outsourced to make room for the expansion of more profitable units, such as orthopedic and cardiac. All of these changes resulted in more costs for the patient. Between 1997 and 2012, overall hospital service fees increased by 149 percent. In 2013, an average day in a US hospital cost $4,300, which is ten times more than a stay in a Spanish hospital. Wondering why hospitals charge so much is like wondering why bank robbers rob banks. It’s not that complicated: they do it for the money. In 1990, the American College of Surgeons required its members to make a pledge that included these words: “I will set my fees commensurate with the services rendered.” Unsurprisingly, this statement was removed from the pledge in 2004. While it’s fair to expect doctors to be reasonably compensated, given their years of intensive education and training, the definition of “reasonable” has recently been stretched to a patently unreasonable degree. Today, America’s wealthiest one percent includes around 27 percent of the nation’s doctors. Part of this wealth comes from the new revenue streams doctors have access to, which has turned the profession into a cross between doctor and entrepreneur. Take ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), for example. Made popular during the eighties and nineties, these facilities are being run less by hospitals and more by individual doctors and investors. In theory, a stay at an ASC should be cheaper since they don’t have to deal with the huge overhead costs of a standard hospital. But doctors have struck gold by charging a “facility fee” for their high-end suites, and with fees of between $5,000 and $10,000 per night, it’s not unlike being charged for a room rate at an exclusive hotel. Some doctors have found their fortune by using the private-practice business model. Many of these are specialists, such as anesthesiologists and radiologists – people who aren’t commonly needed yet nonetheless serve very important functions. They are referred to as NPCs, or no patient contact specialists, and during the 1980s most of them were employed by hospitals. But now they’ve started opening private practices and they work with hospitals through contracts. These contracts are often expensive, which is why a visit with an NPC can be the biggest fee on a hospital bill. These are just a couple of the methods doctors use to generate revenue. The medical field is a huge business and there are very few doctors who haven’t found a way to commercialize their practice. Like hospitals, many of the big US pharmaceutical companies can be traced back to the nineteenth century. Back then, they were small businesses selling tonics and potions that succeeded in mixing a little bit of science with a whole lot of fanciful marketing. Though this formula for success sounds quaint, the sad truth is that it hasn’t changed all that much. Prices, however, have. Vaccines used to be sold for pennies, and antibiotics went for a few dollars. But these days, drug prices are routinely raised as high as the market can bear, and there’s little patients can do about it. For example, a monthly dose for the ulcer-treatment drug Mesalamine goes for around $12 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, patients pay between $700 and $1,200 for the same amount. Even patients whose lives depend on this medication have no choice but to pay full price. In 2015, former hedge-fund manager Martin Shkreli bought the rights to Daraprim, a medication used in the treatment of HIV. He made headlines and became the poster boy for big-pharma greed when he raised the price of one pill from $13.50 to $750. It’s reasonable to think there should be laws against such actions, but pharmaceutical companies excel at finding various strategies to manipulate patent law. In order to continue raising prices and profits, new patents need to be secured. And so companies create “new” drugs made of existing, non-patented ingredients and thereby secure a new patent. It’s become an easy and standard process. Mesalamine is an example of a drug that uses non-patented ingredients, and to keep the patent from expiring, the pharmaceutical companies only need to show that they made a “non-obvious” modification to it. Another popular strategy is to earn a new patent by combining old drugs to create a new drug. This is how Horizon pharmaceuticals created the painkiller Duexis, back in 2011, which is a combination of ibuprofen, the anti-inflammatory, and famotidine, which coats and protects the stomach lining. By combining these two old ingredients, Horizon only had to spend $9 to produce Duexis, but they can now charge over $1,600 for it. In 2006, Robin Miller’s brother had a heart attack and during his recovery he required an implantable defibrillator, which is similar to a pacemaker. Robin’s brother was uninsured, so Robin agreed to cover the costs. But neither the hospital nor the manufacturer would tell him exactly what these costs would amount to. This particular case is representative of a general problem. Much of what goes on in the area of medical devices is hidden from customers, and yet these devices are often the single most expensive part of a medical bill. One of the primary reasons costs are so high is that only a few companies control the entire medical device market, making them a tight-knit oligopoly with very little competition. Knee and hip implants, for example, are made by either Stryker, Zimmer Biomet, DePuy Synthes or Smith & Nephew, and that’s about it. Experts in the field like to refer to this small group as “the cartel.” The result of this limited competition is that many medical devices come with an unreasonably expensive price tag. In fact, there aren’t any wholesale prices at all: the exorbitant costs of devices are determined after various intermediaries negotiate their cut. So the usual breakdown is that 16 to 18 percent will go to sales representatives, distributors get 30 percent and then hospitals add an additional 100 to 300 percent for their cut. In Robin Miller’s case, he ended up paying $30,000 for his brother’s defibrillator. What’s worse is that the lack of oversight in this market has resulted in medical devices receiving very little safety review. Remarkably, there is next to no regulatory approval or clinical tests required, certainly not the kind given to pharmaceuticals, despite the fact that many of these devices are designed to be implanted. This lack of scrutiny has led to a number of medical disasters. When a new surgical clip was manufactured and put to use, it was found to be faulty after it failed to close off a big blood vessel. The patient bled out during an operation that, normally, is simple and safe. If you’ve ever worked in the service industry, you may know that restaurants make most of their profit by selling expensive cocktails and drinks. As it turns out, hospitals have their own version of this. But instead of booze, they make the real money from testing and ancillary services, such as physical therapy sessions. For example, patients recovering from a hip replacement are often prescribed a long period of physical therapy that ends up costing a small fortune. Sometimes a patient won’t be discharged until undergoing PT, even though research suggests it’s not necessary after hip replacements. Thorough testing is generally a good thing when getting a proper diagnosis, but it’s also a growing revenue stream for hospitals that are all too willing to prescribe an unnecessary test. This is why physician assistants and nurses are allowed to order tests before a doctor even takes a first look at a patient. Björn Kemper’s son was complaining of a stomachache, so Björn took him to the emergency room at Florida Celebration Health Hospital. Next thing he knew, a completely unnecessary $7,000 CAT scan was underway. Prices are also being driven up by the rise of medical conglomerates. When a hospital suddenly begins issuing outrageous medical bills, it’s often a sign that they’ve joined one of the big conglomerates, which act like health-care monopolies designed to drive competition out of the area. Conglomerates can raise prices as they see fit, and research shows that towns and cities with them tend to see an increase in health-care costs of between 40 to 50 percent. One of California’s hospital conglomerates is called Sutter Health, and it’s comprised of 24 hospitals, 34 outpatient surgicenters, nine cancer centers and thousands of affiliated private practices. In some areas of California, a patient has no alternative but to deal with the overpriced service of a Sutter Health facility. In a 2014 study of US customer debt, 52 percent of the overdue debt on current credit reports was the result of unpaid medical bills. In fact, one out of every five Americans had medical debt that was affecting their credit score, and therefore their chances of buying a car or getting a loan or a mortgage. While we’ve looked at many of the reasons for massive medical bills, it all boils down to this: health care today is being run like big business. This change is reflected by the language being used. There was once a time when doctors and nurses – and even insurers – were concerned about “patients,” whereas today they deal with “consumers.” And rather than “illnesses,” some medical consultants speak of “high-value disease states.” The business side of medicine is also apparent in today’s lack of research funding. At the Harvard Medical School, Dr. Denise Faustman was researching treatment for type 1 diabetes, but no one, not even the major foundations dedicated to diabetes research, wanted to pay for her work. The reason for this? Her possible cure had no potential for commercial profit. The business of health care would rather sell treatment over an entire lifetime than sell a single cure. Fortunately, Dr. Faustman was able to find public funding online to continue her important research. One of the goals of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was to shift health care away from being profit-driven and back toward being patient-oriented. Parts of ACA are truly revolutionary in this regard, such as making it illegal to deny patients coverage due to a preexisting illness. Thanks to the ACA, the percentage of uninsured Americans dropped from 18 percent to 11.9 percent, between 2013 and 2016. But there are still improvements to be made, as Obamacare did little to reduce costs. You’ve probably heard about the refugee crisis, but have you heard of “health-care refugees”? This is the growing number of middle- to upper-middle-class Americans who are moving to other countries in an effort to avoid unbearable medical costs. The author once met a graduate student with diabetes who was searching for an academic position abroad because she could no longer afford treatment in the United States. If the United States hopes to reduce the number of fleeing citizens, it needs to make health care more affordable, which it could do by following the lead of other nations with good and affordable health care. Setting a national fee schedule for certain drugs, procedures and devices is one way the United States could generate reasonable costs. This is how countries like Germany, Japan and Belgium operate. The prices are negotiated by doctors, academics and government personnel, and once they’re set they can’t be suddenly raised overnight. America could also introduce a single-payer system, similar to the ones in places like Canada, Australia and Taiwan. In this system, the government covers most of the money being paid to health-care providers, thereby cutting out the private insurers from most of the basic services. Private insurers would only factor into “extra” treatments, like cosmetic dentistry or laser eye surgery. This kind of system has been debated over the years, and its opponents have kept it from moving forward by calling it “socialized medicine,” which tends to be a damning term in US politics. But there are things you as a patient can do to keep costs down, and the first step is to speak up and ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask how much a treatment will cost. Ask about cheaper alternatives and why tests are being done. Is that blood test, X-ray or CAT scan really necessary? It’s also wise to clarify where a scheduled procedure will take place, and how the location might affect the cost. And when you’re getting a referral to another doctor, make sure they’re part of your insurer’s network. If they aren’t, then ask for one who is. While some doctors are more focused on profits than patient care, most of them are in the profession because they care. A lot of doctors are on your side and just as angry as you about the state of the health-care system. Before trying a new restaurant these days, people tend to check online reviews. This is something you can – and should – do before picking a hospital as well. Many hospitals in the United States are reviewed on Yelp, and the customer reviews to be found there can give you a good idea of what to expect. U.S. News & World Report publishes a ranking of the country’s best hospitals that takes into account their reputation within the medical community. This valuable resource also considers the ratio between nurses and patients and the number of medical mishaps. And then you can always check Medicare’s online Hospital Compare program, too. Once you’ve arrived at a hospital, there are more steps you can take to keep costs down. First, when you’re being admitted and asked to sign documents, keep an eye out for the one that’s asking you to agree to pay costs not covered by your insurer. You can check the “limited consent” clause, which says you’re agreeing to those costs “as long as the providers are in my insurance network.” Second, if your bill is unreasonably high, don’t be afraid to negotiate. With prices as inflated as they are, hospitals even allow low-level clerks to approve major discounts. So make an offer or simply let them know if you can’t pay. Hospitals don’t benefit when they have to send overdue bills to debt collectors, so they’ll be willing to negotiate. Third, always ask for a complete itemization of your bill for transparency. Also, choose your health insurance carefully. It can be an overwhelming task, but carefully consider all your options and read the small print. You can also take advantage of the health-care “navigators” that the Affordable Care Act introduced. If you want to stick with your current doctor, call the office and ask for a list of the insurance plans that he or she accepts. In a 2015 poll, 72 percent of Americans said they felt the cost of prescription drugs was unreasonably high and approximately 25 percent reported difficulties in paying for their medication. Unfortunately, this problem is even worse for people with poor health. If you hope to lower your drug expenses, here are a few tips. First, ask your doctor if there are any cheaper alternatives to your prescribed medications. Oftentimes, there are less expensive, but no less effective, alternatives to brand-name prescription drugs. Sometimes a change in dosage can save money as well, so find out if it’s cheaper to take two five-milligram pills instead of one ten-milligram pill. Second, shop around at different drug stores and online outlets. GoodRx.com, for example, allows you to compare the prices at every pharmacy in your local area. It also provides coupons! Third, if you really can’t afford a drug, you might want to consider buying it outside the United States. You might be thinking, “Isn’t importing drugs for personal use illegal in the United States?” Indeed it is, but it’s also true that intercepting small packages of prescription drugs is practically impossible, and the government has largely turned a blind eye to this practice as long as the amount is for three months or less. Websites such as PharmacyChecker.com can help you verify whether a foreign pharmacy is trustworthy. Finally, there are ways you can reduce expenses on costly medical services. Whenever possible, decline tests or services that aren’t offered by your insurance network, and always double-check to make sure that a service really is part of your network. Another general rule is to avoid having blood and other fluid specimens tested in hospital labs. These in-house services tend to be far pricier than commercial labs. So ask your doctor to send them to one of the commercial labs that are in your insurance network. Big business has seized control of the US health-care system, but you still have a voice. Don’t be afraid to speak up and demand reasonable care at an affordable cost. The key message in this book: The American health-care system is a mess. Patients are routinely forced to pay exorbitant fees on everything from hospital visits and services to medications and devices. But there is still hope. There are many ways you can protect yourself from unnecessary costs, like choosing health insurance wisely, negotiating with hospitals and making sure you know exactly what you’re paying for. Actionable advice: Consider a nonprofit insurance plan. Only a handful of nonprofit insurance plans exist, but it could be just the right thing for you. The real benefit of nonprofit insurers is that they have no shareholders, so none of your hard-earned money will line the pockets of its investors. The primary concern of a nonprofit health-insurance plan is patient care. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "An Elegant Defense",
    "author": "Matt Richtel",
    "summary": "The author, Matt Richtel, put pen to paper when he witnessed a miracle.  His dear friend Jason Greenstein, who’d been on the verge of succumbing to cancer, was cured. Thanks to a new drug that harnesses the powers of the immune system, he was able to beat the unbeatable. That’s when Richtel decided to write An Elegant Defense. The seemingly miraculous recovery of his friend had ignited his imagination. If we could tinker with the human immune system and tap into its awesome power – and with such amazing results! – then what disease couldn’t we conquer? In his book, Richtel went on to lay out the history of immunology – the branch of medicine dedicated to the immune system. And he told that history in an unconventional way, weaving it together with the personal stories of four people whose health conditions dovetail with advances in the field.  In these blinks, we’ll follow Richtel’s lead and take a whirlwind tour of that history, and then we’ll focus on one of those stories – Jason’s, which has an important lesson to teach us about both the progress and the limits of our ability to direct and command our elegant defense. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: the difference between a neutrophil and a dendritic cell; which animals led to the discovery of the immune system; and why it’s dangerous when the immune system overreacts. Imagine a huge party – a massive, rip-roaring carnival with hundreds of billions of attendees. Where is this wild, gargantuan bash with a guest list well over a hundred times larger than Earth’s human population? It’s inside you. The merrymakers are your own cells, as well as billions of bacteria and viruses. This party is what the author calls the Festival of Life. At this festival, making sure everything runs smoothly, are janitors and handymen, security personnel and emergency responders – the cells that constitute your immune system. They are your body’s elegant defense. They attend to tissue damage and clean up toxins. And they fight off malicious intruders known as pathogens. Pathogens are disease-causing agents, and they come in three main forms: bacteria, viruses and parasites. For the purposes of these blinks, we’ll be focusing only on the first two. In their most dangerous forms, you can think of them as tiny little killers. They’re small – really small. You can fit a few thousand bacteria inside one human cell. Viruses are even smaller. A few thousand would fit inside a single bacterium.  But a quick caveat: though some bacteria and viruses are pathogenic, most aren’t. In fact, a mere one percent of all bacteria are likely to cause illness. And as for viruses, some of them are crucial to our survival. For instance, about eight percent of our genetic material was created by retroviruses, a special variety of virus that invades human cells and literally becomes part of our DNA. So viruses and bacteria aren’t inherently bad – far from it. But a handful of them are deadly indeed. Just take the bacterium known as Yersinia pestis. It’s responsible for causing the Black Plague, which killed upward of 30 percent of Europe’s population in the fourteenth century. Some other nasty bacteria include salmonella, E. coli and tetanus bacillus, while the long list of deadly viruses includes Ebola, HIV, smallpox, flu and rabies. Prior to 1900, influenza (a viral infection) and pneumonia (an inflammation that can be viral or bacterial) were major killers, responsible for more deaths out of every 100,000 patients than any other disease. Nowadays, it’s rare to hear of someone dying of the flu. How did we beat back these pathogens? Well, you’re going to get the long answer, which is the story of the discovery of the immune system. The field of immunology can be traced back to a mystery – or, rather, three mysteries: the mysteries of a chicken, a dog and a starfish. Let’s start with the chicken. One day in the sixteenth century, while dissecting a chicken, a young Italian anatomist named Fabricius ab Aquapendente discovered a mysterious organ. Located beneath the bird’s tail, and shaped like a pouch, it served no apparent function. He named it the bursa, a word that’s etymologically related to the English word “purse.” But what was this tiny avian purse good for? No one had a clue. Almost a century later, in 1622, another Italian, Gaspare Aselli, dissected another animal – a dog this time – and encountered yet another enigma. In the animal’s stomach, he found “milky veins,” a discovery that didn’t jibe with the seventeenth-century understanding of the circulatory system. Wasn’t blood supposed to be red? Again, no one could explain this oddity. More than two centuries later, in 1882, yet another discovery was made on Italian soil – though the discoverer this time was a Russian zoologist. Élie Metchnikoff was visiting his sister in Sicily when he had his eureka moment. While working alone one day, Metchnikoff put a spattering of starfish larvae under his microscope. Inside these minute, transparent organisms, he observed what he called “wandering cells” – cells that seemed to drift around the bodies of the starfish. His brain made an instantaneous, revelatory jump. What if these itinerant cells weren’t as purposeless as they appeared? What if they were wandering watchmen, in charge of defending the starfish against intruders? He immediately tested his hypothesis. From the garden he collected some rose thorns and inserted them under the skin of a few starfish larvae. Then he went to bed. The next morning, he observed that the wandering cells had gathered around the thorn – and that they were busily consuming the damaged tissue. Metchnikoff’s experiment led to the phagocyte theory – “phagocyte” is Greek for “devourer of cells” – which posits that, when invaded, the body’s first reaction is to swarm the breach with these devouring cells. This cellular self-consumption is what laypeople call inflammation. But how did the cells know that there had been an invasion? Attempts to answer this question – and to explain the mysteries of the white-blooded dog and the bursa of Fabricius – gave rise to the field of immunology. It was the late 1950s, and Dr. Jacques Miller had a lot of dying mice on his hands. Whenever a new mouse died – and that happened regularly – Dr. Miller would cut it open and see the same thing: a little mouse liver covered in lesions. Each mouse had been ravaged by severe infection. What happened to these poor mice? And who is this scalpel-happy Dr. Miller? Well, he was a French physician working in London, and he had deprived these mice of an organ that, until his experiments with it, was as mysterious as the bursa of Fabricius. This organ is called the thymus. After the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, researchers worldwide began to study leukemia, incidences of which had skyrocketed in those cities. Central to that research were – surprise, surprise – mice. In a grim nutshell, researchers gave mice cancer by exposing them to radiation, hoping to hit upon discoveries that might help irradiated Japanese citizens. During this research, an oddity emerged: some mice, though they hadn’t been irradiated, developed leukemia spontaneously. This spontaneous development took place in the thymus, a tiny organ situated just above the breastbone. Dr. Miller, who’d decided to study leukemia in the early 1950s, was, by the late 1950s, on the verge of making a discovery that would turn this unassuming organ into a central player in the immunological field. In an early experiment, Dr. Miller injected mice with leukemic filtrate, a liquid infused with ground-down cancerous tissue from a leukemic mouse. After injecting both baby and adult mice with this filtrate, he observed something puzzling: the baby mice would develop leukemia; the adult mice wouldn’t. Why? To find out, he began removing mouse thymuses. In subsequent experiments, he injected a newborn mouse with leukemic filtrate, waited for the mouse to reach adulthood, and then replaced its mature thymus with the thymus of a baby mouse. He did this with many mice, and, without fail, they developed leukemia as soon as they were given the immature thymus. He expected he was on to something. The thymus-less baby mice made him certain. As you’ll remember, these poor mice died of infection, against which they’d clearly been rendered utterly defenseless. The thymus, Dr. Miller posited, wasn’t a useless mystery organ; it was a key component of the immune system. What is self and what is alien to self? What is a part of you and what is other? How does the body know, for instance, which bacteria to attack and which to let alone? When Dr. Jacques Miller was conducting his research, there weren’t any definitive answers to such questions, but one thing was certain: the immune system could distinguish between self and non-self, though sometimes it would mistake help for harm. For instance, it was well-known that skin grafts usually went horribly awry. Though it might initially seem to accept the new skin, the human body would ultimately reject the foreign tissue. This knowledge helped Dr. Miller clinch his thesis that the thymus was crucial to the immune system. The body of a normal mouse, endowed with a thymus, would, like a human being, reject skin grafts from other mice. When Dr. Miller grafted skin onto the mice whose thymuses he’d removed, however, there was no such rejection. Indeed, he successfully managed to graft skin from four different mice onto a single mouse, which ended up growing tufts of multicolored fur. Possession of a thymus equaled skin rejection. Lack of a thymus meant no skin rejection. After making this observation, Dr. Miller did an array of blood tests on these thymus-less mice, and he found that all of them had a very low number of a certain type of blood cell – known as a lymphocyte – that has only one nucleus. He deduced that the thymus was responsible for producing these lymphocytes, and so he called them thymus-derived cells, or T cells for short. But the question remained of how these T cells could identify and attack pathogens. Back in 1891, an immunology pioneer named Paul Ehrlich had offered one theory. He thought that certain cells in the human body carried a sort of biological set of “keys” – he called them side-chains – that could fit into corresponding “locks” in the pathogens. Once the human cell found the right key and fitted it into the pathogen’s lock, the body could begin fighting the intruder. He named the keys antibodies and the locks antigens. Dr. Miller assumed he’d discovered the cell central to the immune system – the equivalent of the special key-carrying cells postulated by Ehrlich in the nineteenth century. This assumption – much like Ehrlich’s theory – turned out to be partially true. The whole truth was even more wondrous and complicated. In 1954, the bursa, that pouch-like organ that had so puzzled the young Italian Fabricius ab Aquapendente, finally got its moment in the scientific limelight. A researcher discovered that removing the bursa from chickens severely hindered the animals’ ability to produce antibodies. In other words, if you removed the bursa, you significantly reduced the number of antibodies. Why was this a big deal? Well, it’d been discovered earlier that decade that lacking antibodies meant trouble – big time. In 1951, a very ill boy was brought to Walter Reed General Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. After conducting a series of tests, doctors determined that the boy wasn’t generating antibodies – and they knew he was extremely unwell. He’d had pneumonia 18 times in as many months, not to mention a raft of other deadly infections. This told the doctors, loud and clear, that if you didn’t have antibodies, you were in for an awful time. Now, back in the early 1950s, the details of how antibodies work wasn’t yet understood – but it’d been established that they’re found on lymphocytes, those blood cells that have only one nucleus. But here’s the thing: the boy’s thymus was fine, his blood contained lymphocytes and his body could defend itself against some viruses. In other words, all the known components of the immune system were functioning. So what, exactly, was wrong with him? The conundrum of this boy’s case carried over into the next decade. In the mid-1960s, a physician named Max Cooper began studying an uncommon disorder called Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. People with this condition were, like the boy without antibodies, extremely susceptible to infection. Their immune systems, like the boy’s, barely functioned. Dr. Cooper began conducting autopsies on people who’d had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and, bafflingly, they had plenty of lymphocytes and fully functional thymuses. Then Dr. Cooper had an epiphany: there must be two types of lymphocyte, not one – and each must have its own origin. By that time, Dr. Miller had shown that T cells derive from the thymus. But there had to be another type, and it had to come from somewhere else. If you’re waving your hand in the air, thinking, “I know, I know – the bursa of Fabricius!” then get ready to have your bubble burst. Because humans don’t have a bursa. In the end, after another series of experiments, Dr. Jacques Miller proved Dr. Max Cooper’s hypothesis.  He discovered that there are indeed two types of lymphocytes – T cells and B cells – and that the B cells originate in bone marrow. These cells make up about 40 percent of human white blood cells – cells that, in addition to explaining the mystery of Gaspare Aselli’s white-blooded dog, are absolutely crucial to survival. To explain how B cells and T cells work, let’s imagine you’ve been infected with the flu. Upon infection, your body responds without precision. A bunch of cells – the cells that constitute the other 60 percent of your white blood cells – rush to the site of infection. It’s precisely such cells that Élie Metchnikoff observed swarming inside the wounded starfish larvae. At this point, your body doesn’t really know what it’s defending itself against. And that’s where the T cells and B cells come in: they provide precision. T cells are covered in little spikes, and some of these spikes can recognize pathogens. When that happens, a T cell can either go fight the pathogen itself or send B cells into the fray. B cells, meanwhile, have antibodies. Sitting on the surface of the B cell, an antibody is a protein molecule that can best be imagined as an antenna or a key. Remember Paul Ehrlich’s side-chain theory – the idea that certain cells carry a set of “keys” that can fit into pathogens’ “locks”? Well, the reality is much stranger. Each B cell – and your body has billions and billions of them – is equipped with a single “key” or “antenna” (that’s the antibody) that matches the exact “lock” or “signal” (the antigen) of a single organism. How does a particular antibody find its particular antigen? They’ve got to run into each other – literally. A B cell might roam your body for years – or forever – without finding the antigen to its antibody. How would this look in the case of you and the flu? The virus expresses a certain antigen, and the instant a B cell with the right antibody encounters it – boom! – they bind together, and the B cell destroys it or initiates a wave of other defenses. If you’re wondering how our body knows which antibodies to encode for, then hold on to your hat, because you’re about to find out. Imagine you’re in a foreign country. While there, you take a swim in a lake. A bit of water gets up your nose, and in that water is a malicious bacterium that neither you nor any of your ancestors has ever been exposed to. The antigen it expresses is utterly foreign to your entire system. How can your body possibly possess an antibody that corresponds to it? Meet Susumu Tonegawa, a Japanese researcher who, in the 1970s, while working at the Basel Institute for Immunology, discovered what the author calls the infinity machine. By this point, researchers had established something seemingly obvious. If you took a particular organism – say, a T cell – and isolated a particular section of its genetic material, this section would match the same section of genetic material in other T cells perfectly. Now, Tonegawa had been doing this with B cells – particularly, B cells that were still developing. And when he compared a particular segment of an immature B cell to the same segment in other immature B cells, he got an unsurprising result: the segments matched perfectly. Then the breakthrough came. Tonegawa did the same thing, but instead of comparing the immature B cells to each other, he compared immature B cells to mature B cells. What he observed was remarkable. The genetic material had changed. No other cells work this way – just B cells. In short, the genes that encode antibodies are unique, in the strictest sense of the word. How does this enable your body to detect an alien bacterium? Here’s how: Each immature B cell shares some central genetic material in common – but, in addition to that material, there’s a ton of other genetic material. As the B cell matures, much of that other genetic material falls away. Here’s the twist: each cell loses different genetic material. A huge bundle of genetic coding homes in on a specific genetic strand. This process enables our bodies to produce trillions of different antibodies. To use the lock-and-key metaphor again, our B cells carry keys so strange and specific that they may never meet their lock. Indeed, such locks may not even exist. By producing an infinity of solutions, our bodies can face the infinite threats of the world – and then some. When your body is invaded by a pathogen, an array of defenses is set in motion. You’re now in a position to understand how these defenses combine. First, the generic defense. Remember the phagocytic cells observed by Élie Metchnikoff? Well, they come in a variety of different forms. One of these is the neutrophil. These cells constitute about 50 or 60 percent of your white blood cells, and they’re naturally drawn to infection. When they reach the infected site, they inject the pathogen with an enzyme that destroys it. The neutrophil, as though exhausted by this strife, then begins to dissolve. Interesting fact: pus is composed of dead, dissolved neutrophils. After this, other cells come in and begin cleaning up the mess left by the neutrophils. Meanwhile, the targeted defense is already underway: dendritic cells, which are covered in tiny branch-like protrusions (dendron means “tree” in Greek), carry a sample of the intruder to T cells, which then decide whether it’s benign or malignant. Either that happens, or a roaming T cell or B cell encounters the intruder directly. These cells then fit lock into key and, if the invader is deemed dangerous, set off a highly precise defense, producing defenders trained to fight the intruder. But this raises yet another puzzling question: How can T cells and B cells tell friend from foe? You know that B cells possess antibodies capable of binding with pretty much any antigen. But it’s not only pathogens that express antigens; friendly bacteria express them too. So how does your body differentiate between the two? This question was answered in the 1990s, after two pioneering researchers, Ruslan Medzhitov and Charles Janeway, discovered that we essentially have two immune systems. You’re now familiar with the adaptive immune system. It can learn. Once it’s exposed to a particular pathogen, it remembers, and becomes better at fighting this pathogen in the future. However, though B cells and T cells can recognize billions of antigens, they have no way of knowing whether to attack without input from a second system, known as the innate immune system. Central to this system is the Toll-like receptor. This receptor, which appears on, among other cells, dendritic cells, is able to recognize generic pathogenic traits – things like nucleic acids, which are associated with viral infections, and a type of large molecule characteristic of particular bacteria. Once a cell with a Toll-like receptor detects a pathogenic trait, it sends a confirmatory message to the T cells – Enemy! – which then, like generals, begin directing other cells to go wage war. By now, you’ve got a pretty firm grasp of how the immune system works. There’s one more component – how cells communicate with one another. Your body is essentially equipped with an all-natural telecommunications system. It works like this. The body’s cells are capable of communicating with one another by secreting a protein called a cytokine. For instance, if your body has been invaded by a pathogen, cells near the invasion will release cytokines that pass news of the intruder to other cells. This news can spread through the entire body in mere hours. Cytokines can be thought of as messengers. But they don’t carry messages; they are the message. If there’s been a pathogenic invasion, the message is to attack. Take, for example, the cytokine known as interferon. Let’s say you’ve inhaled a virus. When a healthy cell determines that there’s an invader, it will release interferon, which makes it harder for the virus to proliferate. Other healthy cells pick up on the interferon, and begin generating more of it, thus making life difficult for the invading virus. But here’s the thing: interferon has some unpleasant side effects. You know what it’s like to have a virus, right? You start to feel awful. Your skin aches. You suddenly feel drained of energy. Well, it’s not the virus that makes you feel this way – it’s the interferon. By making you feel achy, hot and weary, your body is encouraging you to rest so it can mount a defense. Not all cytokines tell your body to go on the offensive, however. Many of them are there to ensure our immune systems don’t overreact.  Such regulatory cytokines are called interleukins. These cells actually discourage your immune system from attacking. The immune system has to maintain a fine balance. After all, it can’t dispose of malicious invaders by nuking the entire Festival of Life. It can’t mount an indiscriminate attack. If it did, you’d die. It has to be extremely careful, targeting only malicious organisms while protecting the rest. As you’ll learn in the next blink, however, malignant organisms can use this fact to their advantage, co-opting the body’s defenses and employing them for their own villainous purposes. It’s time to meet Jason Greenstein. Jason and the author had been friends since childhood – and Jason had always been a vibrant human being, living life his own way. As a teenager, he was a talented athlete, dominating the basketball court, but he never flaunted his skills or mocked less able players. He always encouraged the author, for instance, who was not nearly as physically adroit as Jason. As an adult, he became a serial entrepreneur, driving all over the United States in his busted-up van, pursuing one eccentric idea after the next. All that is to say that Jason was alive. So it was a shock when death came knocking. Jason was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma when he was in his forties. This is a cancer of the immune system. It’s called lymphoma because it attacks the lymphatic system. You’re probably familiar with lymph nodes – those tiny lumps that, if you palpate the right spot, you can feel on either side of you neck, just beneath your jaw, as well as in your armpits and other places. These nodes are sort of like command centers for your immune cells. The lymphatic system is like a series of highways along which they can travel. Hodgkin’s lymphoma lodges in this system, fooling your defensive cells into thinking it’s one of them. It does this by attacking B cells, turning them malignant and then using them to control the immune system. Here’s how: All T cells have a receptor called PD, which stands for programmed death. When it needs to, this receptor tells the T cell to self-destruct. Why would it do this? Well, as you know, the immune system needs to maintain a balance between aggression and regulation, so it must be capable of destroying as well as producing cells. Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells have a ligand – a molecule that binds to cell receptors – called PDL-1. Like cloaked assassins, the malignant B cells roam the lymphatic system, binding to healthy T cells and instructing them to commit cellular suicide. Meanwhile, the immune system doesn’t recognize these assassins as foreign, and protects them. Cell by cell, the cancer takes over the immune system. Here’s the good news: this type of cancer tends to respond well to chemotherapy. About 90 percent of all cases are curable with chemo. Here’s the bad news: Jason belonged to that other ten percent. Jason had always been a fighter. So he fought. He did chemotherapy – then, when he went into remission, another bout of chemo. When that didn’t work, he had a bone marrow transplant, which wiped out the cancerous B cells (and the healthy ones, too). Still, the cancer came back. These procedures are devastating in the extreme. Jason’s ability to produce normal blood cells had been severely compromised, and he was neutropenic, meaning he had critically low levels of neutrophils, the white blood cells that act as the body’s first responders. Jason was desolate, his body utterly decimated. Giving up began to sound better than fighting on. Indeed, he was too weak to undergo any further approved treatments. Then – a miracle. Jason’s physician obtained one-time permission to treat him with a new drug that hadn’t been approved for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Called nivolumab, the drug essentially countermands the cancer’s instructions. Rather than being told to self-destruct, the immune system is told to attack. It was far from certain that the treatment would work. Jason’s physician told him his chance of surviving was one in twelve million. But he did survive. Before the treatment, Jason had had a huge tumor on his back. A month after starting nivolumab, his tumor was gone, and he’d lost 15 pounds, which is how much the tumor had weighed. Six weeks after starting the drug, Jason was in complete remission. This is where Jason’s story should end – and, indeed, it’s the moment when the author decided to write a study of the immune system. But interfering on behalf of the immune system is as deadly as leaving malignant cancer untreated. After the remission, Jason underwent a risky treatment. His stem cells were replaced with his sister’s. Quite literally, he received a new immune system. He seemed and felt better for a while. Then the complications set in. They were small complications at first, then larger ones. In June of 2016, a bit more than a year after his nivolumab treatment, his liver failed, a sign that his immune system was waging war against his body. He experienced extreme inflammation, indicative of a cytokine storm – a huge, chaotic response to perceived invasion, which sends the immune system into overdrive. It can easily kill you. Jason took his last breath on August 10, 2016, overwhelmed by his body’s own defenses. Jason’s story may not have a moral. But it does tell us this: our immune system, the most powerful, elegant defense system known to humankind, can also be utterly deadly. We tamper with it at our own risk. The key message in these blinks: The immune system must maintain a delicate balance. If it’s too aggressive, it can kill us; if it’s not aggressive enough, it leaves us vulnerable to malignant pathogens. The field of immunology has a rich and fascinating history, and its pioneers laid the foundation for the incredible immunotherapies that are being developed today. Still, though our knowledge of the immune system has increased exponentially over the last hundred years, we’re far from being able to control our elegant defense. Actionable advice: Don’t stress, and get plenty of sleep! When you’re stressed, your body produces adrenaline, a hormone that, among other stimulating effects, increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Long ago, when humankind’s main stressors were animal predators, this was a good thing: adrenaline makes you alert and ready to run. Nowadays, though, our stressors – such as work deadlines – usually aren’t life-threatening. But here’s the thing: adrenaline can be addictive. The author learned this firsthand. He got hooked on a high-stress work routine, burning the candle at both ends and riding the rush of stress-induced adrenaline. The consequences weren’t pleasant. This pattern disrupted his immune system’s fine balance, and he became severely depressed. He was able to achieve balance again by sleeping – the body shuts down its adrenaline-producing system when you sleep – and meditating. So if you’re struggling with stress, try to follow his lead.

What to read next: On Immunity, by Eula Biss As you now know, the immune system can learn. T cells and B cells can bind to pathogens and then develop precise defenses against them – defenses that stay in place in case that same pathogen attempts to invade in the future. This is how vaccines work. By injecting a small amount of a pathogenic virus into our body, we give our immune system the chance to devise defenses against it. But vaccines are a hot-button topic. Despite the fact that they’ve saved millions of lives from diseases such as polio, many people distrust them, believing that they cause autism and other forms of mental impairment.  Interested in the cultural history underlying people’s misapprehensions? Wondering how to tell fact from falsehood in the vaccine debate? Then we highly recommend checking out the blinks to On Immunity, by Eula Biss.",

    "title": "Animal, Vegetable, Miracle",
    "author": "Barbara Kingsolver, with Steven L. Hopp, and Camille Kingsolver",
    "summary": "Maybe you live in the city. Maybe you live surrounded by vast fields of green. Either way, you have the opportunity to sow your own seeds, to cultivate and grow them and, finally, to eat them. And it doesn’t stop there. You also have the opportunity to stand against the horrific methods of big food corporations. Pretty cool to be able to serve home-grown veggies when you invite your friends over for dinner, right? And let's see how happy they’ll be when you assure them that everything is pesticide-free. There probably won’t be much left over. In Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, the authors pull you into the universe of growing your own food. You’ll learn when to sow what and when to expect what to grow. Starting by revealing some truths about today’s food industry, they give you an immediate incentive to grow your own veggies and to go hunting for that asparagus yourself – that is, outside the supermarket. In these blinks, you’ll discover why people still buy the products of big food corporations; what to look for when you go hunting for asparagus; and which plantings to expect during the months of spring. Living in the city for so long has removed us from the process of food creation. Foods now have bizarre, made-up names; foodstuff is imported and exported all over the world. For the most part, we’ve entirely forgotten about local farmers. It’s true that most people today want products from local, organic farmers. Nonetheless, they tend to purchase those products from giant food corporations. These corporations use synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and genetically modify their products in order to produce them cheaply – a far cry from the local, organic food people crave. Most people are fully aware that most animals destined for consumption endure horrific conditions before being slaughtered. But as long as prices stay low, people will buy from giant corporations instead of their local farmers’ market. People even complain about the high prices of organic meats and vegetables. But prices are high for a reason: farmers personally tended to those vegetables and took great care of those animals. Moreover, the calories we consume today come in forms that are hardly recognizable when compared to real food. After World War II the US government relied on chemical fertilizers to guarantee a cheap, steady supply of corn and soybeans in order to produce high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils, and to feed cattle and poultry. But that production never slowed down. Today, American farmers still produce 3,900 calories per citizen per day. People are consuming way more calories than they require, often without knowing it. Finally, genetically modified (GM) plants are almost ubiquitous in the US food supply chain, and are often difficult to avoid. Genetically modified food does not have to be labelled as such, meaning that, even if you don’t want to eat GM foods, the food industry has nonetheless figured out how to get them into your body. In fact, the people running the industrial farms have strategy meetings to discuss new ways of getting you to consume all these surplus calories, resulting in widespread obesity. If you want to eat real food, then you’ll have to grow it yourself. But growing your own food isn’t the easiest thing in the world, and it will definitely be tempting to buy those delicious-looking greens from your local supermarket in the wintertime. However, if you plan ahead, you can eat vegetables from your own local garden year round. Spring is the best time to start this garden. Come March, start planting. You can even do this indoors. The author and her daughter, for instance, started by simply planting their veggies and flower seeds under fluorescent lights. When March rolls around again, you might still be eating your winter supply from the last harvest! The highlight of this month is asparagus, which you can find growing wild. This can be difficult, though. The asparagus spears that you may have seen only look like that for a single day if left unpicked; they grow so rapidly you can almost see it happening in real time. If you pick it, it will simply keep growing. Later, during the month of April, the climate gets warmer, and everything starts to blossom. So prepare for action in your garden! The earliest blooms you’ll encounter in April are the vegetables that do well in cool weather and don’t mind a bit of snow. For example, if you planted potatoes in February, when it was still pretty cold outside, your potatoes are likely to be ready for harvest in April. Other plants in this category are onions, peas and the Cole crops, like broccoli, kale, cabbage and so on. Spring is also the season for spinach, kale, endive and baby lettuce. Just imagine a plate of greens still warm from the sun, with a handful of walnuts and some goat cheese, and you’ll start to truly appreciate the beauty of real food. The summertime can transform each and every one of us into a passionate gardener and cook. All you have to do is reconnect with your gardening roots. Though most of us aren’t farmers or gardeners, we may still feel some dim nostalgia for a simpler time when people lived off the land. Go ahead and embrace that feeling. Don’t let the fact that you live in the city deter you from gardening! A small balcony is all that’s needed to start your own little garden. In fact, container gardening on your balcony can afford you enough space to grow tomato plants, basil or any of your favorite veggies. If you’ve made the effort to start a small garden in the spring, then you can reap plenty of rewards in the summer. July is the month of squash (zucchini, crookneck, heirloom), eggplants and cucumbers; August is the “red month,” full of tomatoes. Perfect for any of your favorite dishes! Another benefit of growing your own greens is that you can cook the “fruits” (and veggies!) of your labor. If you cook for yourself, you’re more likely to keep yourself and your family healthy, and even save some money in the process. By cooking your own food, you can more easily control both the quality and the quantity of your ingredients. Cooking can also be quite relaxing, and even therapeutic. Cooking food that you’ve grown yourself helps you connect with and get to know your ingredients, not to mention learn about the benefits they hold for your body. Just remember: working hard in the garden and the kitchen brings rewards that make it all worthwhile. When the weather changes, our eating habits change with it. We start consuming foods that will give us the warmth and strength to survive the cold of winter. Often, that strength comes from animals. Although not everyone can raise animals, those who do must know how to do it right. Animal harvesting is a controversial practice, considered by some to be a cruel ritual. However, unlike the mere killing of an animal, harvesting implies planning and respect – an effort to make the animal’s life as good as possible before it’s slaughtered for consumption. Animals in industrial farms, however, are inhumanly killed, not harvested. That is, not a second thought is given to the terror and pain these animals suffer prior to their death. Furthermore, the conditions in which these animals live are beyond deplorable: the animals get little or no exercise, waiting in darkness and discomfort for their final day. But the harvesting of animals can be done in ways that don’t cause fear or pain. The author recounts a story of how she and her family decided one September day that it was time to harvest some of their roosters. To spare it a painful death, they would grab the rooster by the legs and turn it upside down, causing it to fall asleep. They then put its neck gently onto a block, quickly and painlessly decapitated it and then drained it of blood. After the animal harvest in September, October brings delicious potatoes and pumpkins. Potatoes are a great source of carbohydrates, which fill you with energy. They are best planted as soon as the soil can be worked, so you should probably start stirring up in March, around Saint Patrick’s Day. Pumpkins are another marvelous treat for the autumn table. They are the largest vegetable we consume, and can be used in many recipes. There’s not much gardening to be done in the winter. Rather, these icy months invite you to stay indoors and explore what you’ve stockpiled in your freezer. But are you sufficiently prepared for winter? There’s one thing you should definitely be sure of: that your freezer is stocked with meat and fats, like fish and nuts. Without these nutrients, both your body and mind might suffer. We need meat and fatty food to keep our bodies warm and energetic, especially during the wintertime. Chicken, beef, turkey or even fish serve your body’s metabolic cravings for fatty food and help it maintain its energy stores. People who live in places with little daylight and colder temperatures are even advised to eat more seafood, which helps the body fight depression. Indeed, neurological studies have revealed that those omega-3 fatty acids in ocean fish counteract the blues. You can also find omega-3 in pasture-finished beef. Because you won’t have any crops from the garden that need to be eaten right away, winter is the perfect time to get creative in the kitchen. Open your freezer and use whatever vegetables you have. It could be grated zucchini, broccoli and greens for salads or sliced apples for pies, and you’ll probably have tons of squash for soups, vegetable pies and stews. You can even freeze pesto for a quick and delicious pasta dish in winter. You can make pesto out of pretty much any veggie – tomatoes, basil or any other greens. And it’s easily stored in small jars or plastic bags. When you want to eat some pasta, all you have to do is grab a jar from the freezer and set it in some hot water. Once unfrozen, mix the pesto with the pasta, add a few olives, dried tomatoes and a bit of parmesan and – presto! – you’ve got a delicious meal. The key message in this book: Even if you live in the city, you can still experience the joy of gardening. Whether you do it on your balcony or in a community space, gardening will familiarize you with your food, save you money and improve your diet. Got feedback?

    "title": "Ask Me About My Uterus",
    "author": "Ab",
    "summary": "Contracting a chronic illness is something many of us fear. But what if you did become seriously sick, only to find that no one believed you? This is the nightmare scenario 19-year-old Abby Norman faced when she awoke in terrible pain one day.  In these blinks, you’ll learn about Norman’s fight to get the medical profession to take her and her pain seriously. Delving into the history of women’s health, you’ll discover the shocking truth: that female suffering is often trivialized and ignored. By chronicling her harrowing struggle with endometriosis, Norman lifts the lid on the experiences of millions of women around the world and shines a light on those experiences of disability, shame and chronic pain. Part intimate memoir and part exposé of medical sexism, these blinks explore one young woman’s fight against the gendered inequality of the healthcare industry.  In these blinks you’ll learn the disappointing way doctors treat women in pain;  what it feels like to live with debilitating endometriosis; and  the reason why Abby Norman established an online forum for women’s health. Abby Norman was just 19 years old when the onset of excruciating pain changed her life forever. A student at New York’s Sarah Lawrence College with a prestigious scholarship, her days were packed with literature, dance classes and friends. But one morning in 2010, dreadful pain – unexplained and unbearable – would rip her new life away from her.  That fateful morning began like any other. Abby got out of bed as usual and headed to the shower.  Still only half awake, she climbed into the shower and turned on the faucet. But the moment the water hit her body, she knew something was terribly wrong. Suddenly, it felt like someone was stabbing a knife through her midsection. She desperately patted down her body with her hand, trying to determine the source of the pain. She quickly realized it was everywhere, though not anywhere her hands could touch. The agony radiated out from deep within her body.  As she stood there, trying not to move, the stabbing sensations changed into a terrible ache that rolled over her abdomen and pelvis before snaking around to the base of her spine. Overcome with dizziness and nausea, she managed to stagger back to her room.  During that short but agonizing trip from the bathroom to her dorm room, Abby had little idea that she was also heading toward a new future as a chronically ill person. And almost immediately, this mysterious affliction began to destroy her life.  The rest of the day passed in a blur of pain and fitful sleep. So did the day after that. Lying down comfortably was out of the question, as was sitting up. Eating was impossible too. When the weekend came, Abby went to her part-time job and collapsed as she made the coffee.  Finally, after a week of agony, she sought medical help. Why did it take her so long? Well, like many Americans, Abby did not have adequate health insurance. While her college friends could stay on their parents’ insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act, Abby was totally estranged from her mother and father. Financially independent and without family help, Abby was terrified of racking up medical debts. Nonetheless, after seven days, her pain eclipsed her fears about money, and she dragged herself to the hospital.  But the doctors wouldn’t provide the answers for which she was looking, as we’ll see in the next blink. Over the next year, Abby sought the advice of several doctors. However, they were unable to produce an accurate explanation or a cure for her pain, and they also failed to take her suffering seriously. In fact, in the 12 months after that terrible shower, Abby received little from her doctors beyond patronizing behavior and misdiagnoses.  The first doctor Abby saw, for example, assumed her symptoms must have something to do with her sex life. When she tearfully replied this was impossible as she was a virgin, he gave little other explanation. Instead, looking deeply uncomfortable with her crying, he prescribed strong antibiotics and as much cranberry juice as she could drink. He didn’t even offer her a CT scan, which would have helped explore the problem further. After a week without improvement, Abby got a second opinion. This doctor suspected an ovarian cyst was to blame, merely because of her age. Then he shrugged and advised her to seek the opinion of a gynecologist.  As Abby was bounced from doctor to doctor, her life crumbled. The precious scholarship that made her studies possible was conditional on her grades, but as her pain forced her to skip class and lie in bed, her performance was suffering as much as she was. Before long, the college told her to pack her things and go, promising she could return when she was well again.  But the gynecologist that Abby saw next failed to return her to either her health or her studies.  After giving her an agonizing vaginal ultrasound, this doctor said she could find nothing physically wrong. But when her patient’s symptoms worsened again, she undertook exploratory surgery on Abby’s reproductive organs.  When Abby awoke, the doctor apologized: she did have an ovarian cyst, she said, but she had failed to see it on the ultrasound. It was so large that it had twisted up one of her fallopian tubes, causing her agony. When she heard this, Abby assumed that the doctor had removed the cyst, the damaged fallopian tube, and her ovary too. After all, they were clearly the cause of her terrible pain. But shockingly, all the gynecologist had done was drain the cyst and bind up the affected areas with dissolvable fabric. Removal of the ovary, she explained, might have affected Abby’s fertility.  Afterward, Abby was dumbfounded. Why had her fertility been prioritized over stopping her pain?  Predictably, just a few months later, her pain returned. Devastatingly, Abby’s problems were not limited to an ovarian cyst. How did she know this? Well, after her pain returned, she desperately began researching her symptoms. Delving deep into medical textbooks and research papers, she eventually hit on the underlying cause of her pain: a disease called endometriosis.  Although endometriosis is thought to affect between 2 to 10 percent of women, frustratingly little is known about it.  What we do know is that endometriosis occurs when cells similar to those lining the womb somehow end up in other locations such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic cavity. Though the presence of these cells may cause no discomfort for some women, for others, the pain is comparable to the agony of childbirth. The dominant theory about why endometriosis happens was put forward in the 1920s by John Sampson, a gynecologist. He believed the disease was caused by menstrual liquid backwashing out of the uterus, up the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity, where it remained and caused patches of endometriosis.  Despite Sampson’s theory existing for nearly a century, today it remains neither proved nor disproved. This is down to an absence of investment and interest on the part of a male-dominated medical profession. Compare, for example, the sheer amount of research undertaken on liver disease, which affects a similar number of people. A search of PubMed, the online health research database, returns 30,000 pages of research. But search for endometriosis, and you’ll find just 1,800.  This lack of research is a problem because there are many unanswered questions surrounding Sampson’s theory. Indeed, recent evidence suggests it may be plain wrong.  Just consider the fact that patches of endometriosis have been found in places as far away from the uterus as the lungs, the eyeballs and even the brain. If menstrual backwash really did put them there, then how did this backwash travel so far? Is it plausible that women’s fallopian tubes are behaving like high-pressure hoses, shooting fluid into the far reaches of the body? And there’s also another problem with Sampson’s theory: a 2015 case report by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine notes that patches of endometriosis have been found within the pelvises of fetuses. And given that fetuses definitely do not have periods, it seems that endometriosis is not solely related to menstruation. Endometriosis is a very real and debilitating disease. Nonetheless, during her quest for an accurate diagnosis, several doctors advised Abby that the cause of her pain was psychosomatic, meaning that her illness was all in her head. Though this might seem extraordinary, there is a tragic history of women with reproductive diseases being wrongly diagnosed with mental illnesses.  A shocking example of this medical gaslighting comes from comedian Gilda Radner, one of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live.  In the 1980s, at the height of her fame, Radner began to experience severe tiredness and a high temperature during menstruation. After her period ended, though, she would feel better. Convinced there was something wrong, Radner saw a gynecologist who said she was simply experiencing the normal discomfort of menstruation. But soon her symptoms worsened, and she began to experience pain in her stomach, legs and bowels. Nonetheless, the next doctor she saw told Radner she was just a nervous woman who needed to loosen up; another claimed that her problems were all related to anxiety.  Refusing to give up, Radner sought yet another opinion. This doctor gave her an antidepressant. Finally, after ten months of agony, a blood test confirmed what Radner had known all along: her problems were not emotional at all. She had stage four ovarian cancer, and at that point, it was too late for effective treatment. Two years later she died from the disease.  She was just 42 years old.  In the final months of her life, Radner wrote her memoir, It’s Always Something, in which she described her battle to get doctors to take her pain seriously. Decades later, Abby Norman read Radner’s book and easily related to her struggles.  On hearing that Abby was estranged from her parents, for example, one doctor suggested that her mental health might be to blame for her terrible pelvic pain. Other health professionals thought she was overly stressed, not enjoying herself enough or not having enough sex – and that these were the causes of her physical problems. One physician casually suggested she had probably been sexually abused in childhood, and that her symptoms were her body’s coping strategy. Later, he remarked that her illness was complicated and that she was complicated too. Endometriosis has robbed Abby Norman of many things. Her education, for one: she was too ill to return to Sarah Lawrence College to finish her degree. As you’ll see, it also robbed her of her sex life. In this respect, though, the disease also gave her something back in return: awareness. Specifically, an awareness of how differently doctors respond to your health complaints depending on whether you’re a man or a woman.  Endometriosis has made sexual intercourse, like many other activities, unbearably painful for Abby.  In the summer after her troubles began, Abby had sex for the first time. It was with her first boyfriend, Max, and this first sexual encounter was so painful it brought tears to her eyes. She had been prepared for that, though – like many women, she had been warned that the first time would hurt. But it wasn’t just the first time. Every time she and Max had sex, it caused a suffocating pain in her pelvis. After intercourse, there was always blood on the sheets, accompanied by nausea and a throbbing ache that reached all the way to her thighs.  After a year of struggling through painful sex, Abby could no longer continue. Accompanied by Max, she visited her gynecologist again to discuss the problems she was experiencing.  The session astounded her.  With Max on hand to verify her pain, the gynecologist suddenly began to take Abby’s complaints more seriously and enthusiastically offered suggestions. Moreover, when Max communicated his own sexual frustration at the situation, the doctor seemed to listen even more. It seemed clear that now Abby couldn’t perform in the way she was expected to, thus putting a man’s sexual satisfaction at risk, the doctor was stirred into action. Abby was encouraged to try different contraceptives, including an IUD. She was given physiotherapy to strengthen her pelvic floor muscles, advised on new sexual positions to try, and even sent for electrical nerve stimulation. Although nothing worked, it was almost equally frustrating to Abby that her pain alone wasn’t enough to persuade her gynecologist to act, but the prospect of male disappointment was.  After several years together, Max and Abby broke up. He was too sexually frustrated, he said, and had started to resent her for being ill. Their relationship was just another thing that endometriosis had stolen. The extent to which men and women biologically differ is a subject of fierce debate. Nonetheless, there are some verifiable differences between the sexes. Women, for example, have a higher amount of fat to lean body mass. Despite physiological differences like this, scientists have historically excluded female subjects when studying the human body. Instead, men have been seen as the human “average.” But equally disturbing is that in other health contexts, women and men are seen as different, even when there is no basis for this discrimination.  Sadly, all this adds up to inadequate healthcare for women.  Scientific researchers, for example, routinely under-research women. In 2011, the British Journal of Sports Medicine reported that out of 1,382 research studies related to exercise and sports, including six million individuals, female representation was just 39 percent. Why were so many women missing from these studies? Because the researchers decided that menstruation made them just too “complex” to study.  Furthermore, research trials involving pharmaceutical drugs have typically excluded women – partly because of the apparent risk that a woman might be unknowingly pregnant. For instance, although a large scale study in the 1990s found that taking aspirin was effective in preventing stroke and cardiovascular disease, this study failed to include any women at all. Studies like these are a big problem because scientists now know that women and men metabolize many drugs differently, from anesthetics to antidepressants.  When it comes to suffering, too, female pain is often disturbingly overlooked.  A 2001 study published in the Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics found that after heart bypass operations, male patients were frequently given painkillers, whereas women were given sedatives. Furthermore, the study found that even when women were given painkillers, they were given less than their male counterparts, even after controlling for body-size differences. Why were the females given sedatives? Because the medical community views women as being anxious rather than in pain. This goes back to the depressing “it’s all in your head” attitude that women such as Gilda Radner and the author have had to battle in their fight to be taken seriously.  Today, Abby continues to live with endometriosis and chronic pain. Although her condition limits her daily activities, she remains determined to live a full and meaningful life. In her new career as a science writer, for instance, Abby is working hard to raise awareness about this debilitating illness. And as we’ll learn in the final blink, her efforts are helping thousands of women. In some parts of the world, menstruating women are locked away from their communities. In certain places in India, for example, they are sent to special huts where they’re forced to stay for days, considered too unclean to be seen. But whereas the menstruation hut, historically known as the red tent, is a terrible reality for some women, for others it is a painful metaphor. They may not be physically ostracized, but when it comes to their reproductive health, they still feel completely alone.  Abby Norman is fighting to change this.   During her struggle with endometriosis, Abby has often turned to the internet, not only to research her condition but also to reach out to other people who are battling the disease.  When Abby first plugged herself into the online conversation about endometriosis, what she found both amazed and saddened her. Women all over the web were reporting the same challenges: physicians who refused to believe their pain was genuine, and the constant fear of losing their partners because they were unable to have sex. There were women who suffered constant bouts of nausea, and many who were struggling to eat because their endometriosis was so bad. Plenty of people had also quit their jobs because of the disease or were dangerously close to doing so.  Importantly, these women hailed from all walks of life, races and age groups, but many had one thing in common: though they had the debilitating symptoms of endometriosis, they had not received the clarity of a proper diagnosis.  After witnessing the depth of this collective suffering, Abby decided to take action. She wanted to give these women a voice – and a community.  Her quest began with an online survey. Through Twitter, Abby sent out a call asking anyone with endometriosis to share their experiences with her. In particular, she focused on asking LGBTQ people and ethnic minorities to complete her survey – two groups whose health experiences tend to be underreported. From these humble beginnings, she built an entire virtual community called Ask Me About My Uterus. Aiming to lift the lid on women’s health issues, her website features writing about reproductive health topics like menopause and periods, as well as endometriosis.  These days, Ask Me About My Uterus is an online community of over 10,000 readers and contributors. With this vital project, Abby has shown that, although a cure for endometriosis may be some way off, the red tent that conceals women’s health issues is finally being dismantled. The key message in these blinks: Endometriosis is a woefully under-researched disease that devastates the lives of millions of women. Unfortunately, many sufferers of endometriosis also face a medical culture of disbelief and sexism, leaving them isolated and ashamed of their illness. Abby Norman has experienced this discrimination first-hand and now uses her blog to give a voice to other endometriosis patients.  Got feedback?

    "title": "Beat Sugar Addiction Now!",
    "author": "Jacob Teitelbaum and Chrystle Fiedler",
    "summary": "Our bodies need energy. And within our bodies, sugar is converted into potential energy. Hence, our bodies need sugar – and since most of us like sugar so much, it would seem a perfect match! So, why not grab another Snickers bar or drink a Red Bull to boost your energy? Well, you’re probably aware that the energy boosts provided by sugar are rather short-lived, and that a diet high in sugar is terrible for your body and overall health; it can even cause chronic illness. What’s more, it’s likely that you’re actually addicted to sugar without being aware of it. It’s therefore time to kick that sugar habit once and for all. These blinks will introduce to you four different types of common sugar addictions. You will learn what causes these habits, how they affect your body, how to spot the symptoms and, crucially, how to beat your sugar addiction. In these blinks, you’ll learn why “energy drinks” never live up to their name; how stress can make you a sugar addict; and how you may have fungal bacteria growing in your gut. You’re probably familiar with the energy drink Red Bull. Perhaps you even like it, drink it once in a while or just enjoy the attractive staff at their promotional events! But beverages like Red Bull can be dangerous. An overconsumption of energy drinks – that is, soft drinks with high doses of caffeine – is linked to the first major type of sugar addiction: type-1. People who struggle with type-1 sugar addiction are often perfectionists. They’re only satisfied with what they consider the best, whether they’re at work, school or home. They don’t have time for all the activities they want to finish during the day, so they grab an energy drink to keep them going. And going. A Red Bull might feel refreshing to a perfectionist when they’re chugging it down – but in the long run, it doesn’t help. Energy drinks don’t really boost your energy, they just wear you out. The term “energy drink” doesn’t just apply to sugary drinks like Red Bull, but to caffeinated soft drinks as well. These drinks can suck you into a vicious cycle, which goes something like this: You feel tired, so your body craves sugar to boost your energy level. Hoping to wake up, you reach for an energy drink. The drink gives you a boost, which makes you feel better in the short term, but then leaves you feeling depleted again afterward. A few hours later, your body needs another boost, so you crave an energy drink again and reach for another one. Repeat. This cycle can be tough to break out of, but there’s still hope if you’re a type-1 sugar addict. We’ll take a look at this next. Do you feel daily fatigue because of the energy drinks you consume? If so, it’s time to SHINE! The SHINE method helps you overcome fatigue by quelling your sugar addiction. SHINE stands for Sleep, Hormonal support, Infections, Nutritional support and Exercise. Let’s go over what each of these means. First off, sleep. Be sure to get in eight hours of sleep every night. Your body craves sugar when you’re not getting enough sleep because it needs more energy to keep you going. Next, hormonal support. It’s possible you’re tired because your thyroid, the gland in your neck that releases the hormones that extract energy from food, isn’t active enough. An insufficiently active thyroid makes you feel tired and crave sugar. A physician can treat this condition according to your individual needs. Infections comes next. Sugar addiction flattens your energy levels, which weakens your immune system. A poor immune system, in turn, makes you more susceptible to infections, like the flu. There are a number of ways you can improve your immune system, such as by consuming more zinc, which is found in multivitamin supplements. Foods high in protein give your immune system a boost too. You also have to consider nutritional support. Be sure to eat plenty of whole foods, like unprocessed fruits, vegetables, grains and meat. Whole foods are critical to a good diet because they contain a lot of nutrients and much less sugar than processed or prepared foods. You can also supplement your diet with vitamins; your body doesn’t crave sugar nearly as much when it has all the vitamins and minerals it needs. Finally, exercise! Exercise boosts your energy and suppresses your sugar cravings. You don’t have to run a marathon to “exercise;” you can start by taking a 30-minute walk just four to seven times per week. Do you get irritable when you’re hungry? If so, have you ever wondered why? It’s not just because you miss the taste of your favorite snack – you’re probably suffering from a type-2 sugar addiction. Unlike type-1, a type-2 sugar addiction is associated with high levels of daily stress, which deplete your body’s adrenaline reserves. Everyday life can be stressful. That stress, in turn, causes your adrenal glands to produce more cortisol and adrenaline, the hormones that prevent your blood sugar level from dropping too low. When you’re perpetually stressed out, however, your adrenal glands become overworked, which causes your blood sugar level to drop. So what do you do? You reach for an artificial substitute: sugar. But sugar only gives you a short-term boost, so your blood sugar level soon drops yet again. And when you don’t have enough sugar, or glucose, in your blood, you might start feeling anxious and wanting food urgently. If you don’t get it, you’ll start to feel light-headed and will get even more anxious. Type-2 sugar addicts are often women, or anyone under pressure to please a lot of people. Modern-day women, for example, often have demanding jobs, but are still expected to be the primary caregivers for their children while taking care of various housekeeping tasks. It can be extremely stressful to balance a business, babies and cleaning the house, so when these stressed-out people feel sluggish, they reach for a sugar boost. Type-2 sugar addicts tend to take care of everyone else’s needs before tending to their own. Such behavior eventually backfires, however, and a person with a type-2 addiction may well end up lashing out at someone else when she gets hungry. You can overcome a type-2 sugar addiction by slowing down your busy lifestyle, but type-2 addicts usually don’t see that as an option. So, if you can’t cut down on your jam-packed, daily schedule of activities, go for the next best thing: get your adrenal glands back to their normal level of functioning. How can you do this? Give your body the nutrients it needs to recover, so that it can stabilize your blood sugar level. A stable blood sugar level, in turn, will make you less fatigued. You can do this by cutting back on sugar, caffeine and white flour. It goes without saying that you should stop eating refined sugar and caffeine, which only make your blood sugar drop. White flour isn’t healthy for you either, because it converts into sugar once it enters your body, which is then quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. Whole grains are much healthier because your body takes more time to process them, leading to less sudden spikes or dips in blood sugar levels. Also, remember to eat foods that are high in protein – and don’t forget to snack. Your body loves high-protein foods like cheese, nuts, beans, eggs, fish and meat. Protein takes a long time to break down in your body, and as your body digests it, your blood sugar level will remain stable for hours. Snacks are another important part of your daily diet. A high-protein snack such as mixed nuts, cheese or a hard-boiled egg every few hours helps maintain a healthy blood sugar level, so forget anything you’ve been told about only eating three big meals a day. You might already know that sugar ferments in your gut. But did you know that candida albicans, a kind of yeast, grows from that fermented sugar (don’t worry, it’s different from the yeast you bake with!)? Yeast thrives in an unhealthy way when your gut has too much sugar in it. It makes you crave even more sugar by releasing a chemical that, as of yet, remains unknown. You feed the yeast when you eat more sugar, making your sugar cravings even stronger. It’s an unhealthy, vicious cycle that can lead to an overgrowth of yeast in your gut. This excess sugar leaves you with a weakened immune system, increased fatigue and possibly even fibromyalgia, a condition that causes chronic musculoskeletal pain, severe fatigue and memory problems. You’re a type-3 sugar addict if you suffer from a yeast overgrowth – and there’s a good chance your diet is all about sugar. The daily diet of a type-3 sugar addict might start with coffee and a donut, which leaves him wanting more sugar a few hours later, leading him to get a Snickers bar from the vending machine at work. Lunch, dinner and the sugary snacks in between are packed with sugar or foods like white bread that quickly convert into sugar once they enter the body. Type-3 sugar addicts will probably keep sweets, cakes or cookies at hand for the moments when their sweet tooth kicks in. If you have a diet like this, sugar has taken over. Fortunately, it’s possible to overcome a yeast overgrowth in your gut. Let’s see how. It’s simple: if you don’t want to get drunk, don’t drink alcohol. If you don’t want to feel sleepy during the day, don’t take a sleeping pill. A yeast overgrowth works the same way. You can get rid of a yeast overgrowth by starving it – that is, by depriving it of sugar. Yeast thrives on sugar, so you need to cut it off at the source. Eliminate those cakes, cookies and other unnecessary sweets and snacks from your diet right away. There are four additional steps you need to take as well. Start by maintaining a healthy diet rich in protein and low in sugar. Be sure to get plenty of whole grains, vegetables and fruit. You may need prescription drugs like Diflucan, an antifungal medication to beat a particularly bad overgrowth. Natural remedies like antifungal herbs can also help. You’ll probably get indigestion or acid reflux if you only use one antifungal herb, so use a variety of them in small doses instead. Coconut oil powder, grapefruit seed extract and milk thistle, to name a few, all have antifungal properties. Supplement your diet with extra nutrients, too. You'll starve the yeast in your gut and improve your immune system as you replace sugar with healthy nutrients like zinc. A chronic disorder, like chronic fatigue syndrome, for example, can cause zinc deficiencies. Zinc plays an important role in your immune system, so if you don't have enough of it, you might want to take some zinc supplements (15 to 25 mg daily). Ensuring proper levels of vitamins A, C and D is also an important step to a healthy body and higher energy levels. The final step is to check if you have any food allergies, since an allergy can make your sugar cravings even worse. You could also try the Multiple Food Elimination Diet approach by eliminating certain foods one by one to see if any of them are causing your health complications. Does your mood change in the days leading up to your period? Do you feel cranky or irritable, or start to crave sugar? If so, you might be a type-4 sugar addict. Type-4 sugar addiction is caused by hormonal changes in a woman's body due to insulin resistance. Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, might be the culprit here. PMS refers to a variety of symptoms women experience during their menstrual cycle, such as crankiness or sugar cravings. There's still some debate surrounding PMS, but most scientists agree that it's related to low levels of the hormones progesterone and prostaglandin. Hormones like progesterone naturally fluctuate during a woman's menstrual cycle, but they're at their lowest during her period. When your body has a deficiency of these hormones, you will start to crave sugar. You will indeed get a short-term boost if you eat some sugar, but it'll soon wear off and you'll be back to craving sugar again. Why? It might be because of insulin resistance. Insulin is the hormone that regulates your blood sugar levels. It serves as a gatekeeper that gives the sugar you consume access to your cells, allowing it to fuel your body. If you suffer from insulin resistance, however, your body doesn't get the fuel it needs. In a body affected by insulin resistance, cells don’t respond normally to insulin. As a result, the sugar in your body can't reach your cells, so it builds up in your blood instead. This causes your cells to crave sugar, but the sugar still won't enter the cells – even if you continue to eat more of it. Your body produces more and more insulin in an attempt to regulate your blood sugar level, but it doesn’t have the desired effect. In the end, you’re left feeling fatigued, depressed and still craving sugar. Wouldn’t it be great if you could eliminate all the uncomfortable symptoms related to your menstrual cycle with a few magic words? While that isn’t possible yet, we still have some effective alternatives. Start by adapting your diet to start weaning yourself off sugar. Go with a high-protein, low-sugar diet, and stay clear of junk food, processed food, white flour and sodas. If you have an insulin resistance, change your diet according to the wellness prescription, a long list of natural remedies that help alleviate certain PMS symptoms such as sugar addiction. The wellness prescription includes remedies like primrose oil, certain kinds of fish and various vitamins. Certain natural remedies can be very effective in dealing with PMS and sugar addiction, particularly in symptoms caused by a deficiency of prostaglandin. Vitamin B6, for example, makes it easier to cope with low levels of prostaglandin, also known as the “feel good” hormone. Take 150 to 200 mg of B6 on a daily basis for three to six months, and you'll start to feel less cranky and less in need of sugar during your period. You might also want to treat your hormone deficiencies with bio-identical hormones. Stay away from synthetic hormones; they won’t do you any good. According to a study by the Women’s Health Initiative, synthetic hormones like Provera, the synthetic alternative to progesterone, may even be harmful. Bio-identical hormones, on the other hand, can be very useful. Numerous studies have proven the positive effects of bioidentical hormones, such as a 2000 study in the Journal of Women’s Health and Gender-Based Medicine, which outlined a number of cases in which people reported an improved quality of life when switching from synthetic hormones to natural ones. The key message in this book: Sugar addiction, like any kind of addiction, is detrimental to your health. If you suspect sugar is taking over your life, you likely have one of the four kinds of sugar addiction. Fortunately, it’s possible to regain control of your sugar consumption habits and get back on track toward a healthier lifestyle. So, figure out what route is best for you, and get to work!

    "title": "Body Kindness",
    "author": "Rebecca Scritchfield",
    "summary": "If you’ve ever tried to keep up with some new exercise plan or stick to that new diet everyone’s talking about, there’s a good chance that you started out strong but eventually drifted away from it. Don’t worry; it happens to most of us. And the reason why is that most of these self-improvement concepts are riddled with more rules and guidelines than any reasonable person can put up with for more than a couple of weeks. What’s really harmful is all the stress and guilt that comes with trying to measure your food, count your calories or, god forbid, miss out on a scheduled workout. If this sounds all too familiar to you, then you may enjoy hearing about body kindness, a different approach to feeling better about yourself – because isn’t that what dieting and exercise are supposed to be about? As author Rebecca Scritchfield explains, this approach is about putting aside strict rules and figuring out what is going to work for you based on your unique circumstances and what’s important to you. You’ll find plenty of tips and advice on how to relax, let some joy into your life and live healthier at the same time. In these blinks, you’ll find out how some diets can turn into food phobias; why you probably need more sleep than you’re currently getting; and how making a “PACT” with yourself can curb your negative thinking. When you think about the factors that contribute to happiness, do things like money, youth or a slim figure come to mind? Well, according to psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky, these factors only contribute to around 10 percent of a person’s overall happiness. Your daily choices account for 40 percent, while the remaining 50 percent comes down to your genetic makeup. The 40 percent that makes up your daily choices is a pretty significant factor to have control over, nonetheless, making the right choices requires a great deal of willpower. But the good news is that you can make it easier on yourself by developing good habits. If you repeat a healthy behavior often enough, you can turn that behavior into a habit that becomes second nature. In other words, you’ll reach a point where you won’t even have to think about it – it’ll just come naturally to you. For example, let’s say you want to be less frivolous with your time at home after work. Maybe your routine now is to absentmindedly waste time checking your Instagram feed or anxiously scamper around the house looking for something to do. Well, this time could be made more productive if you develop the habit of coming home, changing your clothes and doing 30 minutes of yoga. This would be a win-win scenario as far as your happiness is concerned. It’s not only a healthy practice; it would also help quieten down your mind after a busy day at work, and it would allow you to enjoy your evening more consciously. The positive effect that good habits can have on your life is something the author calls spiraling upward. The easiest way to understand this concept is to see it in action. Let’s say you want to increase your creative output. For instance, you could start spending 30 minutes doing some creative writing after breakfast. This will both spark your imagination and let you start the day with the positive feeling of being productive. Now, that positive feeling often carries over into another good decision, such as a willingness to do some exercise or a feeling of being energized enough to tackle some household chores. This is how a good habit can get you spiraling upward. Thus, the more positive habits you have in place, the better you’ll feel. This, in turn, will increase the chances that you’ll continue making good choices on how to spend your time throughout the day – and that will lead to even more good feelings! If you feel constantly worried about what to eat, you’re not alone. There’s no shortage of magazine articles, blog posts and social media conversations filled with fearful warnings about what you should and shouldn’t eat. So it’s no wonder that people obsess over their diet to the point that they’re at war with food – constantly fighting over the question of whether or not something is healthy or unhealthy. But here’s the irony: What’s really unhealthy is all that anxiety over what you eat! In fact, obsessing and being fearful of food is downright toxic. With so much being said about what’s healthy and what isn’t, certain foods have ended up in very distinct categories. Kale, for example, is healthy, while cupcakes are unhealthy. But all this means is that if you have one cupcake at a birthday party, you can end up feeling racked with guilt. And when that guilt turns into obsessing about which foods are considered okay, it can turn shopping and eating into a nightmare. Is this carrot organic? Should I only buy gluten-free bread? Can I eat any dairy at all? Am I getting enough antioxidants? The questions are endless. Ultimately, being overly controlling of what lands on your plate isn’t healthy because in the best case scenario, it adds to your levels of stress and anxiety, and, in the worst case, it leads to eating disorders like anorexia. Eating can be one of the great pleasures in life, so it should never have the toxic emotions of guilt and fear associated with it. But if that’s not convincing enough, there’s also the fact that forcing strict dietary rules upon yourself can often backfire. The author knows a woman named Susan who tried to cut bread from her diet at a time when she was obsessed about avoiding carbs. But not unlike the proverbial forbidden fruit, the more she tried to avoid bread, the greater her cravings became. The struggle became so intense that she even avoided certain social events where free appetizers of bread slices might be found sitting on the table. The temptation would have been too much! Fortunately, Susan decided to adopt a healthier approach to her diet, and with the author’s help, she allowed herself to have bread with one meal per day. This balanced approach not only removed the fear over an unavoidable food item; it also provided a sensible plan to avoid overindulging in it. Even if exercise isn’t your favorite thing to do, there’s a good chance you’ve had at least one workout that left your mind feeling clear and your body feeling a certain lightness and energy that only comes after physical exertion. There’s a good reason people feel this transcendence after a workout; it’s because exercise is among the best things you can do for your health. Here is a small sample of the many health benefits that have been found to come with regular exercise: decreased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer, as well as reduced symptoms of depression. Why does it provide these benefits? Well, during exercise, you’re pushing your heart and lungs to work faster, which means you have more blood pumping through your body. As a result, your body is more effectively distributing nutrients and nourishing cells throughout your body, including the ones in your brain. But despite all the benefits, 30 percent of Americans exercise only once a week or less, while the average American moves around for about 20 minutes per day! What this means is that, to feel healthier and happier, we need to find better ways of motivating ourselves to exercise. Often, the key to effective motivation is finding the right reason to do something. For example, if your reason for exercising is about superficial concerns like achieving the perfect body, this can easily lead to discouragement rather than motivation. That’s because it can be impossible to live up to the images of chiseled abs and perfectly sculpted bodies we’re bombarded with in ads and on TV. Once you feel you’re working toward an unachievable goal, you’re likely to throw in the towel. Instead of focusing on body image, the more effective motivation is to focus on body kindness, which is all about how healthy and beneficial exercise is for your emotional and physical well-being. And a great way to improve your chances of staying motivated is to find a coach or instructor whose work is grounded in this approach. To help you keep the philosophy of body kindness in mind, you can develop a mantra, such as reminding yourself each morning that doing some exercise today will be an expression of your love and appreciation for your body and mind. In the author’s experience, this body kindness approach to exercising has resulted in her clients exercising more often and with far more enjoyment. Are you one of those people who can wake up after just six hours of sleep feeling perfectly energized and restored? Well, if so, you can consider yourself special! Research shows that only 5 percent of the human population carries the genetic variation that allows them to fully recuperate after just six hour of sleep. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent of us require significantly more. Getting the right amount of sleep is about more than just getting some shut-eye; it’s vital to the well-being of both your mind and body. The benefits of sleep are numerous, not the least of which is that it helps you learn new things and enjoy more emotional stability. When you sleep, your brain has enough downtime to sort through the information you’ve acquired over the day. It then stores the important information and discards the rest. That’s right; sleep is basically a tidying-up session for the brain. While the brain is busy decluttering, studies have shown that we experience a series of sleep cycles, with each one lasting around two hours. Researchers also believe that we generally need to experience around four or five of these cycles per night in order to feel fully restored when we wake up. This is why most people need eight to ten hours of sleep. One of the most important parts of the cycle is what’s known as deep sleep, or slow-wave sleep, as this is the time when the body regenerates and produces important hormones that regulate metabolism. Another cycle is known as REM, or Rapid Eye Movement sleep, which is the lighter period of sleep when dreaming takes place. Your dreams are important even if you never remember them because they strengthen memory and assist in the brain’s processing of emotions. Lots of people can experience times when sleeping is difficult, but there are steps you can take to get a better night’s sleep. First off, turn your bedroom into a sleep sanctuary by taking anything out of your bedroom that isn’t necessary for sleeping. TV? Computer? Take them out and make space for them elsewhere. Next, make sure you have a clean and comfortable bed by washing your sheets regularly and investing in a mattress that is as hard or soft as you need it to be in order to have a long, deep sleep. Finally, always get to bed early enough to have the eight to ten hours of sleep you need, and get your mind ready to rest by staying away from all electronic devices at least an hour before you intend to sleep. With these simple practices, you should find it easier to get the sleep your body needs. There’s a good chance you’ve tried certain diets or exercise regimens that didn’t stick. Or maybe you’ve been to nutritionists and therapists but stopped when you believed they weren’t doing you any good. With enough of these experiences, you may start feeling hopeless and decide that you’re done with self-improvement plans altogether. If such thoughts sound familiar, don’t worry. Having them can happen to the best of us, and it doesn’t mean that you can’t follow through on whatever life changes you hope to make. A lot of self-help gurus will advocate for using the power of positive thinking, but there is a more effective way of dealing with the negative thoughts we have. The trick is to remind yourself that thoughts aren’t necessarily true, and they don’t need to be acted upon. So, the next time you recognize a self-critical thought, like telling yourself you’ll “Never stick to an exercise plan, so don’t bother trying,” remember that this is just an unsubstantial, intangible thought. It doesn’t have to have any power over you unless you decide to act upon it – and there’s no need to do so! In other words, just because you think something doesn’t mean you should let it control your behavior. Effective people doubt themselves all the time, especially when it comes to a challenging exercise goal, but they don’t let that stop them. Many people think that they’re too restless for meditation or that they’re going to hate a party they’re obliged to go to. But instead of letting these thoughts get in the way, they find that meditation changed their lives and they met some amazing people at the party. If you let negative thoughts control your actions, there’s little chance you’ll discover all the potential for new and wonderful things in life. A great tool for removing negative thoughts of their power over you is to make a PACT with yourself by practicing Presence, Acceptance, Choice and Taking action. Presence means having awareness and noticing a negative thought for what it is when it pops up. Acceptance is about not mindlessly reacting when negative thoughts arise, and instead observing the thought, accepting it as natural and considering what may have triggered the thought. Choice is recognizing that you are not beholden to act according to your thoughts and feelings, and can instead choose to do what is kind and positive for you and your body. Taking action means leaving your negative thoughts in the dust and following through on the act of kindness – using it to spiral upward to the next positive thing. Do you ever look around you and think, Why is everyone so serious? The author has not only had this thought; she’s even gone so far as to suggest there’s an ongoing fun famine, which is characterized by a general lack of silliness and too many people just going through the motions of mundanity. If you feel like your life could benefit from making the mundane more meaningful, here are some tips for doing just that. Let’s start with grocery shopping. Everyone needs food and water to survive, but the routine business of getting these things can easily become tedious. But it doesn’t have to be. After all, this is food we’re talking about! So instead of always buying the same old boring stuff, why not turn shopping into a treasure hunt for the tastiest, freshest and most delicious things you can find? There are all sorts of ways to get engaged and involved with shopping, such as making a point of buying at least one type of food that you’ve never tried before, searching out new places to buy your groceries from or hunting for the best bargains in town. When it comes to food, there are endless possibilities, so why not treat yourself to a little adventurousness? Another way to keep your day-to-day life more meaningful is to always be on the lookout for opportunities to laugh. You may think laughter is just an involuntary reaction to something humorous, but aside from being fun, it’s also one of the healthiest things you can do! Indeed, the act of laughing exercises numerous muscles and it also produces pleasure-related hormones like dopamine and serotonin, while reducing stress-related hormones like cortisol and epinephrine. Ultimately, this adds up to laughter being excellent for your body by creating deep states of relaxation. In order to benefit more from laughter, you can try to look at things in a more lighthearted way. For example, let’s say your morning pot of coffee tips over onto the breakfast table, and as you go to grab a towel, you find your child adding milk to the coffee by pouring it onto the table as well. One response to this might be anger, but it’s also a pretty comical situation, and you might find that laughter can make cleaning up the mess a whole lot more enjoyable. Now that you have some ideas for how to be kinder to your body and bring more joy into your day-to-day life, let’s see what it looks like when you bring these ideas together into a master plan. With a good plan in mind, you can have a strong foundation to rely upon – one that can provide ways for you to practice body kindness in every aspect of your life. A good way to start your own personalized plan is to create a mind map. All this requires is a sheet of paper and something to write with. Then, simply draw separate sections, such as large circles, to signify the different areas of your life. These often include things like work, exercise, nutrition and your social life. Now, in each of these sections, you can make some notes about improvements you’d like to make through the use of positive actions. One of the author’s clients, Sheryl, made a plan to help deal with different aspects of her life. These included an overwhelming amount of work, the loneliness she was experiencing after getting divorced and having her kids grow up and leave the house. These issues were causing Sheryl to come home from work feeling exhausted, and she would distract herself with fast food and binge-watching television. To find an effective plan, the author worked with her client to identify what was most important to Sheryl. Since she valued her friends and her social life, they made a weekly meeting with one or more friends part of her master plan. Not falling into the trap of being overworked and exhausted was also important, so part of the plan also became making sure she left work on time and got to bed by 9:00 p.m. with a book to help her fall asleep. Then, for an extra dose of energy and body kindness, they set a goal for Sheryl to exercise three times a week. It’s important to note that no part of this plan was unrealistic. It consisted entirely of relatively small, doable steps that added up to a big shift toward a healthier lifestyle, with Sheryl giving herself more kindness and a lot more joy. You’ve probably heard the saying “no pain, no gain,” which suggests that self-improvement requires fighting and pushing your way through discomfort. This can lead to people thinking it’s okay to be hard on themselves and to regularly dole out self-punishment, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Being harsh with yourself is far more likely to bring about exhaustion and cause you to give up rather than persevere. And that’s why practicing regular self-compassion is a far better method for success. Everyone has self-critical thoughts, whether it’s comparing themselves unfavorably to others or wondering if they’re doomed to always make the same mistakes. Self-compassion, on the other hand, is about taking the time to speak kindly to yourself. You can do this by making sure you acknowledge your achievements, instead of only dwelling on your mistakes, and by appreciating your strengths, rather than dwelling on your weaknesses. For example, let’s say you’re out of work and looking for a job. If another day goes by without an interview, you might feel like beating yourself up and calling yourself useless. But rather than giving in to that impulse, you can be kind and truthful by reminding yourself that searching for a job is a difficult task, no matter who you are. In fact, you can think of self-compassion as a way of looking after yourself and making sure you’re taken care of – especially when times are tough. And when you do this, you’ll find that you’ll experience fewer symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression, while feeling more optimistic – all the key benefits of body kindness! If you’ve been out of practice with self-compassion, you may not remember what this voice even sounds like. To get back in touch with it, just talk to yourself as you would to your best friend. Ask yourself, if your best friend was struggling to find a job or having difficulty managing her career while raising her kids, how would you speak to her? What tone of voice would you use? What words of wisdom would you offer? Would you call her lazy and be judgmental? Or would you remind her that she’s always shown impressive strength and perseverance? If she’s still your friend, then you probably spoke kindly and offered support, and that’s exactly the kind of tone and spirit that you should offer yourself, especially when times are tough. Rather than kicking yourself when you’re down, remind yourself that you’ve rallied your strength to overcome hardships before and that you can do it again. No matter what situation you find yourself in, you deserve to support and admire yourself for the amazing job you’ve done to get this far. With a solid master plan and a renewed commitment to self-compassion, you’ll be on your way to reaping the rewards of a more meaningful and joyous life. The key message in these blinks: Body kindness is a compassionate approach to health and fitness that replaces stressful, strict, short-lived diets. By creating a personal plan tied to your unique values and circumstances, you can find ways to work less, be more well-rested, eat the foods you love and experience more joy in life. By reducing the power of negative thoughts, learning to laugh more and practicing more self-compassion, you can use the tools of body kindness to take conscious control over your happiness. Actionable advice: Rediscover which activities you feel most passionate about. If you’re feeling a bit adrift in life, here’s a quick exercise that can help you re-familiarize yourself with your true passions in life. Imagine if you had one day to do whatever you wanted in life – no limits! Now, start brainstorming ideas and create a list of everything you come up with. Then, read over the list and put a star next to the tasks that get you really excited and energized. These are probably the kind of activities you need to spend more time on. Get cracking on that list, and think about how you can add more joy and excitement into your life by simply doing the things you love to do! Got feedback?

    "title": "Born to Run",
    "author": "Christopher McDougall",
    "summary": "Every year millions of people all over the world run marathons. You might think they’re all completely crazy or that you could never run a marathon yourself. Many of us secretly fantasize about being marathon runners if only this were possible. However, it doesn’t take a freakish, superhuman physique to cover 26 miles and 385 yards at a clip. You just need some training and the right attitude to get yourself off the couch. In these blinks, you’ll learn why dogs can’t run marathons; why most running shoes hurt us, rather than help us; and why the best runners run like kindergarteners. When you think of fast sprinters, your mind probably jumps to cheetahs or horses. But when it comes to running long distances, it’s actually Homo sapiens who take the lead. The reason? It’s in our physiology. For one, humans are able to dissipate heat more rapidly than other animals. Most other mammals don’t have the right glands in their skin to cool down via sweating, so their main method for releasing body heat is through breathing. When four-legged animals want to run fast, they break into a gallop. This method of running, though quick, restricts their breathing rate because the moving leg muscles squish the animal’s lungs like bellows. As a result, when running fast, most animals can only breathe at a rate of one breath per stride. This works fine for them – until they reach the critical limit at which they heat up faster than they can cool down. Then they have to stop running in order to survive. We humans, on the other hand, prevent overheating by sweating through our skin. As a result, the human breathing cycle is not determined by our need to cool down, making it more efficient at procuring oxygen and maintaining endurance. A second key factor that makes humans master runners is that we move on two legs instead of four. When early humans began to walk upright – thus freeing their hands to use tools and reach higher hanging fruit – it allowed their throats to open and chests to expand. Though this development came at the expense of sprinting speed, this new posture and the increase in air capacity enabled them to maintain running over long distances. Finally, our Achilles’ tendon is the third trait distinguishing humans as runners. Some 95 percent of human DNA correlates with that of our close genetic relative, the chimpanzee, but even these primates don’t have this flexible, rubber-band-like cord of collagen tissue in their lower leg. As it’s stretched, the tendon stores energy until it’s ready to be released when the leg propels the body forward. This maximizes our endurance because it takes us less energy to spring from one step to the next. As we’ve seen, we have many biological traits that work to our advantage as runners. Sometimes, though, we actually hinder our natural gifts with inventions that are intended to help. A key culprit here is running shoes, which are guilty of stabilizing the foot too well. When you run, your foot rolls inward in a process called pronation that acts as a built-in shock absorber for the lower leg. Unfortunately, pronation has been demonized as being responsible for runner’s knee, a painful and common ailment. As a result, we now see a fleet of pronation-alleviating shoes on the market, although a mere three percent of the population have a medical need for special shoes. For most people, encasing the foot in a shoe is a lot like having a plaster cast on the leg. The shoe limits the foot’s full movement, causing the muscles to atrophy and the foot to lose strength. The resulting imbalances throughout the body put excessive strain on certain muscles and joints and can lead to injury, which is why taking running shoes out of the equation might actually be better for you. Consider Alan Webb, the greatest mile runner in the United States, who suffered from foot injuries while still in school. Part of the problem was that Webb had flat feet with low arches, which are not well-suited for running. Thanks to various barefoot running exercises, however, his feet strengthened, and his arches rose dramatically – so much so, in fact, that his size 12 feet now fit into size nine or ten shoes, and his foot injuries abated. Another problem with running shoes is that they mask the discomfort caused by harmful impacts against the ground. Thickly cushioned shoes fail to alert runners to the painful shock waves that reverberate through their bodies as they pound the pavement, thus preventing them from adopting less harmful running forms. Barefoot running, on the other hand, forces the runner to adapt a natural, and ultimately more comfortable, gait. OK, so now that we’ve gotten rid of the shoes, what’s next? Sorry to say it, but your bacon habit might have to bite the dust if you want to become a champion runner. Despite Western society’s current vogue for diets based around lean meats, cutting out meat entirely is probably your best bet. If you need evidence, just look at some of history’s greatest endurance athletes, many of whom were vegetarians. Japanese marathon-running monks, for instance, would complete 25,000-mile ultra-marathons on a daily provision of miso soup, tofu and vegetables. Or take Percy Cerutty, coach to some of the greatest runners of all time, who strongly advocated a vegetarian diet. He often pushed his clients through triple sessions on a simple diet of raw oats, fruits, cheeses and nuts. Elite ultra-runner Scott Jurek took it even further and switched to a vegan diet. Despite being told that he wouldn’t recover from workouts and would be more susceptible to injuries, he proved his doubters wrong and performed better than ever. A vegetarian diet is especially well-suited for running long distances because foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains help you extract the maximum nutrition from the fewest calories. As a result, the body is spared from carrying and processing any additional bulk. Furthermore, your body digests proteins much more slowly than it does carbohydrates. That means that when you eat meat, you’re wasting a lot more time waiting for the food to be processed by your digestive system. Think about it this way: less meat means more time to train and fine-tune your running skills. And don’t worry about being malnourished on a meat-free diet, because a diet of grains, legumes and vegetables possesses the amino acids essential for muscle production. They allow for recovery while keeping you ready to run at any moment due to their comparatively brief digestion time. Now that we have the right equipment and diet, let’s move on to the next step in becoming a skilled runner: the right training! If you’ve ever watched Olympic sprinting and marathon events back to back, you’ll know that they might as well be two completely different sports. For instance, the ideal sprinting posture, with a straightened back, steady head, and large, forceful strides, is astonishingly different from the way Kenyan athletes choose to run – and, given that Kenya is an elite nation in long-distance running, we might want to pay attention to how they do it. Ken Mierke, an exercise physiologist and world champion triathlete, set out to discover the Kenyan secret. After watching hours of footage of barefoot Kenyan runners, he discovered that these world-class athletes actually run like kindergarteners. The key was moving the legs in smaller contractions to enable quicker foot turnover. This technique increases efficiency and fosters endurance that is ideal for running long distances. Ken came up with a creative, if unusual, idea to help athletes adapt to this form: he set metronomes to 180 beats per minute and attached them to his athlete clients, instructing them to match their pace to its tempo. After five months, a 60-year-old client who’d been a runner for 40 years in the top 10 percent of his age group saw significant improvements in his trial time. His running résumé proved that the improvements weren’t simply the gains of a beginner and that anyone could apply the metronome method to their own running. Once you’ve got your form down, the next thing to master is the art of pacing. In order to achieve this, start by trying to stay below the aerobic threshold – that is, the point at which you begin breathing heavily. This will help you utilize your fat stores instead of burning through your sugar reserves. This is important because the average person has enough fat stored to run very long distances. Unfortunately, the mistake that many runners make is running too quickly and using up their sugar tank, which is far more limited than the fat. Pacing will help you to capitalize on the fat reserves and keep you running longer and further. The Tarahumara people live in settlements scattered among the canyons of northern Mexico. What’s their connection to running? “Tarahumara” roughly translates to the “running people.” They’re aptly named, because they are well-known for their ability to regularly run 200 miles in a single session. Not only this, but they also avoid the running injuries typical of the modern world. This elusive tribe lives in isolation and shuns outsiders, the reason for which stems from their mistreatment at the hands of Spanish colonizers. Since that time, the Tarahumara have preferred to stick with one another and experience the natural joy of running. To find out more, the author enlisted the help of a local to track down the secretive tribe. After a marathon drive and two-day hike, they finally met face-to-face with Arnulfo Guinare, the most respected Tarahumara runner. Thankfully, despite his stand-offish reputation, Arnulfo welcomed them in and shared the secret to being an outstanding runner. The lesson from the Tarahumara was simple: learn to love to run. By creating a mind-set and culture based on the belief that running is an indispensable human skill, they’ve made it hard to be a part of the Tarahumara and not enjoy running. It’s seen as an ancestral necessity that makes them who they are as a people. Not only do they run for the sake of their tribe, but they also run for themselves. But this passion for running isn’t limited to only the Tarahumara people; it’s something many of us can relate to. Do you remember running around with total abandon and delight when you were a child? The fact is, running can be a blast. Although we’re often conditioned to lose this sense of pleasure, the Tarahumara have not forgotten this feeling – and it’s something you should relearn, too. The key message in this book: Many people are unaware that we humans have a host of innate traits that make us excellent long-distance runners. One of the most important things you can do for your inner runner is to make sure you don’t hinder these inherent gifts – go barefoot and remember the natural joy of running! Actionable advice: The next time you’re thinking about throwing away $100 on a pair of flashy running shoes, think again. Save the money and your health by opting to go without them entirely. Run on a flat sole like a true Tahamuran if you want to improve your running prowess. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Brain Maker",
    "author": "Dr. David Perlmutter with Kristin Loberg",
    "summary": "It is said that the way to a person’s heart is through his stomach. It turns out that the way to increased health and disease prevention may be through that exact same spot. Alzheimer’s and autism, depression and obesity are all diseases that could potentially be stymied, if not cured, by the right balance of miraculous little creatures that live in our guts – known as the gut microbiome. It turns out that the health of your brain is closely linked to the health of your gut. Gut bacteria provides your body with valuable vitamins and helps to ward off infection, not to mention other nasty bacteria that would rather trigger inflammation and lay siege to your system. The good news is that you can have a say in which group of bacteria prevails, and in doing so, join a whole new world of disease prevention by being smart about what you eat. Reading these blinks, you’ll also discover how the chemicals in your plastic notebook could make you fat; how good gut flora may curb autism spectrum disorder symptoms; and why a tasty, turmeric-heavy curry can make your brain grow. The human gut is colonized by tons and tons of bacteria. A thought that’s not only strange, but also perhaps a little gross. Yet here’s another strange fact: these colonies play a huge role in your health. Let’s start with how much you weigh. Interestingly, the type of bacteria you’ve got in your gut can determine whether you stay slim or become obese. Two groups of bacteria are accountable for some 90 percent of your gut’s microbiome – firmicutes and bacteroidetes. While scientists don’t know the “ideal” ratio of these groups, they do know that when you have more firmicutes than bacteroidetes, you can suffer from increased inflammation and potentially from obesity. Firmicutes are expert at extracting energy from the food you eat, which means that they help you consume more calories. In contrast, bacteroidetes aren’t so much involved with calorie extraction but work to break down plant fibers and starches. Harvard researchers examined the connection of obesity and a person’s microbiome, focusing on two groups: people living in Western countries and in Africa. Considering that obesity is virtually non-existent in Africa, any differences in microbiome were viewed as notable.   And what researchers found was indeed notable. Africans had more bacteroidetes in their gut, while Westerners had more calorie-extracting firmicutes. So having more firmicutes may be at least partly responsible for the obesity epidemic in the West. Your microbes not only help to keep you slim (or fat) but also help support your liver. Many foods contain environmental toxins; it’s the liver’s job to get rid of these once in your body. Yet a healthy gut can also support the liver in its work, which is why the gut is often called the body’s “second liver.” Gut microbes help to neutralize toxins that reach the intestines, acting as a first line of defense. In doing so, the microbes take a bit of pressure off the liver, keeping it healthier! When an insect bites you, often the skin around the bite gets red and may itch. This redness is called inflammation; a process the body sets in motion to protect you and keep you healthy. Yet sometimes inflammation can get out of control and actually be harmful. Most people think that inflammation is just a patch of irritated skin or a swollen, sore throat – but it is often much more. The body’s inflammatory response is there to support the immune system and help it fight infection or injury. But when this response persists without reason, it can lead to a wide range of illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, asthma, arthritis or even multiple sclerosis.   But what exactly would trigger excessive inflammation in the body? Some genes can contribute to excessive inflammation; yet for this to happen, these genes need to be “switched on.” Thankfully there are things that you can do, such as getting enough sleep and eating healthily, that will keep these bad genes quiet while kicking into gear the more helpful genes. Too much blood sugar can also increase inflammation in the body, as high blood sugar levels can be toxic if your cells aren’t able to process it. This situation can lead to glycation, a state in which sugar binds to proteins or fats, which causes a buildup of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). And AGEs trigger inflammation. So while a little inflammation can help you fight disease, too much can have negative consequences when it comes to your body and your health. But did you know that your gut microbiome can also trigger inflammation that potentially leads to mental health problems? Read more in the next blink. Did you know that your brain and your gut are actually connected? If your gut microbiome is imbalanced to the point where it no longer is assisting the immune system in protecting the body, your brain could be in peril, too. Your gut is mostly busy absorbing nutrients from food during the day. While it’s performing this task, it must be protected from potential pathogens that could harm you. As a means of defense, the gut has a protective layer of cells that are responsible not only for absorbing nutrients but also for blocking harmful bacteria. If this cell layer becomes compromised, the gut’s defenses are weakened and potentially harmful bacteria could wreak havoc in your body. Having an inflamed, “leaky” gut can thus lead to other, more serious illnesses. Research now shows that an inflamed, leaky gut can potentially lead to a so-called leaky brain. This rather horrifying idea means that the brain, previously believed to be securely protected by the blood-brain barrier, can actually be exposed to harmful bacteria from the body, too. If bad bugs get into your brain, this can lead to brain inflammation. And when your brain suffers from inflammation, a lot of damage can be done before you even know that something is wrong. Why? The brain doesn’t have its own pain receptors; so unlike an inflammation of the skin (which you can see and feel), an inflammation of the brain is a silent sufferer. Yet brain inflammation is serious business. This symptom can lead to illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease or other severe neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s and depression. Even disorders like autism may be caused by what’s happening in your gut, as we’ll see in the next blink. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a perplexing condition. Scientists still don’t know what causes it, and while many therapies attempt to address ASD symptoms, there’s no known cure. Examining the gut microbiome, however, may help us to better understand and treat ASD. ASD covers a wide range of conditions that are expressed during early brain development. People with ASD often avoid eye contact, prefer to be alone, have difficulty expressing their needs and display repetitive behavior, among other behaviors. One hypothesis is that problems in the gut microbiome might contribute to the development of ASD. So far we’ve explored how issues in the gut can affect the brain and lead to illness. In the case of ASD, a similar situation may be at play. If brain inflammation exists during childhood, this might disrupt brain development, potentially resulting in ASD. Studies have found that many people with ASD possess a particular composition of gut bacteria that is typically linked to a heightened inflammatory response in the body.   Jason, diagnosed with ASD, was given multiple courses of antibiotics as a baby, which may have compromised his natural gut microbiome. When Jason was 10 years old, doctors did a stool analysis and found that he had almost no beneficial lactobacillus bacteria in his gut. Fortunately, the symptoms of autism can be alleviated by healing the gut microbiome. One treatment method is to give a patient oral probiotics and vitamin supplements, in order to cultivate a healthier gut microbiome. For Jason, this therapy led to some success. After only three weeks, he showed a decrease in anxiety symptoms. He was even able to tie his own shoes for the first time. A new treatment called fecal microbial transplant, or stool transplant, has shown promising results. In the treatment, a doctor extracts stool bacteria from a healthy gut and transplants it to a patient’s colon. This practice has proven effective at improving a patient’s compromised gut microbiome. Now that you know how important your gut microbiome is, how can you best care for it? It’s hard to say no to the delicious taste of sugar. Yet a particular type of sugar, called fructose, is today ubiquitous in prepared foods and drinks – and is wreaking havoc with our health. Fructose, found in processed and sweetened foods like soda and candy, is one of the most consumed sources of calories in Western nations. While fruit naturally contains some fructose, a fizzy soda is saturated with it. One 350-milliliter can of soda has around 140 calories from fructose sugar, whereas a medium-sized, fresh apple has only 70. Fructose has the lowest glycemic index (GI) of all the sugars, which means it has no immediate negative effect on blood sugar and insulin levels. Yet studies show that consuming too much fructose is related to insulin resistance – a condition in which the glucose-processing ability of insulin is compromised. This can contribute to diabetes and hypertension. Consuming a fructose-heavy diet can also stress out your liver (as well as compromise your health overall), as this organ in particular is responsible for metabolizing fructose – primarily into fat. Another substance that can be harmful to your health is gluten. Gluten is a protein found in grains and grain products; it gives elasticity to dough, for example. And it’s everywhere, in your pizza and pasta, even in your ice cream and cosmetics. And while only a small percentage of people suffer from celiac disease – gluten intolerance – many more people may have an averse yet often undetected reaction to gluten, known as gluten sensitivity. Gluten sensitivity can increase the body’s inflammatory response, which as we now know, can lead to a wide range of diseases. If you feel you may have gluten sensitivity, it’s best to avoid it in the foods you eat. In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin. One of the most important breakthroughs of the twentieth century, Fleming’s discovery ushered in the era of antibiotics. Unquestionably, the use of antibiotics has saved many lives. Yet today we take too many antibiotics, and in doing so, we’re compromising both our gut microbiome and our overall health. In 2010, doctors in the United States prescribed some 258 million courses of antibiotics – and the U.S. population is just over 300 million people. Often such prescriptions were for ailments that antibiotics can do nothing against, like the common cold. Another major – and unnecessary – use of antibiotics is in agriculture. Farmers often pump antibiotics into healthy animals, simply to make them larger and fatter. The excessive use of antibiotics is risky, as bacteria can quickly adapt and become resistant. Therefore the more antibiotics we use, the greater the chance that bacteria will evolve to develop a resistance. Scientists have observed this in strains of the staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Now resistant to a majority of common antibiotics, these bacteria can cause serious infections that can be fatal. Antibiotics can also disrupt your gut microbiome by killing healthy bacteria – giving an opportunity to harmful bacteria to take up residence instead. Along with antibiotics, many environmental chemicals can be damaging to our bodies and health. Of some 100,000 chemicals approved in recent decades in the United States, only 200 chemicals have been thoroughly safety-tested. One example of a problematic chemical is Bisphenol-A (BPA). Invented in 1891, BPA was used then both to alleviate menstrual problems and as a growth drug for cattle. However, it was found to trigger cancer and its use as a drug was banned. Yet since the 1950s, BPA has been used in the creation of certain plastics; you can find BPA in many items, from notebooks to cash receipts. Scientists have found that BPA exposure can not only disrupt the body’s hormonal balance but also alter the gut microbiome. What do wine, yogurt, sauerkraut and black tea have in common? They’re all fermented food products. Humans have benefited from the process of fermentation in food for some 7,000 years, and nearly every culture has some kind of traditional fermented dish or drink. It’s no surprise, as fermented foods are often good for your health. So what is fermentation? This organic process converts carbohydrates, like sugars, into either alcohol and carbon dioxide or organic acids. For fermentation to happen, either yeast, bacteria, or both are needed. It’s during fermentation that bacteria produce the valuable vitamin B12, for example. One particularly useful fermentation process is called lactic acid fermentation. Here sugar is converted to lactic acid, which increases the number of beneficial bacteria (often called probiotics) while safeguarding food from harmful bacteria, and spoilage. An easy way to consume probiotics is by eating unsweetened yogurt, created when milk undergoes lactic acid fermentation. Probiotic bacteria strains have many health benefits. They help increase the availability of vitamins, reduce inflammation and decrease the level of harmful bacteria in your gut. And when you eat fermented foods that contain beneficial bacteria, your body can absorb them more readily and thus benefit from them more than when you take probiotic supplements alone. The practice of fasting can also help boost your health. Fasting was first mentioned in ancient Indian Vedic texts, and people have been exploring the benefits of fasting for over 3,000 years. There are different ways to fast: you can restrict your caloric intake for a period of time, or you can not eat at all for 24 to 72 hours, as some examples. This latter practice is called intermittent fasting. Health benefits from fasting include increased insulin sensitivity, slowing the aging process and switching the body into fat-burning mode to lose weight. Fasting also promotes positive changes in gut bacteria. In one study, the restriction of calories encouraged bacterial growth connected to a longer life, while reducing the amount of bacteria associated with a shorter lifespan. Do you enjoy a spicy curry? Good for you if you do, as this means the yellow spice, turmeric, is already part of your diet. Turmeric is a popular Chinese and Indian seasoning that is often a component of curry powder, giving it a distinctive yellow color. But it’s more than just a spice – turmeric is also good for your body. This spice is chock-full of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities, and can even increase your brain’s cell count. Even though Chinese and Indian practitioners have been using it for thousands of years, turmeric was discovered by Western medicine only recently; research regarding its benefits is ongoing. Importantly, turmeric contains curcumin, an organic compound that can improve glucose metabolism, or the stabilization of blood sugar in your body. So if you’re not a huge fan of curry, you might want to consider taking turmeric or curcumin supplements to reap the compounds’ benefits. Another healthy “super food” is coconut oil. Coconut oil has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, and is believed to be able to prevent and possibly even heal neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. If you want to introduce coconut oil to your diet, you can use it as a cooking oil instead of canola oil, for example. Or you can consume it directly, one to two teaspoons of pure oil every day. While there are plenty of supplements available on the market, if you want to explore a more natural approach to health, taking turmeric and coconut oil are excellent options. The key message in this book: Your gut has far more to do with your health than you know. An upset gut is one of the main culprits in obesity and is linked to diabetes, dementia and even potentially autism. But you can improve the state of your gut microbiome and in turn your health by making simple adjustments to your diet, such as eating more probiotic foods. Actionable advice: Favor the filter. Chemicals like chlorine are bad for your gut microbiome, so you might want to consider filtering your water. This is simple to do and needn’t be expensive. Although you may want to look at more involved solutions like filtering your shower water, you can also just purchase a water filter jug to keep filtered drinking water on hand in your refrigerator. Try a probiotics chaser. The next time you need to take antibiotics, follow them with a course of probiotics. These are found in yogurt, sauerkraut or even probiotic enemas. Antibiotics kill bacteria en masse in your gut, including the good ones. This makes room for all kinds of bacteria that you don’t want, potentially resulting in diarrhea or prolonged inflammation. Probiotics can help you recover by introducing new, healthy bacteria into your system.

    "title": "Bulletproof Diet",
    "author": "Dave Asprey",
    "summary": "Put butter in your coffee. Seriously. That’s one of the major discoveries in Dave Asprey’s Bulletproof Diet – discoveries that have made it one of the most talked-about healthy eating breakthroughs today. The simplest way to explain the Bulletproof Diet is that it’s high in fat and vegetables, moderate in proteins and carbohydrates, and low in toxins and starch. But becoming bulletproof is more than that. It’s about understanding how your body works and how you can maximize its potential. It’s about learning why you should eat fats – as long as they’re the right ones – and why fasting can be OK for your body if you do it right. These blinks will explain all that and much more. After reading them, you’ll know why people are really putting butter in their coffee, and why you should too. In these blinks, you’ll learn which coffees have dangerous mold on them; why grass-fed meat is superior; and how eating more fat can make you think more quickly. A lot of people enjoy a cup of coffee before they run off to work in the morning, but they probably aren’t aware that coffee contains antinutrients: compounds that prevent your body from absorbing nutrients. They’re found in seeds, plants and beans and can be quite detrimental to your health. Most people are exposed to low doses of these antinutrients, like mold toxins, daily. They are in nearly everything we eat but are difficult to detect and invisible to the naked eye. Coffee beans naturally carry these mold toxins. In fact, one study of coffee beans grown in Brazil found that over 90 percent of the beans were contaminated with mold before they were processed. A further study found that nearly 50 percent of brewed coffees contain mold. Mold has become such a big problem in the coffee business that several governments, such as South Korea and Japan, have implemented regulations that ban coffee with a high amount of toxins. The United States and Canada, however, haven’t set any such limits so it’s likely that coffee sold in those countries carries a greater degree of mold. High levels of mold toxins can result in many serious health problems, including cardiomyopathy, cancer, hypertension, kidney disease and even brain damage. So pay careful attention to the coffee you buy. Cheaper coffee isn’t just made from lower quality beans – it’s also more likely to contain harmful toxins. And if you think drinking decaf will protect you, think again! It actually contains more mold than caffeinated coffee because caffeine naturally acts as an antifungal defense mechanism. It deters mold and other organisms from growing on beans. To avoid mold-exposure, it’s best to buy your coffee from shops that use their own roasters, if possible. You should also try to buy single-origin coffee instead of blended coffee. You don’t have to give up coffee entirely, however. If you drink it the right way, it’ll help make you bulletproof! Caffeine actually has many health benefits: it blocks inflammation to the brain and regulates your insulin sensitivity, which helps in weight loss. What’s more, you can intensify these benefits when you drink your morning cup of coffee by adding in some unsalted butter from grass-fed cows. Why would you do that? You get 3.4 times more antioxidants out of your coffee when you switch out your milk for butter. This is because milk has a negative effect on polyphenols, the good antioxidant found in coffee – it makes them less likely to be absorbed. Butter also contains butyric acid, which lowers inflammation and heals your gut. Still not convinced? A study on rats found that coffee combined with a high-fat diet led to decreases in body weight, fat and liver triglycerides. Another reason to add fat to your coffee is that it helps you reach ketosis, a metabolic state where the body burns fat for energy instead of sugar. Some people try to reach ketosis by avoiding carbs, but another trick you can use is to add C8 MCT oil, or medium-chain triglyceride oil (MCT oil), to your coffee. It’s made from coconut or palm oil and has 18 times more medium-chain triglycerides than regular coconut oil. Adding butter or MCT oil or even both to your coffee will help your body burn more fat as an energy source. The author studied this by experimenting with his own diet. He tested himself the day after eating a sushi dinner with two cups of rice and found that his blood ketone level was 0.1. A ketone level of 0.6 indicates ketosis. After drinking a cup of bulletproof coffee, however, his blood ketone level reached 0.7 within 30 minutes! People on low carb diets have to restrict their carb-intake for three days before they can reach the same level. MCT oil is so strong that it allows you to reach ketosis even after consuming carbs. Be careful though! Increase your MCT oil intake slowly, or you’ll risk making yourself sick. You can also become bulletproof by encouraging the growth of certain bacteria in your digestive tract. The microbes in your intestine – your gut biome – play an important role in your health and your diet has a big impact on them. Studies of mice have provided a great deal of insight into the ways our bodies gain and lose weight. Your weight isn’t just determined by the calories you consume or burn – it’s also affected by the bacteria in your gut. If bacteria from the guts of obese mice is inserted into thin mice, they overeat by ten percent and become more resistant to insulin. And like mice, heavy and thin humans also have very different gut bacteria. People who are naturally thin have more bacteria from the bacteroidetes phylum, also called thin people bacteria. You can generate more of it by eating foods that contain polyphenols. They’re found in brightly colored vegetables like peppers and carrots. Coffee is the richest source of polyphenols, however. Chocolate contains polyphenols too. You should also eat more resistant starches, like white rice and starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes, carrots and pumpkins. These starches can radically change your gut biome. These starches are “resistant” because they’re more resistant to digestion. Your body can’t break them down, so you can consume them without causing your insulin levels to rise, which would result in blood sugar problems. Because they can’t be broken down, resistant starches are still intact when they arrive in your colon. Several studies have found that helpful bacteria in the colon thrive on resistant starches and produce a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate when they’re digested. Butyrate is vital to a healthy gut and brain, which is another reason that butter is so good for you. Resistant starches are also found in less common foods, like green banana flour, plantain flour and potato starch. There’s a huge misconception that eating fat will make you gain weight, thanks to a man named Ancel Keys. In the 1950s, Keys argued that saturated fat causes heart disease. It was later revealed that he manipulated his research data to prove his theory correct, but the fallacy he spread is still alive and well today. Think of it this way: a high-performance car needs high-octane fuel to reach high speeds, because high-octane fuel stores more energy per gallon than low-octane fuel. Your body and brain work the same way. Instead of fuel, you need essential fats like omega-3s, which your body can’t produce on its own. Moreover, fat is crucial to our bodies: it’s in our brain and all of our cells and organs. Your body can’t function without high-quality fat. Fat is also the basis for myelin, which lines your nerves and allows electricity to flow efficiently in them. You literally think more quickly when you have more myelin, because it allows your nerves to transmit messages faster. Your body also burns fat more efficiently and forms more healthy cell membranes when you consume the right fat and avoid excess carbs. So what are the right kinds of fat? Mary Enig, a nutritionist, developed two ways to understand fats. The first is to examine the length of the fat molecule. The shorter the molecule, the rarer and more anti-inflammatory it is. That’s why the Bulletproof Diet suggests you consume more short- and medium-length fats like MCT oil. The second way to understand fat is to measure how stable it is. Stable fats like saturated fats oxidize more slowly because the molecules have less space for oxygen. Oxidation is the culprit behind inflammation and the effects of aging. Bulletproof oils and fats include MCT oil, ghee, cocoa butter, krill oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, sunflower lecithin and grass-fed butter. Like fats, different proteins also have different effects on your body – especially when it comes to your immune system, inflammation and muscle gain. Protein is vital because it maintains your muscle mass and bone density. In fact, protein is so critical to your survival that your body has powerful mechanisms that keep you from eating too much or too little of it. However, protein isn’t simple. A lot of people assume that all protein is healthy, and that assumption has allowed the processed-food industry to stuff their products with low-quality proteins like gluten and soy. In fact, in one study of the nutrients from high- and low-quality meat, grain-fed meat was found to be so low in omega-3 fats that it didn’t even qualify as a meaningful dietary source! So buy organic, grass-fed meat. It has more nutrients and fewer toxins than grain-fed or conventional meat. It also has more antioxidants, omega-3s, trace minerals and vitamins. You should also look for fat that appears more yellow – this color indicates that it’s full of nutrients. Grass-fed meat has been shown to have higher levels of carotenoid, which makes its fat a darker shade of yellow. Don’t assume that organic meat is just as good as grass-fed meat, however. Organic grain-fed meat is certainly better than conventional meat but it still contains mold toxins (from the food cattle eat) and hormones that contribute to obesity. Excess protein can also cause inflammation because it’s more difficult to digest than carbohydrates or fats. It’s harder for the body to turn proteins into glucose, which provides you with energy. That’s why you crave sweets sometimes: your liver needs glucose to process protein more efficiently. Bulletproof protein sources include wild fish with low concentrations of mercury (think haddock, anchovies, sardines and trout), grass-fed beef and lamb, pastured eggs, hydrolyzed collagen, gelatin, and clean whey concentrate. One of the keys to becoming bulletproof is to avoid foods that harm your body. So stay away from kryptonite foods, like processed meals and sugar. They provide little to no benefit and they make you fat, sluggish and weak. Processed food and other food that’s been chemically altered doesn’t satisfy your hunger. It actually makes you want to eat more. These foods don’t satiate you because they don’t have enough macronutrients – carbohydrates, proteins or fat. They might be tasty but that’s because of their chemical effect, not the food itself. Monosodium glutamate or MSG is the most common artificial flavor in processed foods. It was created in Japan during World War Two to make food taste better. People added it to low-quality or even spoiled foods. MSG causes your cells to send signals to each other so they become activated and overexcited. And when your cells die or get damaged, your brain sends signals requesting more energy, which triggers a headache, mood swings or craving for sweets – the fastest sources of energy. When you give in to your craving for sweets, you only harm your body more. Did you know that sugar and cocaine trigger the same reward centers in the brain? A large amount of sugar can decrease the dopamine receptors in your brain, which makes it harder for you to feel energy and pleasure when dopamine is released. This process also happens to drug addicts! Most people know what a “sugar crash” is but they don’t know where it comes from. A sugar crash doesn’t just throw off your focus and lower your energy – it lowers your blood sugar too. When you consume sugar, your blood sugar level rises until your body pumps in so much insulin that it decreases. Eliminating sugar from your diet is one of the best things you can do for your overall health. You can’t be afraid of hunger if you want to be bulletproof. Fasting can be very beneficial if you do it in a healthy way. There are a few ways to fast effectively. Intermittent fasting traditionally meant eating all your food in a shorter period of the day, usually within six to eight hours. In recent years it’s become quite popular, and for good reason: it helps fat loss, prevents cancer and builds your muscles. Alternate-day fasting, a form of intermittent fasting, has been proven to help prevent chronic diseases, reduce triglycerides, and cause significant improvements in several markers, such as LDL cholesterol. The downside of alternate-day fasting is that it requires you to skip breakfast and refrain from eating until after 2:00 p.m., which is difficult when you have to work. The author wanted to find an alternative to alternate-day fasting, which is how he developed the Bulletproof Intermittent Fasting – you start the day with a coffee and don’t need anything more till the afternoon. Why? Because the fat in bulletproof coffee is very satiating. It also triples the influence of a major physiological mechanism called mammalian target of rapamycin, or mTOR, which increases protein synthesis in your muscles and helps build them. As mentioned before, the Bulletproof Coffee diet also helps you go into ketosis, even if you’ve consumed carbs the day before. And you focus better and have higher energy when your body is running on ketones, because your blood sugar level remains steady during ketosis. So if you want something to go with your coffee and butter, it’s best to eat a combination of protein and fat, like poached eggs or smoked salmon and avocado. Eating fat and protein together prevents food cravings by giving your body extra energy to break proteins down into amino acids. Becoming bulletproof isn’t just about your diet, of course. Exercise is also crucial, although not all exercise is helpful. You aren’t necessarily healthy just because you can do sports. After all, some athletes drop dead during marathons! Extreme chronic cardio exercise actually strains the heart and damages its muscles. Walking and bike rides, on the other hand, aren’t challenging enough to be good exercise. Exercise is immensely beneficial when you do it right. Ultimately, exercise should be brief, intense, infrequent, safe and purposeful. If your exercise doesn’t meet these criteria, you aren’t maximizing its benefits. Weight training is the best form of exercise, as long as you keep each workout under 20 minutes. Do it until your muscles fail. Try the seated row and the chest press, for example. The more muscular you are, the more resilient you are to fatigue, diseases, pathogens and toxins. Typical cardio workouts like running or cycling aren’t the healthiest way to exercise. Try high-intensity interval training instead: run the fastest you can for 30 seconds, then rest for 90 seconds. Repeat for 15 minutes. Another benefit of high-intensity training is that your body will produce more of the performance anti-aging hormone HGH, which your body makes to keep you looking young. High-intensity workouts are actually the best way to produce HGH. Exercising more isn’t always good for you, however. In fact, overtraining can be very harmful. It’s critical that you give your body time to recover and rebuild muscle after you exercise, whether you’re weight lifting or doing high-intensity interval training. So rest from between two and ten days after each workout. Four to seven days is ideal. Finally, if you’re not experienced with free weights, start with machines first, because pushing yourself to the point of muscle fatigue will increase your risk of injury. Besides eating and exercising well, sleep is the last key to becoming bulletproof. A good night of sleep actually increases your ability to complete cognitive tasks by 50 percent! Sleep also makes your skin healthier, keeps you looking young, optimizes your insulin secretion, improves your athletic performance and encourages healthy cell division. You don’t have to sleep long hours to feel refreshed, either. In fact, studies have shown that healthy people don’t need more than six and a half hours of sleep a night. Sleep is a crucial part of the Bulletproof Diet because there’s a direct link between the sleep you get and the food you eat. When you boost your health and make yourself bulletproof, you can sleep less and still get all the benefits of a good night’s rest. One good way to improve your sleep is to eat fat at dinner. It can be grass-fed butter, animal fat, coconut oil or MCT oil. Fat is a long-burning fuel for your mind and body, so eating these fats before sleep gives you a stable stream of energy. It’s also a good idea to eat fish or krill oil at night, because they contain DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid. Studies have shown that fish oil containing DHA helps you produce serotonin, the neurotransmitter that promotes feelings of happiness and lowers the stress hormones that can interfere with sleep. Finally, eating raw honey before you go to bed also improves the quality of your sleep.  The key message in this book: The Bulletproof Diet isn’t just about losing weight. It’s about having a higher energy level and better focus too. If you consume the right fats and proteins, do high-intensity workouts, sleep right and fast intermittently, your body and mind will function as well as you look! Actionable advice: Prepare yourself for sleep. If you want to get the best quality sleep, avoid the following activities in the two hours before you go to bed: bright lights, violent movies and exercise. Go to bed in the right mental frame and you’ll get much more rest. What to read next: The Big Fat Surprise, by Nina Teicholz If you still find the idea of putting butter in your coffee off-putting, and you’re not convinced that fat belongs in a healthy diet, let journalist Nina Teichholz wipe away any lingering doubt. In The Big Fat Surprise, she challenges the notion that saturated fat is bad for your health and digs deeper into how this erroneous notion first took hold in America, in the end revealing it for what it really is: a big fat lie. So if you want to learn more about how to think about fat – including what you can learn from a Kenyan tribe about lowering your blood pressure – head over to the blinks for The Big Fat Surprise, by Nina Teichholz.

    "title": "Burnout",
    "author": "Emily Nagoski, PhD, Amelia Nagoski, DMA",
    "summary": "Tons of products are marketed to women as stress-relievers and ways to relax and feel better about themselves. But all the spa days, coloring books and bath bombs in the world aren’t going fix the real problems that women face on a daily basis. For problems like systemic sexism, unrealistic expectations and all the stress and anxiety they can produce, the solution is much more complicated. Fortunately, science has made some significant progress in understanding the ways in which we can deal with stress and exhaustion. Authors Emily and Amelia Nagoski have set out to provide women with the latest scientific data as a way of helping them understand why they’re experiencing burnout and giving them the tools to change. While we may not be able to topple the patriarchy today, we can fight it by becoming stronger, more informed and empowered. In these blinks, you’ll find the most effective methods for reducing daily stress; why the body mass index can’t be trusted; and how naming your inner madwoman can be helpful. Do you know that feeling when you’re completely and utterly exhausted, yet there’s something in the back of your mind saying you still haven’t done enough? If you’re a woman, chances are you’re all too familiar with this sense of being overwhelmed by life. When it feels like you’re constantly trying to meet your own demands and expectations and those of your job, family and friends, you can easily slip from benign tiredness to stress, anxiety and emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion happens after you’ve spent too much time caring too much. It is the first of three components identified by psychologist Herbert Freudenberger in 1975 in his clinical definition of burnout. Second is depersonalization, which is when you find your capacity for compassion, empathy and caring dwindles. The third component of burnout is a decreased sense of accomplishment. In other words, that feeling of “nothing I do matters.” All of these symptoms may sound familiar to you, but you may not know how they come about. For starters, how exactly can one exhaust one’s emotions? The answer? It happens when we get stuck. You can think of an emotional experience like a tunnel: it starts, then you’re in the middle of it, and then it ends. However, when you’re experiencing the same emotion all day and every day, there is no satisfactory end to that feeling. You’re stuck in the emotional tunnel with no relief. So it’s no wonder that people in jobs that require caring and helping, such as teaching and the medical profession, report very high levels of burnout. Some 20 to 30 percent of teachers admit to it, and for the medical profession, it’s upward of 52 percent. It may come as no surprise to hear that parental burnout is a fast-growing phenomenon. Fortunately, there are strategies to keep burnout at bay. And no, we’re not talking about bath bombs and coloring books; we’re talking about real, scientifically sound strategies to make sure you don’t get stuck in your emotions. There’s a very scientific reason for why we tend to get stuck in the emotion of stress, which also reveals just how dangerous it is to our health. Stress is essentially a neurological and physiological response triggered by a perceived threat. However, all the neurological and hormonal responses that accompany stress are designed to help you do one thing: run. Back when our stress-response system evolved, we needed to run for our lives a lot more often than we do now. So the stress cycle starts by releasing the hormone epinephrine to push blood into the muscles. As a result, your blood pressure and heart rate go up, your muscles tense and your breathing quickens. Meanwhile, to make sure you can haul-ass away from that theoretical charging rhino, other body functions like growth, digestion, reproduction and immunity are all slowed down. So if the emotion of stress never ends the danger is clear. Your body will end up with chronic high blood pressure and a corresponding higher risk of heart disease. And due to its compromised immune and digestive systems, your body won’t heal as quickly as it would normally and will be at higher risk of a number of digestion-related illnesses. All of this means one thing: you need to close the stress cycle as often as possible. Since stress is about running for your life, the natural happy ending to this cycle is that you arrive, safely and breathlessly, back home where you can celebrate with your friends. If you’re guessing that running or exercise in general is a great way to close out a stress cycle, you’d be right. After running, swimming, biking, dancing or engaging in some blood-pumping exercise for 20 to 60 minutes you’re likely to feel a shift in mood, your muscles will relax, and you will be able to take deeper breaths. You may even find yourself crying from the emotional release. But don’t worry, this is another good sign that you’ve closed off a stress cycle. However, it doesn’t have to be physically demanding exercise. Creative expression, be it painting, music, theater or sculpting, can also result in a satisfying closure to a stress cycle, as can positive social interactions that signal your return to safety. Affectionate moments like a more-than-just-polite hug or kiss are good, as is deep and genuine laughter or some quality time with a beloved pet. Working out an effective strategy against stress requires a good understanding of the difference between stress and stressors – the things that get you stressed – as well as which stressors are controllable and which are not. Let’s say you’re a middle school teacher. In this case, there’s no avoiding the daily stressors of having to complete endless amounts of paperwork and deal with annoying school administrators. These are things you can’t control – they come with the job. What you can do is schedule daily activities that close out the stress cycle, like going to the gym or practicing with your music or theater group. You can also manage these uncontrollable stressors through positive reappraisal. If you’re a natural optimist, you’ll probably find positive reappraisal easy since it’s a way of reframing a difficult situation to find positive opportunities. But make sure you don’t confuse this with “looking on the bright side” since positive reappraisal is always about fact and truth, not delusion. Controllable stressors can be managed with planful problem-solving. This is the name for analyzing a frustrating situation and coming up with a way to solve it or lessen frustration. If getting stuck in traffic is wearing on your last nerve, for example, you might apply some planful problem-solving and start using a good GPS system to tell you where the traffic is and provide you with alternate routes. The scientific reason for many of our frustrations lies in what’s known as the Monitor, which also goes by the more scientific names of discrepancy-reducing/-increasing feedback loop or criterion velocity. The Monitor is a mechanism of the brain that constantly assesses our current situation and our future plans while keeping a ratio of how much effort it’s going to take to get there along with how much progress we’re making. Generally speaking, the Monitor can be just as frustrated by problems that are out of your control as it can by problems you could have prevented. The important thing to know is that once you’re aware of the Monitor, you can start to work with it and lessen your frustrations using the tools we’ve just been considering. But these tools won’t work all the time. So it’s always useful to remember that difficult and frustrating tasks are often more rewarding than easy tasks. For example, if something is hard to read, studies show that you’re more likely to remember it. So, the next time you find yourself stuck in a difficult situation, remember that this is probably a better chance for personal growth than if it were easy. Let’s say you want to climb a mountain. If you think to yourself, “hey, this will be a piece of cake,” you will surely become frustrated at the first sign of struggle. But if you say, “I’m going to embark on the extremely challenging task of climbing this mountain,” then you’ll consider it normal and not frustrating at all when you find yourself struggling. This is an example of how your expectations determine your frustrations. By managing your expectations, you can also manage your frustrations. This approach can not only be used to tackle individual challenges but should also be applied to the world in general. Women are told all the time that they’re not being discriminated against and that if they’re feeling frustrated all they need is to do is drink some green smoothies and finish a coloring book, and they’ll feel great again. When this doesn’t happen, it’s easy for women to feel like it’s their fault – that something’s wrong with them. But this isn’t true. The fact is that the game is rigged, and we’re all still living in a patriarchy, despite what some might say. Understanding this will be far more effective than the greatest bath bomb ever invented. Science backs it up. In one study, people were given an impossible task. Naturally, when they couldn’t complete it and gave up, the participants felt miserable. But the moment they were told that the test was rigged, the negative emotions immediately vanished. Another persistent source of unrealistic expectations for women is the Bikini Industrial Complex (BIC), the name the authors use for the multi-billion-dollar conglomerate that pressures women to conform to a specific and unattainable body ideal. But here are the facts: even the concept of the body mass index (BMI), which has long been used to assess health, is rigged because the majority of the people who invented it worked for weight-loss clinics that wanted to keep women buying their services. Furthermore, a 2016 study published in The Lancet showed that people who were labeled clinically “obese” had a “lower health risk” than people labeled “underweight.” What’s more, people in the “overweight” category were found to be at a “lower risk” than those in the low end of the “healthy” category. BMI is bananas, and there’s absolutely no reason to believe that being skinny will make you healthier or live longer. This awareness can go a long way to making you feel better the next time you’re bombarded with ads from the BIC. If you’re familiar with the long line of Disney musicals, then you may have recognized that in each one, from Snow White to Beauty and the Beast, the main character will sing her “I want” song. In fact, you can gauge women’s progress in the United States through these songs. Snow White sings about wanting nothing more than a valiant prince, but Belle sings about wanting “adventure in the great wide somewhere.” Disney princesses haven’t always been the most woke, but they’ve always shown us one thing: the importance of knowing what you want. One of the most effective ways of persisting through stressful days is to know what you want and to have your life aligned with something bigger than yourself. In other words, you need to find your meaning. According to psychologist Martin Seligman, meaning is the secret to happiness. For others, it’s more like the secret to coping in a stressful world. Some understand meaning as spiritual or the mission of leaving a meaningful legacy behind. There’s no right or wrong when it comes to finding your calling. The only sure thing is that the more a person is aligned with a deeper sense of meaning, the more fully they will live their lives. But what about meaning in your own life? How do you find it? One thing that can get in the way is what the authors call Human Giver Syndrome. In her book Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny, philosopher Kate Manne describes two classes of people, human givers and human beings. Human givers are expected to devote their time, attention and bodies to human beings, who get to express their individuality. In many societies, women suffer from Human Giver Syndrome. They have been raised to fall into the human giver role rather than tend to their own needs or seek their own meaning. They are told that all women should want is to be pretty, happy, calm and devoted to the needs of others. Even Joseph Campbell, the author who helped popularize the concept of the hero’s journey, doesn’t believe in such a thing as a heroine’s journey. According to him, the woman is more of a place than a person, a destination for men to reach rather than an agent on her own journey. Human Giver Syndrome is a powerful enemy deeply rooted in female consciousness. But it is not reality. Don’t believe it and don’t punish yourself or let others punish you if you’ve “failed” to live up to the demands of Human Giver Syndrome. Here’s another popular myth in modern society: that life is a straight-line progression from being a dependent and needy child to being an independent adult. In fact, it’s pretty common to hear people say that a “healthy” adult is someone who can feel whole with or without other people. But here’s the reality: we aren’t going to function at our best when we’re constantly lonely and isolated or when we’re constantly surrounded by others. We need both. We need to move back and forth between feeling connected to others and feeling autonomous. We need connections for a lot of reasons, including emotional and medical support as well as getting information and education. Exactly how much connection someone needs varies from person to person. Introverts generally need less connection and more alone time than extroverts, who require more connection. But it’s not just quantity that matters. Quality does too. In a study of 70,000 heterosexual marriages, the couples in what were defined as bad quality relationships had poorer physical and mental health, shorter life spans and less satisfaction in life than those who were not. The opposite was true for those deemed to be in high-quality relationships. These people healed faster and took better care of themselves generally. Even people with chronic illnesses reported a higher quality of life as a result of a good relationship. What’s more, the quality of a relationship can be a better predictor of overall health than whether or not someone is a smoker. So, far from being a weakness or unhealthy, needing people makes you stronger. It can also give you a fresh perspective on who you are. When the authors’ friend Sophie fell in love with a man named Bernard, they were a little skeptical at first. He was older, had kids from a previous marriage and wasn’t the kind of guy for whom they’d necessarily expect Sophie to fall. But she explained that by seeing herself through Bernard’s eyes, she was able to love herself in new ways. This was the power of connection at work. Sometimes it takes a friend or partner to help you find compassion and love toward yourself. But this isn’t a weakness; it makes you stronger, and it’s part of being human. There’s an old and troubling saying that goes, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” People who believe this also tend to value our ability to push aside our needs and use sheer grit and determination to go ceaselessly from one task to the next. But this kind of life is downright dangerous. Not only will it lead to bad work but it can also take a toll on your health. Science tells us that what really makes us stronger is rest and sleep. If you want to do quality work, studies show that you should rest between tasks. This effectively erases the effects of fatigue from the previous task and allows you to spend twice as long on the next job as you otherwise would. It also leads to better work. How so? Well, when you rest, your brain isn’t being idle; it’s using a group of connected areas known as the default mode network. In this state, your brain is “wandering” and is able to assess current problems and find solutions in a way that isn’t possible when you’re actively involved in a task. So when you’re stuck on something, don’t just try to plow through it. Take a break and do some mindless task like folding your laundry for a little while. You might be surprised how often the solution will come to you. It’s also worth knowing that you can have an “active rest,” by just switching up your tasks from time to time. One of the authors, Emily Nagoski, wrote Burnout while simultaneously working on a novel. Since writing fiction and nonfiction is like exercising two different muscles, it effectively allowed her to rest and return to each task feeling refreshed. Likewise, the value of sleep should not be underestimated. When you’re sleeping, your body undergoes all kinds of bone, muscle and blood vessel repairs. This means that the benefits of any physical exercise you did during the day are really taking place while you sleep. The same is true for mental activity. Sleep is the time when all the new information you learned during the day can be consolidated and stored properly in memory. Our culture is obsessed with productivity. But life isn’t about squeezing out every last drop of energy until you’re empty as if you’re a tube of toothpaste. Life is about you and your something bigger, and you’ll be more likely to reach this something bigger when you are well-rested. In US actress Amy Poehler’s memoir Yes Please, she describes the nagging inner voice that has often told her she’s ugly and doesn’t deserve love. Those suffering from Human Giver Syndrome likely know this inner “madwoman,” as the authors call it, as it tends to show up whenever they think they’ve failed to live up to the calm, pretty, smiling, devoted-to-others woman they’re expected to be. Benign self-criticism can help you be more detail-oriented, but it can quickly slip into toxicity when it keeps you from doing anything. The madwoman is often a perfectionist, and she can convince you to give up when the first mistake appears or even not bother starting anything in the first place since perfection is impossible to begin with. But to grow strong and mighty you need to be able to take chances and feel free to learn from your mistakes along the way. This means you need to control your madwoman. One of the best strategies for doing so is to create a vivid image of your madwoman. You can even name her. The more you do this, the more you’ll be able to see yourself as being apart from this toxic voice and that you don’t need to listen to her admonishments. This can even lead to a friendly relationship that allows you to be your best. And once you have your self-critical voice under control, it becomes easier to practice self-compassion, which is another key step in growing stronger. Self-compassion can be difficult for some because it is essentially a form of healing. And when we’re healing, be it a broken arm or our relationship with ourselves, it leads to feelings of pain and vulnerability. But if you stick with it, the healing will finish, and you’ll find that the struggle has made you stronger and mightier for having persevered. With this strength, you can work toward joy. A lot of self-help books try to point you toward happiness, but in reality, this isn’t a good goal. Happiness will always be a fleeting moment, not a destination. What can be sustained is joy, by staying self-compassionate and regularly taking time to feel gratitude toward the people in your life and the good events that happen each day. The key message in these blinks: There are many complex and specific reasons why women are facing burnout these days. We don’t have regular ways of closing out the stress cycle brought on by our jobs and day-to-day lives. Fortunately, this can be done through exercise, creativity and affection. It’s also important to acknowledge that we live in an unbalanced society that discriminates against women and that the health and beauty industries place undue pressure on women. By recognizing these factors and striking back against our self-critical voices, we can begin to defeat the patriarchy and be our best selves through self-compassion and focusing on following our own dreams. Actionable advice: Hate exercising? Try these stationary stress relievers. If you have chronic pain or illness or simply loathe exercise with all your being, there are some alternatives. First is a deep-breathing exercise that involves taking slow deep breaths that contract your stomach at the end of the exhale. Start by breathing in for a slow five seconds, holding that breath for five seconds and then breathing out for a slow ten seconds. Pause for five seconds between each cycle and repeat three times. The second exercise is to tense every muscle in your body one by one for a slow count of ten seconds and then release. The beauty of these is that you can do them sitting, lying down or just about anywhere to close a stress cycle. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Chasing Excellence",
    "author": "A Story About Building the World’s Fittest Athletes",
    "summary": "It’s one thing to watch your favorite athletes on television and passionately yell your armchair coaching advice at the screen. But it’s hard to understand what the top athletes in the world have to go through just to have a chance at competing at professional levels. These blinks offer a window into the intense training approach that coach and author Ben Bergeron has used to train some of the strongest all-around athletes in the world. His athletes compete in the Crossfit Games, a yearly event with a range of categories that require a combination of gymnastic grace and brute-force strength. The winner actually gets the title of “Fittest on Earth.” So what do the fittest people in the world have, and what can you learn from them? You’ll find out why athletes who train at such absurd levels tend to share certain personality traits, and what being mentally fit really means. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how the equation E + R = O can give you a competitive advantage; why humble athletes will do better than egotistical ones; and how jumping into a freezing lake can prepare you for the worst. If you’ve been working for a while, you’ve probably noticed a few employees who are content to do the absolute bare minimum that’s being asked of them. They might not be bad at their job, per se, but they certainly don’t have any passion for it. And passion is the essential ingredient for being committed to your work, mastering a job and coming out ahead, even when the odds aren’t exactly in your favor. In his TED Talk, entitled “How Great Leaders Inspire Action,” Simon Sinek retells the story of the Wright brothers and their competitor, Samuel Pierpont Langley, in the race to build and fly the first airplane. What many forget is that Langley had far more support and resources at his disposal but what he didn’t have was the kind of passion that was fueling the Wright brothers. So, while Langley was unwilling to personally test his planes, the brothers were committed to building and piloting their machines, which eventually gave them the winning edge. And nobody remembers Langley anymore. So, a passionate commitment can be critical, but the competitive advantage also goes to those who have the right habits. This is particularly the case for practicing, each and every day, no matter what. In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell points to studies that show how the best violinists are the ones who spent more time playing their instrument. You’ve probably heard of the the famous 10,000 Hour Rule. That’s how much you have to practice before you can master a skill. However, to achieve excellence, you've got to do more than just log the hours. What sets the great performers apart is deliberate practice, which involves pushing yourself past the normal limits, beyond your comfort zone and to new levels of greatness. To make sure you’re practicing deliberately, ask yourself, “Am I giving this task my absolute attention?” “Am I using this time to its full potential?” and “What do I need to practice and improve at this stage?” It’s important to remember, especially when starting out, that any discomfort you may be putting yourself through will pay off in the long run. As the saying goes: no pain, no gain. Waking up at 5 a.m. to go for a run may be the last thing you want to do, but this is the level of commitment that will lead you across the finish line first. One of the more difficult lessons in life is learning how to focus your energy on the things you can control and not worry so much about the things you can’t. This holds true for athletes as well. If you want to perform at your best, you must accept that certain things are out of your control. When he was coaching two athletes –  Katrín Davíðsdóttir and Mat Fraser – who were about to start the 2015 Crossfit Games, the author asked them to write a list of everything that could possibly go wrong during the competition. Then, he separated the potential problems into two categories: things they could control and things they couldn’t control. Now, he could immediately cross off every item in the latter category – like event scheduling and other external conditions – to help prevent his athletes from wasting their energy worrying about them. Instead, they could stay focused on the potential problems they could control, like watching their nutrition and planning ways to be at their peak-performance level for each event. But making plans and sticking to them are two different matters. Unfortunately, Fraser couldn’t stop thinking about Ben Smith, his rival in the stand-up push-up event. So instead of concentrating on his own performance and being in peak physical and mental condition, Fraser focused on Smith’s performance and lost the event. This brings us to another common problem facing athletes: knowing when to “shut the door” and not let a mistake or defeat linger in your mind. This is where mindfulness can come in handy for an athlete. The author coaches his athletes to spend a maximum of five minutes considering what has happened and then spend the next ten minutes focusing on their breathing and centering themselves on being present. This way they can quickly let go of any negativity. For example, Katrín Davíðsdóttir once made a mistake during the D-ball event, which involves picking up and throwing a heavy ball filled with sand. In one attempt, Davíðsdóttir dropped the ball before making a rep. Though she was upset with herself, she did the right thing by lingering on the mistake for only five minutes before refocusing on the next event. Remember, it’s important to recognize your mistake so you can avoid repeating it, but you have to quickly let it go so that it won’t affect your next performance. If you’ve ever spent time around a world-class athlete, you’ll likely notice that everything about them, from the way they walk to the way they talk, radiates confidence. And like everything else an athlete can use to their advantage, confidence is something that comes through training and hard work. While many people believe that you can only gain confidence by winning competitions and racking up accomplishments, this isn’t true. Confidence comes by learning how to react positively to an outcome, whether you came in first or last. The coach of the Ohio State football team, Urban Meyer, has a formula that states: Event + Response = Outcome, or E + R = O for short. In other words, any athlete’s response to a given situation plays a significant role in the outcome. Plus, the athlete’s reaction is the only factor that she has control over. So, no matter what the outcome is, she can always have confidence in knowing she did all she could do, so long as she gave her best possible response. Once you understand the simplicity of this equation you’ll find it easier to be humble about the results. By being humble about your performance, you’ll stay open to constructive comments and opinions about possible flaws and how you can improve. In the running event of the 2015 Crossfit Games, Mat Fraser nearly came in last place. But thanks to his humble and open attitude, he took these results in a positive way and immediately began improving this part of his game. In fact, knowing that high schoolers could outrun him, he used these teenagers as running partners in his training program. This humility paid off handsomely a year later when he confidently grabbed first place in the event in the 2016 Crossfit Games. Another method the author uses for getting good results is known as double-loop learning. Single loop learning is when an athlete focuses solely on the external reasons for why they got the results they did. So double-loop learning factors in both the external and the internal reasons, and it often leads to getting faster answers to your problems. When Mat Fraser was close to last in his 2015 run, double-loop learning didn’t limit the results to the conditions of the course or the quality of his opponents. While these external factors played a role, the internal factor of how much Fraser needed to improve was also clear. There are a lot of self-help gurus who preach the benefits of positivity and how it can improve your life. And sure enough, the author has also found that a positive attitude can work wonders for reaching goals and getting the best possible results. First of all, when compared to a negative attitude, positivity provides a much stronger work ethic. It’s very natural for our minds to obsess about a problem and to be hard on ourselves when something doesn’t turn out the way we’d hoped. But with some practice, you can change this response and adopt a positive outlook. In a study by Stanford University professor Arnold Zwicky, we can see how the mind tends to pick up on the sort of results we’re already contemplating – so if we’re thinking negative thoughts, we’ll see negative results and vice versa. Zwicky calls this the frequency illusion. You might have already experienced this in your day-to-day life. For example, if you start thinking about buying a new Jeep Grand Cherokee, you’ll start noticing these Jeeps everywhere and think they suddenly popped up overnight, when in fact it’s just because you started thinking about them. The same goes for positivity. The more positive thoughts you have, the more positive results you’ll see in your performance, which will help motivate you and keep you improving. It can also help when the conditions of an event throw you a curveball: During one of the Crossfit Games, all the athletes experienced a three-hour flight delay, and most were angry since it meant they wouldn’t get to their hotel rooms until after midnight, even though the competition was taking place the next day. But Katrín Davíðsdóttir remained positive and slept happily in the airport, on the plane and eventually in her hotel room. The next day, while some felt tired and far from peak condition, Davíðsdóttir remained confident and well-rested. Feeling positive also keeps you focused on what matters most: it’s not how many medals or trophies you win, it’s always about how you can get better. When Davíðsdóttir started being coached by the author, she relocated from Iceland to Boston and never once complained or wasted time worrying. Every day, she concentrated on giving her best effort and on how she could improve her training, nutrition, sleep and recovery. If you want to be well-prepared for an event, you shouldn’t only be preparing for the best – great athletes are also prepared for the worst. One of the best ways to prepare for adversity is to add difficult obstacles to your training. You’ve probably heard the saying, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” and there is some truth to this philosophy. In the world of psychology, this is referred to as adversarial growth – the belief that challenges in life are a significant driver behind personal growth. In athletics, there’s a method called the “overload principle,” which is when a person’s body is pushed to the limit. A common way to use this principle is to keep adding weights to your body during training, as this constantly requires you to adjust and exert more strength. The author used this principle when training Katrín Davíðsdóttir and Mat Fraser by having them swim in water that was far colder than normal. At first, Davíðsdóttir refused to dive in, thinking it was ridiculous and unnecessary. But eventually the author convinced her, and it didn’t take long before she was sensing the competitive advantage that these harsh conditions could provide. Even when jellyfish started to appear in the waters, Davíðsdóttir quickly followed her coach’s orders to jump back in for a second round. By being familiar with non-ideal conditions and situations that could go wrong, as well the best conditions, you’ll be far better prepared to handle the pressure of a competition. There’s going to be very little that can surprise you. One of the most challenging events at the Crossfit Games is the Pegboard Ascents. It is essentially a wall full of holes that the athletes must scale by using only their upper body strength as they insert climbing pegs one by one for their hands. Davíðsdóttir’s competitors were quite aggressive in this event, trying to be as fast as possible. But each one eventually fell. Davíðsdóttir, well-trained in understanding the potential pitfalls and knowing that steady concentration can be better than speed, slowly climbed the wall and reached greater heights than her competitors. Most people have a certain comfort level, and when they’re pushed to that limit their instinctual response is to run for the hills. For the most part, it’s perfectly acceptable to be good at something and maintain a consistent quality. But to go from ordinary to extraordinary, one must have the kind of grit that enables you to rise to a challenge and keep pressing on and getting better and better. Grit is the quality that pushes you to keep going on, even when you’re having a terrible day, and everyone in the world seems to be against you. It’s refusing to give up without a fight and finding that extra bit of effort within you, even when you think you’ve been drained dry. In the 2013 Crossfit Northeast Regionals, Mat Fraser got savagely beaten in the rowing event. While most people were clocking in at around 1:40, Fraser was taking up the rear with 1:50. So Mat did what he needed to do: when he got back to training, he showed his true grit by rowing 4,000 to 5,000 meters every day, which is a tremendous amount, even by professional rowing standards. Mat was sore as hell after this effort, but he certainly wasn’t going to row another 1:50. Grit combines with the other qualities we’ve covered to create competitive excellence. When you have competitive excellence, you’re guaranteed to still put in your best effort even when you’re having a bad day or your team is falling apart. Regardless of the circumstances, you will give 100 percent. The same goes for when you’re far ahead of the pack: In the 2016 Crossfit Games, Fraser was ahead of his closest competitor by 195 points, with only two events left. He could have spent the rest of the competition on autopilot and still won, but thanks to his competitive excellence, Fraser still gave everything he had to those final two events, just like he did in the first events when his fate was far from sealed. Success for Fraser isn’t about a trophy; it’s about always doing your best and pushing yourself to the very limits of your capabilities. In other words, it’s about having competitive excellence. The key message in this book: Athletic excellence isn’t an elusive condition that only exists in people with the right DNA or natural talent. Anyone can achieve this excellence, as long as they have the passion, commitment and willingness to grow in more than just physical strength. If you want to master a discipline, you must develop your mental fortitude and be willing to push yourself far beyond normal limits. Without this, you’ll never reach the highest peaks. Actionable advice: Try to think of improvement as getting better by 1 percent every day. This kind of incremental improvement is called “aggregation of marginal gains” – because small but meaningful buildup is a powerful tool. By the end of the year, you can make 100 percent improvements! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Clean",
    "author": "Alejandro Junger and Amely Greeven",
    "summary": "There’s a good chance that you’re having a coffee to keep awake while reading this. Perhaps you’re even on your third one. Now, what if you could reap the energizing benefits of coffee by removing toxins from – not adding them to – your body (because the sad story is that, yes, caffeine is a toxin). This is what these blinks will offer you: a way to achieve good health by cleansing your system. You’ll learn about the Clean Program, which teaches you how to change your lifestyle so that your body can detoxify and heal itself from the wear and tear of everyday life. And you’ll learn about the different toxins you expose yourself to daily, as well as how to go into a deep cleansing mode that expels these poisonous substances from your body. From the ideal diet to an array of exercises, you’ll get the tools you need to start cleaning up your life. You’ll also learn that most cleaners aren’t actually all that clean; how many times a day you’d be going to the toilet if your diet was cleaner; and what radical reorientation the Clean Program requires. If you’re not feeling well, you might go to the drugstore to get some meds. Or if it’s a really heavy cold, you might head to the doctor and pick up a prescription for something stronger. But what if the problem is less straightforward than a cold or flu? What if the problem has to do with how your body is functioning? Unfortunately, these days there’s an abundance of unnatural environmental and dietary toxins that are damaging your body’s ability to properly function and heal. At virtually every turn, we’re bombarded with pesticides on our food and dangerous chemical cocktails in our cleaning products. While companies have been quickly manufacturing stronger chemicals to be used for an increasing range of purposes, our bodies haven’t had the time to develop a resistance to these toxins. In just the last century alone, we’ve dramatically changed the way we eat and live, and it’s taken a toll on our body’s defense systems. Toxicity comes with its fair share of symptoms, such as recurring tiredness and bloating, but these are commonly written off by doctors as signs of our body’s normal wear and tear. Most doctors will hesitate to do anything unless symptoms are severe, and in those cases their advice will be to ingest powerful drugs that add to the toxic residue in your body. But it doesn’t have to be this way. There are viable alternatives. Throughout the ages, healers have practiced regular deep-clean detoxes. In particular, Indian and Chinese cultures have long been proponents of detoxes for both physical and mental well-being. But in the West, today’s mainstream medical community has turned their attention away from these traditional practices and toward molecular manipulation. You don’t need a doctor to start a detox program and reactivate your body’s ability to heal and regenerate. But before we get into the process, let’s take a closer look at the toxins you need to target. At his cardiology clinic, in New York, the author, Dr. Alejandro Junger, noticed a worrying trend: many patients were physically, mentally and emotionally off-balance. Symptoms of bloating, tiredness, sneezing and moodiness were common, and it made Dr. Junger wonder whether it was all due to environmental toxins. Everyone on the planet today is infected with hundreds of toxic chemicals that have only come into existence during the twentieth century. But to really understand how these toxins reach us, it helps to consider the four different environments your body comes into contact with every day. Dr. Junger refers to these as our four layers of skin. The first layer is our body’s natural defense – our actual skin. The toxins that enter through this layer include chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries, such as the aluminum that’s found in many deodorants. When we rub chemicals onto our skin, we force toxins into our bloodstream through the very pores that are designed to keep them out! Our second skin is our clothes. These often contain dyes, perfumes and residue from chemical cleaning products. Fabrics are more heavily treated with pesticides than our foods. In fact, 25 percent of the world’s pesticides are used on cotton. Not only that, perchloroethylene is a common ingredient in dry cleaning that has been found to cause liver, kidney and neurological damage. Our third skin is our indoor environment, including our workplace and home. Now, you might think your indoor space is cleaner than the outdoors, but the Environmental Protection Agency has actually suggested otherwise due to the toxic emissions from paint, insulation materials and your furniture. Have you ever noticed the strong smell of a new shower curtain? That’s likely from PVC plastic, which is one of the most toxic goods on the market. The fourth and final skin is the outside world. While you might go outside for some “fresh air,” research shows that even a few hours’ exposure to heavy air pollution can raise the risk of heart attack. Power lines, mobile phones and computers all emit radiation that has been linked to the same symptoms caused by chemical toxins. Who among us doesn’t love to gather around a grill on a weekend afternoon to enjoy some barbecued meat or veg? History shows that food has always had the power to bring people together, but the unhealthiness of much of that food is a relatively recent development. Modern processed foods, in particular, are downright poisonous, all in the name of “safety” and turning a profit through convenience and making the food look as good as possible. Take spinach, for example: to kill bacteria, the healthy green vegetable is shot with X-rays that also destroy much of its nutrients. Food is also given unnatural, hydrogenated fats and oils so that it’ll last longer on the shelf, but consuming these fats damages your body’s cells by altering key proteins that control cellular growth. Even the tap water is dangerous these days. The fluoride that’s added to the water is meant to strengthen our teeth, but recent studies have linked fluoride to thyroid and kidney disease as well as neurological problems that can affect a person’s IQ. Packaging is a concern as well, as plastic chemical compounds called phthalates can enter foods and build up in our bodies. Over time, phthalates can interfere with hormones and increase the risk for breast, thyroid and prostate cancer. Thankfully, there are better ways to eat than indulging in processed foods, and you can start by looking toward your local food sources and eating what’s in season. If you look at the areas of the world with the highest life expectancies, you’ll notice a trend in their eating habits. In one mountain village in Sardinia, for example, an impressive percentage of people reach 100 years of age. People in this village and others like it eat a diet high in raw, seasonal fruits and vegetables, which are grown without the aid of chemicals. These people are in no hurry, either. They take their time to prepare their food and enjoy the ritual of cooking. For them, it’s a pleasure, not a chore, and they even chew their food ten times longer than the average city dweller. When toxic molecules enter a body, they don’t just affect one area; they cause a chain reaction that spreads far and wide. For instance, consider amma, the substance that, according to the Ayurvedic tradition of medicine in India, accumulates after prolonged exposure to toxins. A buildup of amma is a good warning sign that a detox is in order. Ayurvedic tradition believes in the importance of eating the right foods to keep your body in a healthy balance. When this balance is lost, that’s when disease will arise. So it’s important to notice amma when it appears, which you can do by testing the elasticity of your face. When you pinch your face and tug on the skin, it should snap right back into place. But if you notice your face looking puffy, with pimples, visible pores, dark circles under the eyes and small depressions like the skin of an orange – this is a sign of amma and it should not be ignored. You might think sagging skin is a normal sign of aging, but if you look at the 100-year-olds in those healthy communities, most of them have been able to maintain taut skin throughout their lives. But toxic buildup doesn’t just affect our appearance, either. Another symptom to beware of is chronic constipation. Unsurprisingly, constipation is one of the biggest health complaints in Western medicine. For proof, you need only consider the size of the market for laxatives. But the reality is worse than you think, since what is considered normal is itself unnatural. A healthy pattern is to use the toilet after every meal. But since our diet is so heavy on difficult-to-digest foods like wheat and dairy, our digestive system gets clogged up and the toxins remain in our body. All of this can cause painful constipation. We can easily imagine what it’s like for an external cut on our skin to heal. The skin cells around the cut divide and start covering up the area until it’s completely healed over. It’s good to keep this in mind and apply it to the healing that needs to take place inside your body. This is what the Clean Program does – it cleans out the wounds in your body so that it can start the healing process. Here’s what happens during the 21-Day Clean Program: The first rule is to change your diet and eat less difficult-to-digest food, which means less wheat and dairy, fewer solid foods and more juices. This will give your body more energy to heal and detoxify. The next rule is to maintain a daily schedule that contains 12 straight hours when you consume nothing at all. This ensures that your body can enter detoxification mode, which happens around eight hours after you’ve finished eating your last meal, and complete detoxification, which takes an additional four hours. Before you start these 21 days, you also need to remove all the toxins from your living environment. And if you really want the best possible results, you must prepare your mind, as well as a good schedule and your kitchen. You should be aware that the first three days will be the toughest, so you’ll need to be motivated. Keep in mind how the average person looks – not too good, right? Indeed, half of all Americans can now expect to get cancer in their lifetime. If you want to be in the half that doesn’t, you need to take action. For your schedule, plan to start your 21 days when there aren’t any other big changes going on in your life. So don’t start this if you’re starting a new job, moving into a new place or going through a breakup. Finally, make sure your kitchen is set up with these three essentials: a water filtration system, a high-speed blender and a powerful juicer. Don’t expect the Clean Program to be easy. To successfully get through these three weeks, you’re going to need to rethink your relationship to food and hunger and recalibrate your eating habits. During the Clean Program, each of the 21 days will consist of one solid meal and two liquid meals, such as a shake, juice or soup. The liquid meals will cover breakfast and dinner; you’ll have the solid meal for lunch. This way, you’ll have more energy overnight during the consecutive 12 hours of fasting. For all three meals, there are Clean Program recipes. For the liquid meals, there are choices like a mango coconut milkshake, which contains nutrients that are easy to absorb and will change your metabolism, so that you’ll feel less hungry. Chances are, at some time you’ll feel the urge to snack between meals. But before you give in to temptation, ask yourself if you’re really hungry or are merely looking to food as a comfort or distraction from something else. If it’s real hunger, snack on raw, fresh foods like vegetables, nuts or green smoothies, and stay away from simple carbohydrates like rice cakes. To get the program’s maximum benefits, add daily supplements like fiber, probiotics and antimicrobials. Natural fiber supplements that contain flax seeds or psyllium husks will bind to toxins in your intestines and help remove them before they can get reabsorbed. And there are hundreds of different species of helpful intestinal bacteria that can be reintroduced with probiotic supplements. The best supplements are ones that contain a minimum of 15 billion organisms per dose. Meanwhile, antimicrobials such as oregano oil or garlic cloves will help kill any bad bacteria. In the last blink, we’ll take a look at some more helpful ways you can make the most of your program. There are a number of complementary activities you can do to support yourself during the Clean Program, and while some are simple, none are unimportant. For example, make sure you get enough sleep, and don’t forget to stretch, relax and be kind to yourself during the 21 days. There are also important activities that can enhance the removal of toxins from your body. One of the most effective is to undergo colonic hydrotherapy. This requires the assistance of a specially trained therapist who pumps low-pressure streams of water into the colon to aid the removal of waste. You can also increase the amount of toxins released through your sweat by using saunas. Infrared saunas are especially effective as they involve powerful heat waves that activate the fat molecules deep under the skin’s surface so that more toxins are released. Breathing exercises can also assist your body in getting rid of carbon dioxide and reducing the acidity in your blood. A good exercise is to concentrate on taking full, deep breaths while picturing your mind and nervous system being swept clean with each breath. One of the best ways to enhance all these methods is to stay physically active with regular exercise during the Clean Program. But remember: don’t overdo it. Any form of exercise can be great for promoting regular bowel movements, getting a healthy sweat going and inducing deep breaths. However, there are certain exercises that really take the detoxification process to the next level. Jumping, skipping and trampoline exercises promote better lymph circulation, which is particularly useful since lymph fluids carry toxins through the lymph nodes, which filter out damaged cells and bacteria. But pay attention to your energy levels, which can get depleted during the Clean Program, especially during the first week. Avoid intense training during these early days and whenever you’re feeling weak. It’s best to simply spend at least twenty minutes every day being mobile and active, whether it’s stretching, dancing or walking. So now you have the basic information necessary to achieve a healthier body and mind. The next step is for you to commit yourself to the program. The key message in this book: Modern society in the Western world is overrun with obesity, depression, constipation and heart disease, all of which are made worse by the dietary and environmental toxins that can be found all around us. The Clean Program is designed to help you to detox so that your body and mind will have a fighting chance to heal and rejuvenate. Actionable advice: Stay away from chemical cosmetics. Don’t use any cosmetics that you would be afraid to get in your mouth. By rubbing something on your skin, you’re introducing it into your bloodstream in much the same way as you would by eating it. So if it contains nasty, unsafe chemicals, don’t put it on your body! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Comfortably Unaware",
    "author": "Dr. Richard A. Oppenlander",
    "summary": "Everyone’s talking about it. Global warming. Natural resources are exploited; our planet is suffering. We are over-harvesting timber from our forests, pouring greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and polluting rivers and oceans. These blinks provide you with great insights into the current state of the earth. But it’s not the familiar story about the evils of burning fossil fuels. There’s more to global environmental depletion than that. We need to take a close look at the very foods we eat. It’s a matter of our food culture, and how the raising of animals has multiple negative effects on our planet. Read on and you may never eat steak again. In these blinks, you’ll learn which greenhouse gases are the most harmful; why the clearing of forests impacts our hope of curing cancer; and why our use of the oceans is unsustainable. Did Al Gore’s book on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth, inspire you to use less water and electricity and start taking public transportation? If so, that’s great, but unfortunately, you’ve only tackled part of the problem. If we really want to stop global warming we have to start caring more about what we eat, especially when it comes to meat, fish and dairy. Global warming is triggered by an increase in the earth’s temperature as a result of humans releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases are mostly made up of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Between 1750 and 2006, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose 35 percent. And in just the last 15 years, methane has increased by 145 percent. This is more troubling since methane is far more powerful than carbon dioxide, having 23 times the impact on global warming. So what is causing this rise in methane? It is primarily related to the increase in livestock. Approximately 40 percent of methane generated by human activity comes from raising livestock. And to make matters worse, livestock also accounts for 65 percent of the nitrous oxide we generate – a gas that has 310 times more of an impact on global warming than carbon dioxide! But global warming is only one piece of a larger problem known as global depletion: the point at which the earth’s renewable and non-renewable resources start to disappear. But even renewable resources, such as trees, can take hundreds of years to mature in great enough numbers for us to use them again. And unfortunately, at the rate we are using our natural resources, we’re not giving nature the time it needs to restore itself. In the blinks that follow, we’ll see how the food industry is pushing us to global depletion. No one likes to stop and think about what kind of environmental impact a cheeseburger might have on the planet. But before you order your next Big Mac, consider the following. For starters, in order to raise livestock we’ve wiped out huge amounts of rainforest. A study conducted by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization shows that we eat over 70 billion animals each year. And to raise all those animals we need vast amounts of resources including water, land, fossil fuels and more food to feed them. The land clearances required by the meat industry are a prominent cause of global depletion. We’ve forever lost over 70 percent of the Amazon rainforest to cattle ranching. And each year since the 1970s we’ve been losing an additional 34 million acres. Just 50 years ago, rainforests made up 15 percent of our planet; today that number has dropped to less than 2 percent. If you don’t think rainforests are worthy of concern, think about them as the earth’s lungs. One-fifth of the planet’s oxygen supply comes from rainforests and their ability to absorb millions of tons of carbon dioxide and produce oxygen in return. This means that the more acres of rainforest we lose, the more difficult it is for Earth to breathe. But it’s not just oxygen we lose by cutting down rainforests, we also lose some of the 5 million different species of plants and animals that are essential to humans. For example, the rainforests are home to over 2,000 plants that contain cancer-fighting properties, such as vincristine. And according to Leslie Taylor’s book, The Healing Power of Rainforest Herbs, 70 percent of all medications that fight cancer originate in rainforests. So when scientists estimate that we lose 100 different species of plants every day from deforestation, it raises the question: How many health benefits are we also losing? Humans will be doing themselves a favor by protecting the rainforests rather than destroying them for livestock. If we stopped devoting so much land to raising animals for food, we could feed everyone on the planet. For example, the United States sets aside 70 percent of the grain it grows to feed livestock. Meanwhile, according to the World Hunger Organization, 6 million children died of starvation in 2009. Enough grain is grown around the world to put an end to world hunger, but even in dire situations, the food goes to livestock. Think about it: In 1986 there was a food shortage in Ethiopia that received worldwide media coverage and brought much-needed attention to the country. During this time, however, Ethiopia was actually producing large amounts of grains like rapeseed and linseed, but it was all being exported to European nations to raise meat and dairy animals! On top of all this, raising livestock depletes our available land and can even severely damage it. In the United States, approximately 80 percent of available land is used for agriculture that directly or indirectly supports raising livestock. And overgrazing by livestock destroys topsoil, which leads to erosion and eventually turns fertile land into desert. Some 500 million Africans have seen their agriculture, biodiversity, and water cycle severely damaged by desertification mainly caused by livestock. It comes down to simple economics: supply and demand. The more we demand animals for food, the more we will deplete our resources. So far we’ve seen how raising 70 billion livestock every year requires huge amounts of land and food. But those 70 billion animals also deplete our fresh water supply. Every day they require far more water than we do in order to survive. For instance, a human requires 6 to 8 ounces of water a day to stay hydrated, while one pig needs 21 gallons of water, and a cow 30. That means it takes 5,000 gallons of water to produce one pound of meat. To put this in perspective, for one pound of vegetables, fruit, soybeans or grain, we only need 20 to 60 gallons of water. So if you really want to conserve water, keep in mind that by not eating a pound of beef you actually save more water than you would by not showering for an entire year! And it’s not just the animals that are drinking all the water – the grains being used to feed those animals also require large amounts. Iowa Beef Processors is a US slaughterhouse that kills 1.5 million cattle every year. This slaughterhouse alone uses 600 million gallons of water per year to grow the grain needed to feed the cattle. It’s important to remember that fresh drinking water is not a limitless resource nor quickly renewable. Since we only have access to 2.5 percent of Earth’s water, with 70 percent out of reach in the form of glaciers or snow, the excessive amounts being used for agriculture are rapidly draining our resources. This means that our current misuse of water is not sustainable in the long term. If we continue using water at this rate, it is estimated that we will run out of supplies by 2020. And once we exhaust our freshwater resources, they’re gone forever. Unfortunately, reducing our meat intake isn’t the only step that needs to be taken. If we want to become environmentally conscious, we also need to look at the damage our seafood consumption is doing to the oceans. Overfishing is rampant around the world and far from sustainable. This is largely because fishing practices are not well regulated. For example, deep-sea fishing is destroying a large portion of marine life. The bottom of the oceans contain continental slopes and seamounts – underwater mountains that are home to the majority of sea life. This includes corals, sponge beds and thousands of other species. Modern fishing industry vessels aim directly for these deep-sea species with a practice that is called heavy bottom trawling: the bottom of a large net drags along the seabed, disturbing and even destroying ecosystems that can take centuries to repair. In fact, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations states that 70 percent of all fish species are either completely depleted or overfished. Over a thousand other species are endangered. In addition to this, the gigantic net that is used in heavy bottom trawling needlessly traps and kills other sea creatures. According to the United Nations, in 2009, the total number of sea creatures caught far exceeded the 106 million tons of fish that was reported. The worst example is shrimp fishing: for every pound of shrimp captured, more than 20 pounds of other sea life, including fish, birds and dolphins are killed and discarded. Finally, when we consider the damage that our demand for animal products does to the planet, we must also look at the amount of worldwide pollution it contributes. Raising livestock greatly pollutes our global water supply. In US factory farms alone, livestock produce over 5 million pounds of excrement per minute. That’s 130 times the amount the entire US human population produces. All this excrement travels through the sewage, ending up in the planet’s water system. And that excrement inevitably includes all the antibiotics, pesticides, hormones and various other chemicals that are used to raise and grow livestock. In fact, 33 percent of the poisonous phosphorus and nitrogen found in freshwater originates from livestock. This pollution is also affecting the air we breathe. When measured in units equivalent to carbon dioxide, 20 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock, whereas only 13 percent comes from global transportation. This is in addition to the methane, nitrous oxide, ammonia and carbon that is released into the air through the flatulence, urine and manure of livestock. Pollution also results from the farming of fish. Huge amounts of feces and other waste get released into the oceans from the small enclosures that farmers use to raise fish. These feces are also contaminated by the use of fishmeal and fish oil in aquafarming. This process increases cancer-causing substances like dioxins, which get passed on to other fish along the food chain. In 2001, a study revealed that in British Columbia alone, one year of salmon farming produced the same amount of nitrogen as the annual untreated sewage of 682,000 people. And due to the high amount of disease and parasites in overcrowded fish farms, the use of antibiotics, pesticides and copper presents yet another danger to our health. The key message in this book: What we choose to eat greatly affects our planet. By demanding to eat meat, dairy and fish, we are contributing to world hunger, water scarcity, poor land management, pollution and even climate change. Our lifestyles and food industry operates are not sustainable, and the only way to change that is to become more environmentally conscious and careful about what we eat. Got feedback?

    "title": "Common Sense Pregnancy",
    "author": "Jeanne Faulkner",
    "summary": "Are you pregnant or the partner of someone who is? If so, you probably have a lot of questions. You might wonder when you’re supposed to see a doctor, what you’re supposed to eat or whether you should choose a midwife or a doula. These are all valid and important questions. These blinks are here to help. Not only will they give you the answers to these questions but also guide you through many other dos and don’ts of pregnancy. In these blinks, you’ll learn how much nausea is too much nausea; if and when labor induction might be relevant; and which challenges you might encounter after giving birth. Finding out that you’re pregnant can lead to a number of overwhelming thoughts. And your first reaction to learning you’re pregnant might be to get in touch with your doctor. But don’t be surprised or concerned if your doctor sets an appointment for six to eight weeks down the line. While it’s natural to be concerned, there’s no need to rush yourself to a doctor the minute you become pregnant. The best thing you can do is be patient and make the most of these first few weeks. Since it’s too early for ultrasounds or screening exams, there isn’t much for a doctor to do at this stage. But there are some simple things you can do to help ensure a healthy pregnancy. Prenatal vitamins are a good source of folic acid and iron, which are important at this stage. And you can also use this time to select a health-care specialist that you’d like to have by your side throughout your pregnancy. It’s best to choose someone you’re absolutely comfortable with. There are also important signs you should not ignore – including bleeding or severe nausea – which do require an early doctor’s appointment. Some pregnant women can suffer from a case of severe nausea called hyperemesis gravidarum, which requires medication and rehydration. Another symptom to be aware of is vaginal bleeding. This is known as spotting, and 25 percent of pregnant women experience it during the first trimester (that is, within the first 13 weeks). If the spotting is light, be calm and see what happens. If the spotting persists or becomes stronger, or if you’re not certain whether it’s getting stronger, now is definitely the time to call your doctor, since it could be the sign of a miscarriage. A doctor will let you know what the next step should be. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how to find a pregnancy specialist who can make the next nine months a little easier. If you’re planning on giving birth in a hospital, you might be in for a surprise. For, when the time comes, you’ll probably find yourself surrounded by strangers – the random doctors and nurses that happen to be on duty that day. Just giving birth is stressful enough, so you might want to consider hiring your own team to help you feel as comfortable as possible. Most pregnant women choose an obstetrician, but a midwife is often the better option. According to the American College of Nurse-Midwives, nearly 92 percent of US women pick an obstetrician, even though obstetricians specialize in dealing with high-risk and complicated pregnancies that very few women have. So if you’re expecting a normal pregnancy, the better option is to find a midwife whom you’re comfortable with. One of the primary benefits of having a good midwife is that she’ll have more time to provide you with personal care. Midwives can also competently handle all aspects of giving birth; they can help you avoid undergoing a C-section as well as attend to any trauma or injuries that may occur. And if you’re concerned about any complications, don’t worry – midwives are trained to recognize situations where an obstetrician is required. In 2013, gynecologist Nancy S. Roberts conducted comparative studies between the midwife model – which is prevalent in Europe – and the popular obstetrician model of the United States. The results clearly showed that, by using a midwife, there is less risk of illnesses and fatalities for both the baby and the mother. Another good option is to find a doula. Doulas are childbirth specialists, and they can provide invaluable assistance in getting through the labor process. However, since there are no regulations regarding doula certification, their qualifications can vary greatly. So it’s important to do your homework and check their background. It’s best to find a doula who is familiar with how hospitals handle patients in labor. That way, you’ll avoid hiring someone who may get into a heated disagreement with hospital staff while you’re suffering labor pains. Believe it or not, 50 years ago there weren’t any detailed lists enumerating the foods that pregnant women shouldn’t eat. Pregnant women ate just about whatever they wanted. This might sound worrisome, but the fact is that people had healthier diets back then, so there was far less risk of a woman gaining too much weight during pregnancy and thus endangering her child’s future. One of the best examples is high fructose corn syrup, which simply wasn’t used in products in the past. Today, however, it’s used in almost everything, and its prevalence has tripled the amount of calories in staple foods. Past foods also had far less preservatives, chemicals and artificial flavors. Not to mention that the portions were a lot smaller back then. During the 1950s and 1960s, pregnant women typically wouldn’t gain more than 30 pounds. And if they did, their doctors weren’t afraid to be condescending and scold them for it. This might sound unprofessional by today’s standards – but a brief lecture is better than the 60 to 80 pounds that many pregnant women put on nowadays. Weight gain isn’t only detrimental to their own health; it also puts the future health of their child at risk. This is why we have those detailed lists to help guide pregnant women toward a healthy diet.   Some of these diets seem complicated, but if you stick to it and follow the rules, they can really provide the optimal nutrients for an expecting mother. Part of a successful diet is knowing what to avoid. Things like soft cheeses, unpasteurized beverages and raw or undercooked animal products can contain seriously harmful bacteria and toxins. To maintain a good diet, it’s also important to know which foods contain the vitamins and nutrients that expecting moms need for optimal health. These include fruits and vegetables, whole grains and a good amount of lean protein. Ideally, every meal should have these elements, as well as things rich in calcium, such as milk, leafy greens and tofu. A fetus in a womb is not unlike a fish in a puddle. If the fish is going to survive, there needs to be enough water. Part of the reason for having routine checkups with your doctor is to make sure there’s enough amniotic fluid in your womb and to ascertain whether or not you have polyhydramnios, a rare condition where the womb contains too much fluid. Only one percent of pregnant mothers will experience this condition, and, even in them, it’s usually harmless and will go away on its own. However, it has been known to cause some serious complications, such as premature births, stillbirths or having the baby get stuck in an uncomfortable position.   Unfortunately, the reasons behind this condition are mostly unknown. Fluid levels are generally regulated by how the baby swallows, so it’s believed that the condition might be due to infections or other health issues that might interfere with development and swallowing. Another theory might be related to the mother having diabetes, yet that only accounts for half of the cases. The rest remain a mystery. Mothers can also experience oligohydramnios, the condition of having less amniotic fluid than there should be. This is also rare – four percent of pregnant women experience it – but it can have dire effects, including miscarriage and still or premature births in the early stages. In the later stages, especially after the water breaks, it can cause the umbilical cord to get pinched, which restricts the blood flow and oxygen supply to the baby. There are two potential signs of oligohydramnios that you can look for. If you’re leaking fluid or haven’t been gaining weight, check with your doctor to make sure your amniotic fluid levels are okay. If you’re at the beginning of your first pregnancy, you’re probably dreading the idea of going into labor. Yet when those final weeks of pregnancy arrive, and the discomfort has reached its peak, most women can’t wait for labor to start.    The last few weeks of a pregnancy are an exhausting mix of cramps and aching and swollen body parts. It can feel intolerable, and, to make matters worse, the baby is regularly punching or kicking a vital organ every time it moves. No wonder that inducing labor is such a popular procedure. According to the obstetricians Osterman and Martin, between 1990 and 2012, induced labor increased dramatically, from just 9.5 percent of pregnancies to 23.3 percent. While it’s understandable, the truth is that artificially induced labor is being over-prescribed and should be reserved for emergencies only. A naturally occurring labor prepares the mother’s body for giving birth, whereas artificially induced labor usually leads to a C-section operation, which is far more likely to cause injuries or even death. This is why inductions should be limited to emergencies and instances when the mother or the child’s life is at risk. An appropriate case for C-section is when the mother’s blood pressure is reaching dangerously high levels. According to Dutch gynecologist Corine Koopmans, high blood pressure is closely related to birth complications, since it can weaken the mother’s organs, especially the kidneys. As a result, the baby can become weak, underweight and susceptible to injury. In cases like this, both the mother and the baby are better off with induced labor. No matter what you read or who you talk to, there’s really nothing that can prepare you for the real experience of going through labor and giving birth. But one thing you can prepare for is differentiating between labor and pre-labor. Pre-labor pains can start as late as ten days prior to your expected due date, and the pain can leave you feeling so horrible and exhausted that you’ll be 100-percent positive that your labor has begun. But what’s more likely is that you’re only a little bit dilated, and that these initial contractions are only helping to get the baby into the right position for delivery. It’s important that the child be as low as possible in the pelvis. As painful as this can be, if you’re still able to breathe and speak normally, and are able to move around to get things done, you likely have another day or two before the real labor starts. Another way to tell that contractions are just pre-labor is to lie down in a hot tub or go for a walk – if the contractions are not regular, or if they settle down and become less painful, it is not real labor. When the actual labor begins, the pain will be much worse. At this point, the contractions will no longer feel like bad menstrual cramps. You’ll feel excruciating pain shoot along your back and legs, and the contractions will come at faster intervals until they’re happening every two or three minutes, with only a minute of respite in between. When this happens, it’s time to get yourself to the hospital. If you’ve ever seen one of the countless movies or television shows featuring a character who goes into labor, then you probably know that being in labor is made easier by employing certain breathing techniques. How you breathe is essential for managing labor pain.     The most popular breathing technique that you’ll see in movies is the Lamaze method. This method involves inhaling twice and then exhaling twice, while making the sounds “hee-hee” (when you breathe in) and “hoo-hoo” (when you breathe out).   It’s a tried-and-true method, but really any kind of deep, rhythmic breathing will help you get through labor. The important thing is to focus your attention away from the pain by concentrating on your breathing. This can also relax the mind, increase the flow of oxygen and provide a helpful boost of energy. But if you really want this technique to work when it matters most, you will need to practice. Whether you’re going with Lamaze or any other technique, you should practice it for the duration of your pregnancy. Remember, when it comes to the pain and excitement of childbirth, you’ll have a lot of distractions to cope with. But you will find, that with practice, an effective breathing technique will help you dilate much quicker than you might expect. Another method of easing the labor pains is to use a bath. Lying in hot water is one of the simplest and most effective ways to relax and provide much needed pain relief. Ideally, you should be able to fill the water in your tub or Jacuzzi high enough to cover your entire belly, but if this isn’t possible you can use a towel to cover the exposed area and keep it warm. Nowadays, many hospitals provide the option of having a water birth, either in a tub, a Jacuzzi or an inflatable pool. So if this sounds like the procedure for you, make sure to do your research and find a hospital that offers it. You might think that after going through the painful ordeal of childbirth you deserve a nice relaxing break, right? Unfortunately, life has other plans.   There are a number of physical ordeals and discomforts awaiting you after birth. Don’t be surprised when, during the first six weeks following a birth, you experience cramps, bleeding and a soreness in your lower abdomen and vagina. Feeding your child is an ordeal. Breastfeeding often entails swollen, bruised and leaky breasts with dry and cracked skin. And then there’s the sleep deprivation. You should be thankful if you can snatch two hours of rest before being interrupted by your child’s cries for milk and attention. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to help you through this trying time. Warm baths are a great way to cope with the common swelling and soreness that follows a traditional, vaginal birth. Another useful tip is to buy extra-large hygiene pads, soak them in water and put them in the freezer. A couple of times a day, you can place an ice pad in your underwear for about 15 minutes for some soothing relief. Of course, there is also pain-relief medication, such as ibuprofen, Vicodin and lidocaine. These are especially useful when trying to deal with the strong pain following a C-section delivery. This pain can last for a few weeks, and you shouldn’t hesitate to take medication if it’s been prescribed to you. However, you should remain in contact with your health care provider during this time, as there is a risk of becoming addicted.

    "title": "Dangerously Sleepy",
    "author": "Alan Derickson",
    "summary": "“But first, coffee” – such slogans are common not only as cafe advertisements but as general mantras among working professionals and students. Many people fuel themselves with caffeine and other drugs to be hyper-productive while sacrificing sleep, which is seen as a waste of valuable time. Perhaps you remember your own college days, when students would compete about how many all-nighters they’d pulled while preparing for exams! Indeed, sleep is often associated with weakness and decay. Why is that? Where did this idea come from? And what are the negative side effects of refusing to rest? In these blinks, you’ll learn how Edison’s invention of electricity is connected to his championing of less sleep; why little sleep came to be associated with masculinity and achievement; and about the dangerous risks of sleep deprivation. Perhaps you’ve heard the saying, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead.” Such sayings are emblematic of a common American attitude – that sleep is for chumps, for the lazy masses who have nothing better to do. But when did this unhealthy attitude start? To find that out, we’ll have to rewind back to the eighteenth century, when one of the nation’s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin, gave the subject some serious consideration. Before he was a politician, Benjamin Franklin was a prototypical polymath whose long list of professions included inventor, newspaper printer and author. One of his publications was the yearly Poor Richard’s Almanack, which included poems, proverbs, astrology and useful advice for the early settlers of the 1730s. One of his most famous sayings from the almanac, a saying still bandied about today, is “early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.” In 1735, when Franklin published this advice, he warned people that getting up late would only leave them scrambling and trying in vain to catch up on lost time. Franklin’s own sleep habits were relatively normal, and perhaps surprisingly economical. He would end every day at 10:00 p.m. and wake up every morning at 5:00 a.m. But as time went on, Franklin’s attitude began to change, and sleep became ever more undesirable. During the 1740s, in other writings under his “Poor Richard” pen name, Franklin took on a more judgmental view toward sleep. His maxims now implored people to get up, to stop wasting their lives; he even started telling people that there would be time enough for sleep once they were six feet under. Franklin’s anti-sleep attitude may well have been spurred to life by John Calvin. Franklin deeply admired the Protestant reformer, a man known for his aversion to sleep. When Calvin died at the relatively young age of 55, Franklin noted in his eulogy that he’d actually lived much longer than most, since he’d wasted so little time on sleep and sloth. When you think of Thomas Edison’s contributions to society, you probably think of his inventions, like the light bulb or the phonograph. You perhaps even admire his impressive productivity. But what many people don’t think about are the long-lasting repercussions of the tireless industriousness that enabled Edison to be so prolific. Thomas Edison was certainly a major role model for early Americans, and his example, perhaps more than anything else, advanced a culture of sleeplessness in the young nation. First of all, by introducing the light bulb, Edison made the idea of working through the night a truly viable option. And as the founder of General Electric, Edison had a million reasons for wanting his workers to believe in the competitive advantages of foregoing sleep. Edison was so committed to promoting the merits of going without sleep that he conspired with journalists and spoke to the public at exhibitions. The message was clear: Sleep is a waste of time! Sleeplessness also influenced Edison’s hiring practices. He only chose employees who showed a willingness to stay up and work for long stretches at a time. Newspapers, fascinated with Edison’s success story, were more than willing to spread his message. In a 1878 edition of the Chicago Tribune, an admiring profile detailed Edison’s tireless work ethic; he stayed awake, day and night, only resting for two or three hours to rejuvenate. It wasn’t hard for people to see how Edison’s successful inventions were linked to his policy of sleeplessness. In 1879, Edison improved upon his light bulb by creating a more durable and longer-lasting filament, an invention that surely helped Edison and his team work through many sleepless nights to develop his plan of distributing electricity throughout the United States. His reputation was further cemented in 1885 when the poet and activist Sarah Bolton published How Success is Won. In it, Bolton recounted a particularly impressive stretch when Edison worked for 60 hours straight, and she estimated that his average workday around that time lasted 18 hours. In the twentieth century, a new breed of sleepless masculinity emerged – one that both grabbed the public’s attention and embodied their adventurous spirit. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh became an American idol and a paragon of manliness when he announced that he would break records by piloting a plane over the Atlantic Ocean. If successful, Lindbergh would fly his plane 3,600 miles, from New York to Paris, and shatter records for the longest flight ever attempted. But in order for his plan to succeed, Lindbergh had to make his fifty-foot plane as light as possible. This meant flying alone and without any communication equipment on board. Naturally, Lindbergh’s unprecedented feat captured the public imagination. He was dubbed “The Lone Eagle” and newspapers were filled with eagerly awaited reports of his every move. One of the most fascinating aspects of Lindbergh’s flight was his need to remain awake. It would last a total of thirty-three and a half hours, and Lindbergh would be risking death if he nodded off for even a moment. Lindbergh’s plane began its historic journey on May 20, 1927, and the press immediately escalated the suspense. In the New York Times, other long-distance pilots were insisting that the most crucial factor wasn’t the weather or the plane’s gadgets but Lindbergh’s ability to stay awake. The press further stoked the excitement by reporting that Lindbergh had only managed to sleep for an hour or two on the night before his take off. But Lindbergh landed quite safely in Paris on the evening of May 21st. And when the press ran to get his statements, he seemed to want to maintain his public image of rugged virility. So, even though he appeared rather groggy after landing his plane, he told the Chicago Tribune that it was no problem at all to stay awake during the flight. Lindbergh is still celebrated for his sleeplessness. Few future shunners of sleep would enjoy such accolades. In the 1980s, there was a new global economy that required people to work longer hours than ever. Since money never sleeps, more people were adopting the same attitude, despite the fact that there was also a booming fitness craze. Remarkably, psychologists and scientists were also claiming that there were health benefits to sleeping less. Journalists were seemingly happy to perpetuate the myth of sleepless success by seeking out scientific data that supported this narrative. There were entire books devoted to the subject. Everett Mattlin’s 1979 book, Sleep Less, Live More, was filled with research that argued against the need for eight hours of sleep per night. In 1981, psychologist Ernest Hartmann released his own findings, which suggested that those who sleep six hours or less are more energetic, capable, successful and happy. He even encouraged people to train themselves to sleep less in order to reap these benefits, just as dieters need to change their lifestyle if they hope to lose weight. The 1980s were also filled with charismatic business leaders that further promoted the sleepless American lifestyle. One of the best examples is Walmart CEO, Samuel Walton. He was famous for his weekly 7:00 a.m. Saturday staff meetings, which he would get up at 2:00 a.m. to prepare for by meticulously reviewing the sales figures of all his stores. Stories about Walton’s methods took on mythical proportions in Tom Peters’s book, In Search of Excellence, which highlights Walton’s eccentric, late-night motivational tactics, like showing up at Walmart’s distribution centers at 2:30 a.m. to surprise employees with a bag of donuts. A normal business day for Sam Walton began at 6:00 a.m. and didn’t end until the clock struck midnight. And given the obvious success of Walmart, business executives across the United States were eager to follow his lead and put in 90-hour workweeks. But one 1980s businessman embodied this ethos better, perhaps, than all the rest... Thanks to the tumultuous presidential elections of 2016, Donald Trump has come to represent a lot of different things to a lot of different people. But there’s one thing that has remained consistent since his days as a real-estate mogul in the 1980s: he doesn’t care for sleep. Over the past 20 years, Trump has been an icon for hypermasculine business executives, and he’s made his distaste for sleep a part of that image. Since his first high-profile real estate deals in the 1980s, Trump has been very active in crafting and promoting his own public persona. In his first best-selling book, Trump: The Art of the Deal, he laid out the central ingredients to his recipe for success, and one of them is to work extremely hard and sleep as little as possible. He emphasizes the importance of getting a leg up on competitors by waking up earlier than them and taking advantage of a business environment that never sleeps. In his 2004 book, Trump: Think Like a Billionaire, he told readers that his own sleeping schedule had shrunk to four hours, between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., and encouraged them to sleep as little as possible. This kind of mentality can also be seen in the world of sports. In the National Football League, players, coaches and managers can all be held up as examples of great, masculine leaders. Some of the most successful managers were famous for their sleepless management style. For 60 years, George Halas worked 16-hour days while managing the Chicago Bears until his death in 1983. Halas’s former assistant, George Allen, adopted this strenuous work ethic when he became the manager of the Washington Redskins. Allen only slept a few hours every night and he used his office as a bedroom so that he wouldn’t have to waste time commuting. At this point, you might be wondering: Was there anyone supporting regulated working hours? Let’s find out in the next blink. Even if your workday is a typical nine-to-five event, it can still lead to feelings of stress, burnout and being overworked. But look on the bright side! At least you aren’t working in the early 1900s. Despite horrific working conditions throughout the nineteenth century, there were still no regulations regarding working hours when the United States entered the twentieth century. Those hoping for improvements were paying close attention to the Supreme Court case of Lochner v. New York. The case focused on the poor working conditions of bakers, the majority of whom worked in cold, cramped cellars with little to no daylight. Their health was suffering as a consequence. At the center of the lawsuit was a bill that New York had passed that limited the working schedule of bakers to a maximum of ten hours per day and 60 hours per week. But after a routine inspection, bakery employer John Lochner was indicted by the state for violating these new rules and he appealed his case all the way to the US Supreme Court. Unfortunately, those hoping for federal intervention were let down when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Lochner, calling it a private matter between the baker and his employees. Regulations eventually did start to appear, when a similar case, this time involving women in the state of Oregon, appeared before the Supreme Court in 1908. Oregon had passed legislation to limit the working hours of female employees in commercial laundry houses. Future Supreme Court justice, Louis Brandeis, represented the state when it appeared before the court, and he delivered a passionate speech; he argued that by working over ten hours per day, women were risking their ability to bear children. It might seem like an unusual argument today, but it worked and successfully convinced the Supreme Court to support the state’s regulations. However, the lack of overall federal regulation would go on to promote dangerous conditions for generations to come. When you think about scandalous working conditions, you might think they’re limited to coal miners and factory workers, but this problem continues to be a very immediate and widespread threat. Hospital accidents are a prime example of how exhausted workers suffering from sleep deprivation continue to be a problem. It took an unfortunate and deadly case for regulations to finally be established in the healthcare field: In March of 1984, Libby Zion was admitted to the Manhattan Hospital in New York. The 18-year-old was diagnosed with flu-like symptoms, but otherwise she was a healthy young woman. So it came as a shock when, just a few hours later, Libby died. Reports were unclear, but it seems likely that she was mistakenly prescribed tranquilizers that reacted fatally with the anti-depressants she was on. What was clear was that the hospital’s staff, being overworked to be the point of incompetence, played a significant role in her death. The intern placed in charge of her care had been working 100-hour weeks, including three night-shifts per week. While Libby’s health was rapidly deteriorating during her brief stay, this intern was busy having to deal with other clients and didn’t check in on her. She only managed to ask nurses to restrain her and increase the dosage of the tranquilizer that likely killed her. If there’s a silver lining here, it’s that Libby Zion’s father sued the hospital, and a grand jury decided action needed to be taken. They didn’t rule against the doctors for negligence; instead, they recommended that the working hours for physicians be regulated. And a year later, that’s just what happened. Physician Bertrand Bell headed a committee that decided medical professionals would work no more than 80 hours a week, and no longer than 24 hours at one time. And every week, they must have an uninterrupted 24 hour break in order to recuperate. This is a good sign, but, sadly, such a commitment to safety is still the exception rather than the rule. The key message in this book: A lot of businessmen, scientists and other hard-working professionals believe that not sleeping is a manly achievement to be celebrated, and one of the keys to success in the business world. But, in fact, it’s an unfortunate legacy of the industrial revolution, and it’s resulted in Americans being overworked in an unhealthy and potentially deadly fashion. Actionable advice: Make yourself a sleeping plan. Sleeping less than six hours a night will have adverse effects on your work. So carve out enough time for a good night’s rest during your busy schedule. You’ll likely find that your work efficiency actually improves when you get a solid amount of rest. Got feedback?

    "title": "100 Million Years Of Food",
    "author": "Stephen Le",
    "summary": "Something is clearly wrong with our eating habits. Today, diet-related diseases plague the Western world. More people suffer from type 2 diabetes, obesity and food allergies, not to mention many forms of cancer, than ever before. But what exactly is wrong with how we’re eating – and what should we be doing instead? The diets of our ancestors provide a few answers. They were generally much healthier than modern-day humans, so it’s no wonder that the last decade has witnessed a major uptick in caveman or paleo diets. But to get a full picture we have to go back even further in time – starting with our earliest, tree-dwelling ancestors 100 million years ago and exploring how these forebears adapted to changing environments and diets. These blinks discuss whether the dietary choices of these distant progenitors would work for us today. On this journey through human evolution, you’ll learn why we should eat some bugs every now and then; about a strange illness that affected mainly the well-off; and why milk isn’t nearly as healthy as you may think. If one of our first ancestors walked into one of today’s supermarkets, he’d be stunned by the options. After all, the difference between the overflowing shelves of contemporary grocery stores and the dinnertime options available to our ancient ancestors could hardly be greater. Our earliest ancestors, who emerged around 100 million years ago, lived in the trees of tropical forests and primarily ate insects. That might sound gross to us now, but insects are actually a calorie-rich source of vitamins and iron. In fact, insects would still make a great addition to the modern human diet. But for us to attempt to live only on bugs wouldn’t be so smart. Our ancestors had enzymes that allowed them to break down the exoskeletons of insects, which are made of chitin, a substance that we can no longer digest. Another problem with eating bugs is that they can trigger allergies and produce harmful toxins. But in moderation, the consumption of insects would be a great boon to modern food production. For instance, crickets produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than cows per pound and convert feed into calories 12 times more efficiently. Nonetheless, our ancestors transitioned away from creepy crawlies around 60 million years ago. Around this time, the climate began cooling and, as the air grew more humid, the first fruit-bearing trees emerged. During the same period, our ancestors lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C, which is essential to preventing cell damage. They only survived this change because they could get plenty of vitamin C from fruit. So around 30 million years ago our ancestors became full-time fruit eaters. However, eating too much fruit can also be bad since fruit contains fructose, something our body can only metabolize so much of; overconsumption can lead to insulin resistance and pancreatic cancer. The actor Ashton Kutcher learned this the hard way. When preparing to portray Steve Jobs, Kutcher followed the tech CEO’s fruitarian diet for a month. After just 30 days, Kutcher was hospitalized with pancreatic issues. About two million years ago, our ancestors began migrating out of the trees and adapting to a terrestrial lifestyle. They started to look more human and their diets changed, too. Around the same time, these early humans began hunting and foraging, eating more meat than they ever had before. As a result, their brains started growing rapidly. In fact, the brain size of our ancestors doubled over the course of just one million years, a change that may well have been the result of their newly carnivorous diets. Meat, packed with important fatty acids, is the perfect fuel for a growing brain. And big brains also gave our ancestors an evolutionary advantage. Smarter, more coordinated groups of hunters could bring home more prey, which meant their families were in turn more likely to survive and reproduce. But while meat has plenty of benefits, eating too much of it is bad for our health. Meat is loaded with protein, which we can only tolerate in limited quantities. When the human body digests proteins, it produces potentially toxic substances called nitrogen compounds. If a person gets more than 40 percent of their daily calories from protein, the levels of these compounds get too high. Another reason excess meat consumption can be detrimental to our health is that it contains a lot of cholesterol, which can combine with other substances and clog up our arteries. But cholesterol isn’t all bad. It’s a precursor to essential sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen, and it also increases the level of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, which is good for our moods. Our livers and intestines produce most of the body’s cholesterol on their own, but animal products like meat and dairy provide additional inputs that affect our hormone levels. As a result, girls on a cholesterol-rich diet reach sexual maturity earlier. That means they can procreate earlier, potentially producing more offspring, but they also have reduced life expectancies. Nowadays, with all the choices available to us, it’s easy to eat a balanced vegetarian diet. But alternatives to red meat are nothing new. Our meat-loving ancestors even branched out. For instance, in many cultures, fish predominated, although not all people developed a taste for it. Here’s how it happened: In many areas where meat was hard to come by, locals embraced fish as an accessible and nutritious food. This was a smart choice since, as we now know, fatty fish contain loads of healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, which is key to bone health. However, not every culture with access to fish chose to eat it. This bias wasn’t merely due to the difficulties of eating fish (all those pesky bones!); there were also cultural reasons. Some cultures regarded fish as a sacred animal that lived in a sacred element. Others, like the Apache Indians, considered fish to be unclean. Another important meat substitute emerged around 8,000 years ago: animal milk. Though it’s often still regarded as an elixir of sorts, animal milk isn’t as healthy for human consumption as some think. The Northern European nations were among the first people to consume animal milk, which has innumerable benefits. It’s nutritious, rich in calcium and whereas an animal can only be eaten once, it can be milked many times over. Statistics link milk consumption to increased growth in children, but this boost in height may come at the price of bone health. This correlation can be seen in the nations with the highest dairy intake; the citizens of these nations, because of their above-average height, also experience the highest rates of hip fractures in the world. A further issue with milk is that people from regions with little history of dairy consumption absorb calcium more efficiently. This means that if a man from, say, Africa drinks a lot of milk, he might experience dangerously elevated calcium levels. This is especially risky since research has linked high blood-calcium levels to prostate cancer. Next up we’ll explore the history of vegetables and their place in the nutritional hierarchy. All parents have insisted, at one time or another, that their kid eat her veggies. After all, veggies are healthy and packed with nutrients, right? Well, the truth is, most plants are actually unhealthy and many are even dangerous. Why? Well, plants are surrounded by other organisms that want to eat them and they have no way to run. Since they can’t escape, they have to defend themselves. They do this by engaging in chemical warfare: producing chemicals that discourage, harm and sometimes kill the animals that try to eat them. For instance, vegetables like squash and cucumbers can contain a bitter substance known as cucurbitacin to discourage consumption, and it’s only the domesticated versions where the excessive bitterness can be bred out. Or take beans, lentils and soybeans, which contain a group of chemicals called lectins. If you eat too many of them, you’ll get sick and you might suffer liver damage. In fact, one of the most lethal poisons known to man is a type of lectin. It’s called ricin and it’s found in the seeds of the castor oil plant. Even a tiny amount of ricin is enough to cause a painful death. So why did humans begin eating plants in the first place? Well, the truth is, we turned to farming and eating plants because the other food options became scarce. This turn toward agriculture occurred around 12,000 years ago in many parts of the world simultaneously. There are lots of theories as to why this happened, but it was primarily caused by the extinction of large, delicious animals such as the mammoth. These creatures likely died due to overhunting by humans and the spread of trees into the grasslands they called home. With the loss of this major food source, humans began looking for other options. They settled on plants because they were readily available and could be easily produced. From that point on, plant-based foods dominated in densely populated areas and places where animals were hard to keep. The human body is surprisingly adaptable and we can get used to big dietary changes. But doing so can take many generations. The slow nature of this process posed a problem when food processing began to become the norm. Humans, with little time to adapt to this change, suddenly faced a variety of new illnesses. For instance, in the second half of the nineteenth century, a frightening disease called beriberi emerged among the richer people of East and Southeast Asia. The affected patients presented with heart issues, mobility problems and mental confusion. In the end, it was discovered that the illness was caused by a severe B1 deficiency. Wealthier people were affected because they could afford the “better” highly polished rice, which had been stripped of most of its B1. Then, around 1900, pellagra became endemic among poorer populations of the American South. These groups had been subsisting on products made from industrially milled corn, which, compared to fresh corn, is extremely low in vitamin B3. The disease caused horrible symptoms like red lesions, weakness and even dementia. Obviously, processed food is an issue, but it’s not the only problem. Other lifestyle changes can also be detrimental to our health. Just take asthma and food allergies, both of which are on the rise. There’s some debate about why, but it’s likely that lifestyle decisions are to blame. After all, most people spend lots of time indoors. As a result, we’re not exposed to much sunlight, and suffer lower levels of vitamin D, also known as the “sunshine vitamin.” This in turn causes human allergies to rise as pregnant women with reduced vitamin D levels are more likely to give birth to allergic children. If you don’t buy that theory, consider the hygiene hypothesis. It postulates that modern day kids develop allergies and asthma because they grow up too clean. The idea is that a child’s immune system needs to be exposed to some germs to learn how to discern harmless proteins from deadly bacteria and fight infections without unnecessarily harming the body. Did you know that Japanese people eat an average of 300 fewer calories per capita than Americans? That sounds healthy, but is it worth following their example? Actually, there are upsides and downsides to limiting your caloric intake. For instance, the Japanese live longer than Americans, but that’s not proof that their way is better. Eating too few calories can deprive your brain of fuel and might cause you to lose focus. Not just that, but consuming too little protein for a period will cause muscle weakness. So it’s a question of trade-offs. For instance, lots of animals, when going through a period of food scarcity, will reduce inessential bodily functions, like reproduction. And the same goes for humans: women who eat fewer calories will live longer, but they’ll be less fertile and more irritable. In fact, even if you’re overweight, counting every calorie isn’t a good idea. For starters, it’s actually healthier to be slightly overweight. For example, people who are a few pounds heavier than average, those with a body mass index between 25 and 30 live longer than people of normal weights. This could be because heavier people have more fat to protect them from toxins and more energy to compensate for weight lost during periods of severe illness. But even if it weren’t healthy to have a few extra pounds, the link between weight and caloric intake is actually weaker than you might expect. The truth is, research has found that slim, modern-day hunter-gatherers eat about as many calories as your average contemporary American and engage in comparable levels of physical activity. The only difference is they have a greater variance in caloric intake over the seasons. Simply put, not all differences in body weight can be chalked up to calories and exercise. And finally, paying attention to your total calories, without considering what type of food they come from, is useless. If all your calories come from junk food and soda, it doesn’t matter how few of them you consume. Imagine your friend invites you out to lunch at a buffet but you’re trying to eat healthily. Are you better off going for a bowl of oatmeal, some meatballs or just sticking with Prosecco? The answer is, it depends. After all, most foods and beverages aren’t simply good or bad. Everyone is different and, to determine which foods are good for you, you need to consider your age, heritage and how much of any given thing you’ll eat. Just take alcohol. If you drink too much, you’ll damage your brain and gut. However, studies have found that moderate consumption of alcohol in people over the age of forty helps to fight coronary heart disease. That being said, lots of people of Asian descent need to be cautious when drinking. That’s because they’re genetically predisposed to produce lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme your body needs to break down alcohol in your stomach. As a result, more alcohol enters the bloodstream of Asian people per drink than enters the bloodstream of their Caucasian peers, causing them to become more intoxicated. Similarly, as you learned in a previous blink, girls who eat lots of meat reach sexual maturity more quickly and are therefore at increased risk of certain cancers. However, for elderly women, early onset puberty is obviously a non-issue and eating more meat will likely increase their strength. So dietary needs vary dramatically from person to person, but that doesn’t mean food should be a private affair. Eating today can be a lonely activity. But remember that our ancestors used to hunt together and share their food communally. This served to strengthen community bonds and ensured that everyone got a fair share. To reap these benefits, we should make meals more communal. Doing so can be as easy as sharing more meals with friends or endorsing pay-what-you-can restaurants. By taking such actions, we can once again make eating an area of life in which people care for one another. The key message in this book: The human diet has evolved dramatically over the past few million years. By following this evolutionary trail, we can understand the factors that shape our modern diets. While there’s no general dietary prescription that applies to all people, there are some guidelines that might improve both health and happiness. Actionable advice: Sell your car to save your health. Everyone knows that an active lifestyle is a healthy lifestyle. But as long as we have the choice, we tend to stick with what’s comfortable. So consider selling your car and forcing yourself to use modes of transportation that require some exercise. If you’re not sure it’s a good move for your health, just consider the residents of certain mountainous islands, on which it was impractical to build roads. Since they never had roads, traveling by car was never an option. These islanders get around on foot and by bike and, in the end, they live longer, healthier lives than their mainland peers.

    "title": "A General Theory of Love",
    "author": "Thomas Lewis, Fari Amini and Richard Lannon",
    "summary": "Usually, when we talk about love, we don't talk about it scientifically. Human love is often seen as a mysterious and irreducible phenomenon that exists outside the cold realm of science, and as one that simply won’t yield to its scientific understanding. Because the subject of love has long been considered the dominion of poets and artists exclusively, we tend to think that scientists have little or nothing to contribute to our understanding of it. Fortunately, three psychiatrists – Thomas Lewis, Fari Amini and Richard Lannon – don’t believe in this unilateral distinction. In order to address the mystery of love as incisively and comprehensively as possible, they combine their scientific and practical expertise with the rich cultural heritage that artists, poets and philosophers have left for us over the centuries. In the blinks, you’ll discover: how our brain evolved over time to enable us to feel attachment to others; how our adult relationships are shaped by our childhood experiences; how psychotherapy can help us rewire our brains, enabling us to develop healthy relationships; why self-harm reduces severe emotional pain in certain people; and why it’s essential that we understand the difference between loving and being in love. The demystification of human emotions by science is not a recent thing. As early as 450 BC, the Western world’s first physician, Hippocrates, proposed that emotions – such as love – are a product of the brain. Even though Hippocrates’ hypothesis turned out to be correct, it took more than 2000 years before scientists began to closely examine the brain and the effect it has on human behavior. Today, thanks to the scientific discoveries of the past few decades, our knowledge of the brain has far exceeded that which even the prescient Hippocrates could have predicted. One such discovery is that of how the human brain evolved over the millennia. In order to survive, our ancestors had to adapt to their changing environments. This included changes in their brains, which helped them to survive in new climates and conditions. For example, our distant ancestors were forced by climate change to move from the forest habitat to the dry savannah planes. In order to survive in this harsh environment, their brains had to adapt to out-smart predators and find food. Gradually, step by step, adaptation by adaptation, our established brain structures were transformed. What evidence do we have to support this theory? The human brain’s evolutionary history can be found in its three subsections. The oldest of these, the Reptilian Brain, sits at the top of the spinal cord and controls our most basic bodily functions and impulses. Next is the Limbic Brain, situated around the reptilian brain. Here you can find such famous components as the amygdala, which plays a major role in the production of fear. The development of the limbic brain has been crucial for the evolution of mammals. In contrast to reptiles, it enables them to feel attachment towards their young. As a result, mammals – unlike reptiles – form close social groups, will protect children or mates and play with each other. The newest and largest section of the human brain is the Newest Brain – or Neocortex. The Neocortex is behind such qualities as reasoning, planning and speaking, and allows us, for example, to make decisions based on careful thinking rather than instinct. As you’ll see in the following blinks, this three-part brain schema helps us to understand why our behavior in relationships is often surprising. Emotions such as love or attachment feel so powerful and wonderful that we often think they must be the product of something as equally profound and mysterious. Unfortunately, this isn’t true. Love and attachment are, like all feelings, the product of chemicals in the brain, called neurotransmitters. There are three important neurotransmitters that influence our sense of attachment. The first is serotonin and its role includes relieving feelings of anxiety and depression. In some people, serotonin can even reduce the traumatic effects of grief and heartbreak when they lose a person with whom they felt a close attachment. And for people in unhappy relationships, who can’t let go because they fear the feelings of loss, increasing their levels of serotonin – for example, by means of anti-depressant medications such as Prozac – can help them to finally make the break. The second neurotransmitter responsible for attachment is oxytocin. This chemical is present in high quantity during childbirth and is therefore responsible for the bond between mother and child. However, it also plays a role in the emotion of attachment throughout life too. In a study of two species of prairie dog – the vole and the montane vole – Thomas Insel observed that, in adulthood, voles are monogamous: they mate for life and spend much of their day sitting side by side. In contrast, the montane vole, is a much less social creature: their display of attachment behavior is minimal, as they practice promiscuity and often abandon their young. What could be behind such wildly different behavior? Insel’s major insight was that the answer could be found in the brains of the two species – and the only difference he found between them was the level of oxytocin. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at the third important chemical: opiates. When a child touches a hot stove, he will most likely cry out in pain. Because the child won’t want to experience such pain again, he’ll probably think twice about going near a hot stove again. The development of a neural system that senses injury was a crucial step in human evolution, because physical damage puts the body at risk of death. Thus, the feeling of pain helps humans to stay away from anything that could potentially hurt them. However, although the brain’s ability to produce pain is crucial to human survival, an equally important ability is that it can reduce pain when it arises. This is where the third main neurotransmitter involved in attachment comes into play: opiates. Opiates can alleviate both physical and emotional pain: they help us to feel better when going through emotional trauma and the hardships that follow painful events such as the breakdown of a romantic relationship. Why do these chemicals perform this dual function? When the limbic brain was developing, mammals needed the ability to become attached to each other and to deal with the pain that strikes when an attachment is lost. Since the brain had already developed a system for experiencing and alleviating physical pain (using opiates), this simply was adapted to deal with emotional pain. Sounds nifty? Well, there’s a dark side: this dual role of opiates might be responsible for why some people harm themselves physically when experiencing emotional hardship. Most teens who cut themselves suffer from overwhelming emotional pain caused by traumatic social experiences. When they cut their skin, pain signals are sent to their brain. The brain then releases opiates to numb the physical suffering and – as a side-effect – relieve the emotional pain at the same time. In this way, self-harm might help them to feel better. Have you noticed that when you read a text, even several times, you often fail to spot small typos, such as \"taht\" instead of \"that\"? Why does this happen? This kind of common oversight is due to the presence of Attractors in the human brain. In neural terms, they are the interconnected elements of our memory that govern or influence our perception, directing what we learn and experience. For example, many of us have poor handwriting: our letters are misshapen and joined together so that each word becomes a scrawl. Yet, with very little effort, a reader can interpret even the worst handwriting correctly. For example, even if your handwritten “H” looks more like an “A,” your readers will still read the word “aouse” as “house.” Why? Engraved in our memories is an ideal or prototype letter “H.” Each time we see a letter that appears similar to this ideal, the prototype overpowers our perception, taking command of it, thus enabling us to quickly “autocorrect” any misshapen letters or typos. For example, if we come across the typo “taht,” the Attractor responsible for the prototype “that” kicks in, enabling us to understand the writer’s intended meaning. What do Attractors have to do with attachment? Attractors are established through our life experiences, and those experiences shape our memories. From our earliest experiences, our brains construct Attractors which link our memories together. Whether one is linked to another depends on the connections we have built in our brain between them. For instance, if we have an ideal “H,” that’s because we’ve been taught what an “H” should look like. The same is true of our limbic brain – the part of the brain responsible for our feelings. Our experiences enable us to develop the ideal feeling of attachment. Throughout our lives, this ideal will determine how we experience attachment and towards whom we feel it most intensely. In the previous blink, we saw that our emotional memory works as an ensemble of many different, interconnected elements called Attractors. Every human being develops such networks during its lifetime and, as with almost everything in life, it’s important to get a good start. At the beginning of our emotional development, as newborn infants, the part of the brain responsible for emotions – the limbic brain – is completely unregulated. Newborns don’t come into the world knowing how to behave; they need their mothers to teach them. Through their mother's influence, babies build their emotional prototype – their ideal – which will then help to shape any further emotional experiences they will have. Imagine, for example, a toddler staggering across the grass of a park. Suddenly, he loses his balance and falls. At this point, the toddler checks his mother's face: if she expresses alarm or concern, the toddler will start to cry. If, on the other hand, her face expresses amusement, the toddler may smile or even laugh with her. The stability of this connection between parent and child is crucial for the youngster’s development. Indeed, it’s the basis of the emotional intelligence the child needs to empathize with others – in other words, gaining an intuitive understanding of the other's emotion and responding to it. But this “limbic regulation” is not only for the young. Because we remain social creatures throughout our lives, adults also require emotional stabilization from outside. While, as adults, we may think that our being so dependent on external feedback is a weakness, it’s actually a source of our power. Our continued ability to connect with other people enables us to modify the emotional Attractors in our brains, allowing us to grow and change emotionally. Without this ability to continually influence our limbic brain into old age, we’d all behave like big kids! All we require are stable, trusting and healthy connections with others, the kind that can be found in our close relationships, such as with our romantic partners or close friends. As we have seen, our feelings of attachment depend to a large degree on our childhood. The relationships we experienced during childhood shape our emotional brain, which strongly influences our adult relationships. If the people (usually parents) who influenced the development of our limbic prototypes were, during our childhood, themselves not emotionally developed, nor aware of their own emotional shortcomings, we’ll inherit their emotional problems. This is how our emotional programming gets passed down the generations. So, how can we break the pattern? One way to deal with such unfavorable programming is psychotherapy. To see why psychotherapy can be effective, let’s take another look at Attractors. Our Attractors determine our experience. Imagine you have to wear spectacles that allow you to only see green. Everything in your life will be, in one way or another, tinged by and limited to green. In much the same way, the Attractors in your limbic system are shaping and limiting your emotions – an influence that determines your choice of friends and romantic partners. Yet if our relationships with those close to us during our childhood aren’t stable, we may end up with shoddy programming. Fortunately, through psychotherapy, it is possible to reprogram our emotional brain. This is achieved by altering the network of Attractors in the brain. Although psychotherapists often disagree vehemently on the most effective approach, disputing each other’s theories and methods, the particular approach taken is of relatively little consequence. What does matter is that the therapist is able to modify the patient’s network of Attractors – a process called limbic revision. When psychotherapy is successful, it’s because it has assisted the patient in revising his or her limbic patterns – it has widened the color spectrum beyond green, so to speak – to the degree that the patient is able to begin choosing friends and partners who are better suited to him or her. The English poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning once wrote: \"Whoso loves believes the impossible.\" Though Browning captured the essence of what it means to be in love, let’s try to be more specific: When we’re in love, we experience three related feelings. First, we’re so enraptured by the way our partner fits so perfectly with us that we believe we’ll never fall for another person. Of course, we are able to fall in love more than just once in our lives. But what’s important is the subjective feeling that this person is “the one.” Second, there’s the strong desire to be physically close to that person. When this desire diminishes, we begin to doubt our love. Finally, there’s the irresistible urge to ignore anything that has nothing to do with our experience of being in love. In this way, the experience of being in love is basically a “rewriting” of reality. As this suggests, there’s a huge difference between being in love and loving. Falling in love is crucial for bringing two people together romantically. But it’s no more than a prelude to loving (which, as we’ll see in the next blink, is all about long-term attachment). Therefore, it’s inevitable that the period of being in love – the “honeymoon period” – will come to an end. Nevertheless, because the feeling of being in love is so profound, it leads us to believe that the relationship and the feeling will last forever. So, when it does ultimately end we are extremely disappointed, saddened and even depressed. Unfortunately, through an incessant stream of TV shows, romantic comedies, romance novels and so on, our culture perpetuates the misleading ideal that love is eternal. Typically, such stories follow this schema: two characters, who know very little about each other, fall in love over a very short period, and – after overcoming some obstacle to their relationship – they end up together. Because this story schema is so prevalent in our culture, we have come to believe that it’s the ideal version of love – which is why we are so disappointed and surprised when we realize (perhaps again and again) that love is fleeting. As we saw in the previous blink, when we take the feeling of being in love as the essence of loving itself, we’re inevitably disappointed. But what is at the heart of the difference between being in love and loving? The fundamental difference is in the emotional connection. While we can be in love with a person who is not in love with us, loving is always mutual. Each person attunes him- or herself to the other, and modulates their personality and behavior to fit the other. Moreover, adult love means knowing each other deeply. By contrast, all that’s required to fall in love is that you’re acquaintances who’ve known each other for a short time. Therefore, loving needs time and arises from long-term intimacy, as the loving persons have to become accustomed to the details of each other’s soul. Through the creation of such profound love relationships, over time both people become “limbically attuned” to each other. Why? The reason is simple: as we have seen, good psychotherapists enable the patient to revise established structures in their limbic brain. And for that, patient and therapist must establish a limbic connection. Yet, between people who love each other, such a connection is already in place. Indeed, both partners are in a constant limbic exchange. The networks between their respective Attractors are transformed and a shared way of sensing the world emerges, manifest in the brain structures of the loving persons. From this literal transformation of the Attractors comes the expression that people often say when they lose a partner: “A part of me is gone.” The key message in this book: How we experience the world emotionally is a kind of neural programming that we learn during childhood. If we want to change this programming, we need to nurture profound empathic relations with others – not only with friends and romantic partners, but also psychotherapists. Actionable advice: Learn to separate loving from being in love. If you find that you’re consistently surprised when a romantic relationship ends, it’s time for some serious reflection. For the longest time, through movies, novels, TV shows, etc., Western culture has taught us to confuse the feeling of being in love with loving. Since this leads to disappointment when the “honeymoon period” comes to an end, it’s important to reflect on the kind of “story” you’re telling yourself about a particular relationship. If you notice that your story is about eternal love, you have to remind yourself that romantic love is fleeting.

    "title": "A Life Decoded",
    "author": "J. Craig Venter",
    "summary": "One of the biggest scientific achievements of the modern era must be that of free-spirited American J. Craig Venter: the deciphering of the human genome. But what makes a person take on such an immense task? How did he grow up to become so relentlessly ambitious, and what fueled his ongoing motivation right up to the amazing breakthrough and beyond? These blinks tell the tale of how Venter’s life unfolded – from a childhood full of playful creativity, to his rebellious attitude and meteoric rise within the scientific community. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a shark attack saved Venter’s life; why identifying human genes quickly made him a center of controversy; and which amazing aquatic task Venter took on after deciphering the human genome. Among J. Craig Venter’s most vivid memories from his early childhood is his freedom. Born in 1946, Venter grew up in Millbrae, a small town 15 miles south of San Francisco, California. During his childhood, his parents would often just tell him to “go play.” With this liberty, Venter first discovered three lasting personal traits. As a young boy, Venter loved taking risks and facing challenges. One of his favorite destinations was the local airport, San Francisco International Airport, where he would watch the planes taking off and landing. In the ‘50s, the airport was very different from how it is today: there was no security, no cameras and no wired fences. Together with his friends, Venter came up with the idea to race the airplanes on the runway. They’d wait until a plane started to taxi in preparation for its ascent, and then they would jump onto their bikes to race it for as long and as far as they could. Pilots occasionally notified the control tower, which then dispatched the airport police. But because the runway was such a long way from the terminal, the boys could always escape easily. Another key trait that became apparent early on was Venter’s insatiable urge to build things. Venter’s efforts at construction were modest at the beginning, mostly small but elaborate tunnels and forts. School curriculums were never among Venter’s interests or strengths – he wanted to do something practical. So, in the seventh grade he built an electronic scoreboard for the junior high school baseball field. In his woodworking class, instead of making furniture, he built a complex hydroplane, a motorboat based on a new design that had set a speed record of 60 mph. The young Venter would do anything to get his hands on the material he needed to build things from scratch. In 1967, at the age of 20, Venter could not avoid being sent to Vietnam. But because an IQ test revealed a respectable score of 142, he was given the option to go to hospital corps school. This allowed Venter to avoid combat missions and serve as a corpsman, an enlisted member of the military medical unit, instead. Practicing medicine at the Navy hospital in Da Nang, Vietnam, gave Venter a number of medical skills. Venter was a senior corpsman in the intensive care ward where he looked after victims of mines, bullets and napalm. Later, he joined the dermatology and infectious disease clinic, where he dealt with a range of disorders, from malaria to tumors and venereal diseases – the latter almost an epidemic among soldiers in Vietnam due to widespread prostitution. Venter also treated children at a local orphanage in Da Nang. He dealt with everything from pregnancies to insect infestations, major wounds to broken bones. His experiences in the Vietnam War taught him a lot about just how vulnerable humans are. Venter had seen several hundred soldiers die, often while he was massaging their hearts or attempting to breathe life into them. Badly wounded patients who survived showed him the impact of spirit and willpower on one’s survival. This difficult job eventually took its toll on Venter; after five months in Vietnam, he was determined to take his own life. He tried to escape the horror by swimming away in the ocean, planning to become so exhausted that he’d drown. But instead, he was attacked by a shark, and ended up swimming back to shore. Vietnam was the starting point for Venter’s scientific drive to understand life. Having experienced the fragility of life, Venter wanted to understand the very essence of it. After having seen the darkest depths of mind, body and soul in Vietnam, Venter put all his efforts into his own education. Given his lackluster academic record, Venter returned to school in early 1969 and enrolled in classes at the college of San Mateo. His hard work at school paid off: he received straight As in all three semesters and was accepted to the University of California, San Diego, to study biochemistry. Venter soon made his start in research, publishing his findings in scientific journals. Due to his excellent academic performance and his unusual medical background, Venter caught the attention of the distinguished biochemist Nathan O. Kaplan, a leading enzymologist. Kaplan encouraged Venter to come up with an idea for a research project. Venter wanted to study the “fight or flight” response caused by adrenaline. One theory was that adrenaline worked inside human cells; Venter, however, was able to prove that it actually worked on the cell surface. While still an undergraduate student, Venter submitted a paper on his findings in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. In his two years of graduate study, Venter completed and published eleven more papers in quality journals – much more than most doctoral students manage in five years. In 1975, Venter earned a PhD in biochemistry. It was during this time that he was also introduced to the scientific community. During his university career, Venter was astonished by the high caliber of the scientists with whom he was working. Whenever Kaplan’s famous friends visited the university, he would host a party and invite Venter to meet great names in science such as Carl and Gerty Cori (Nobel Prize winners in 1947), Ephraim Katzir (a biochemist and former president of Israel) or William McElroy, the university chancellor. To launch the next phase of his career, Venter chose the State University of New York in Buffalo, where he was offered a postdoctoral junior faculty position. But when he was refused a permanent position, Venter decided to leave Buffalo. In 1983, he was offered the chance to continue his research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the powerhouse of medical research in America. This offer would come to change Venter’s life and the course of his scientific research. At the NIH, Venter moved into molecular biology and entered the emerging field of genomics –  the branch of molecular biology that looks at genes. It was there that Venter found himself in scientific heaven. He had been given hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up and equip his laboratory and had an annual budget of over $1 million. The NIH campus was also home to hundreds of the nation’s finest researchers, with whom he could collaborate. At the NIH, Venter wrote the first molecular biology paper of his career: he and his team had found a gene responsible for the recognition of adrenaline. With his entry into genomics, Venter also came across the idea of decoding the entire human genome. Genes are regions of the DNA, which itself stores all biological information. Decoding or sequencing a gene means determining the precise order of the chemical building blocks from which the gene is built. Venter had spent about a decade decoding the one single adrenaline receptor gene of what was at the time estimated to be 100,000 human genes. It’s therefore easy to imagine that the idea of decoding the entire human genome was considered impossible by most scientists at the time. But Venter was immediately drawn to the thought of having a database showing the sequence of every human gene. Venter had become fascinated by the idea of unraveling the secrets of the human genome – the entire genetic material of the human organism. But when he made a breakthrough that he thought could change genomic science, he suddenly found himself at the center of a heated controversy. At the NIH, Venter developed a technique to rapidly identify human genes. This technique detects so called Expressed Sequence Tags, or ESTs, which are short fragments of DNA that can be used to draw inferences about genes. Venter became a controversial scientist when he attempted to patent newly identified genes. Venter was convinced that his approach was of incredible value for gene discovery and the understanding of the human genome. Together with the NIH, Venter decided to attempt to patent the genes he identified on basis of the ESTs. This attempt unleashed a great wave of criticism, instantly making Venter a divisive figure in the scientific community. His critics complained that Venter was attempting a wholesale patenting of human genes, which, they believed, shouldn’t be patented at all. The New York Times quoted one researcher as saying that Venter’s approach was a ”quick and dirty land grab.” When Venter felt too little support for his genomic research efforts, he left the NIH and continued his research at a private institute. Venter left the NIH in 1992. He wanted to scale up genomics to realize the potential of the EST method without being held back by government bureaucracy at the NIH. He then received an offer from Human Genome Sciences (HGS), a company that was willing to fund his research and market his discoveries. This allowed him to set up his own research institute, which he called The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). However, other researchers began to fear the possibility that the human genome could be locked up and owned by private investors. On his way to deciphering of the human genome, Venter had a noteworthy success: he was the first to decode the genome of a living species. Venter had developed a new method to decode a genome. He called this method “shotgun sequencing,” since it worked by fragmenting a genome into thousands of fragments of DNA that could then be analyzed more easily. But would this method work when attempting to decode something as complex as the whole human genome? To find out, Venter needed a testing ground. He chose to decode the genome of the bacterium H.influenzae to see whether the shotgun sequencing method was appropriate. It was: in 1995, Venter successfully decoded the entire H.influenzae genome. It was a historic moment. Venter had become the first to decipher the entire genetic code of a living species – but he didn’t stop there. The deciphering of the H.influenzae genome was a great success, but Human Genome Sciences (HGS), which was expected to fund Venter’s research, became increasingly unwilling to give financial support. Conflicts about Venter’s right to publish his findings arose since HGS wanted to capitalize them. Even before the deciphering of the human genome could get started, Venter terminated the relationship with HGS. Venter, however, got another chance to decode the human genome. He was approached with an offer to build Celera, a new subsidiary of the American biotech company PerkinElmer. Celera would aim to provide a high-quality database of the complete human genome to aid scientific discovery. But Celera would eventually come to compete with the publicly-financed Human Genome Project (HGP) in its effort to decode the human genome. In 2000, Celera and the HGP jointly announced to have successfully decoded the entire human genome, with Venter at the very center of this amazing achievement. June 26, 2000 was probably the most important day in Venter’s life. At the White House, he met president Bill Clinton and told the world that long years of scientific research efforts had come to a successful end. On that fateful day, Venter and Francis Collins of the Human Genome Project (HGP) jointly announced the deciphering of the entire human genome at the White House. Parallel to Venter’s research efforts at Celera, the HGP had also aimed to decode the human genome. Many of the HGP’s researchers, however, didn’t believe that Venter’s technique of shotgun sequencing was really appropriate for the human genome. But the race was declared to be over when Venter and Collins were together invited to the White House to announce their historic scientific achievement, alongside US President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Although Venter and his team had always considered themselves to be ahead of the HGP, they felt relieved that the race was over. The audience at the White House in June 2000 was made up of prominent politicians as well as the leading contributors within the genome community. Recognition for the scientific success came thick and fast. Venter went to Saudi Arabia to receive the King Faisal International Prize for Science, and to Vienna to receive the World Health Award from former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. Venter received a multitude of honorary degrees from top universities around the world and was given the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize. From Japan came the Takeda award, and from Canada the Gairdner Award, both notable prizes in science. So what comes after such a great success? In the final blink, find out where Venter found a new scientific purpose. After deciphering the human genome, Venter found himself in search of a new purpose. He turned his attention to a project that combined two great loves of his life: science and sailing. Venter now devotes his scientific efforts to reading the ocean’s genome. Knowing that the billions of tons of carbon dioxide that we are pumping into the atmosphere each year are altering global climate patterns, it was clear to Venter that modern life will eventually become unsustainable. But he wanted to do more than just use less oil and gas, or install a solar panel. He felt that genomics had something unique to offer. Venter figured that he needed to work out exactly what is in the oceans to accurately assess the effects of climate change, such as ocean acidification. So he embarked on a project to take seawater and analyze the genetic material of all the microorganisms swimming in it. The idea was to obtain a snapshot of the microbial diversity in a single drop of seawater. Venter has since discovered tens of thousands of new species, many of them strange and exotic. In all, he has discovered more than 1.3 million new genes in only 200 liters of surface seawater. Furthermore, Venter works on the development of synthetic biological organisms. Could we design new organisms to live in the emission-control system of a coal-fired plant to soak up its carbon dioxide? Or could we harness microbes and their biochemistry to alter the atmosphere? Venter currently works on the creation of synthetic organisms that could help clean up our polluted environment. In 2006, Venter founded the J. Craig Venter Institute, one of the largest private research institutes in the world with over five hundred scientists and staff and an annual budget of over $70 million. The key message in this book: Already as a child, J. Craig Venter loved facing challenges. After being confronted with the fragility of human life in the Vietnam War, Venter devoted his scientific efforts to one of the greatest challenges that science had to offer: deciphering the human genome, and thus understanding of the very essence of life. In 2000, Venter was among the first group of scientists to decode the entire human genome. Actionable advice: Let curiosity lead you. J. Craig Venter’s life is a perfect example of how great achievements can stem from nothing more than natural curiosity. As a child, Venter was curious as to whether he could race airplanes or whether he could build a functioning hydroplane. His scientific career was always driven by his curiosity to understand life in its every detail. So, keep your natural curiosity alive and try to follow it. Don’t be discouraged by systems or people that try to keep your thinking inside the box!

    "title": "A Mind for Numbers",
    "author": "Barbara Oakley",
    "summary": "Do numbers make your head spin, and equations freak you out? Barbara Oakley hated and sometimes even failed her math and science courses throughout school, but after graduating, she found that she needed these skills to pursue her dream career. In A Mind for Numbers, Oakley, now a professor in engineering, shares easily applicable methods and fun tricks for excelling at math and science. You’ll also learn why napping and letting your mind wander facilitates learning; that planning play time is as important as planning work time; and why you wouldn’t necessarily want to be a genius. Imagine a flashlight with two settings: it can intensely focus its beam on one small area, or it can spread its light less powerfully, but more broadly. Our brains work in a similar way. They can switch between two kinds of networks or functions. First, there’s the focused mode. This is when we concentrate on information that’s already tightly embedded in our minds. We usually use the focused mode for concepts we already find familiar or comfortable. Focused mode thinking is essential for studying math and science. We use it to direct our attention to solving problems using rational and analytical thought. For example, you use focused mode thinking when you multiply numbers (assuming you already know how to multiply). If you’re studying a language, you might use it to incorporate the verb conjugation you learned last week. Our second way of thinking is diffuse mode thinking. Diffuse mode is what happens when you relax your attention and let your mind wander a bit. We use it to get a “big picture” understanding of something. Diffuse mode is also important for learning math and science. It allows you to gain new insights into problems you’ve been struggling with. When trying to understand something new, it’s better to not focus on one thing. Use your “big picture” diffuse mode of thinking instead. Consider this sentence: Thiss sentence contains threee errors. The first two errors – in spelling – are easily noticeable when using a focused approach. But the third error? The third error – that the sentence is untrue because there is no third error – only becomes clear when we use the diffuse approach to consider the sentence more abstractly. Focused and diffuse thinking both have their purposes. As we go through our daily activities, we switch back and forth between the focused and diffuse modes. We’re in one or the other, but we’re never consciously in both at the same time. Switching between them is important for our learning process – it allows for understanding and problem solving. To tackle intellectual problems and learn new concepts, we almost always need periods of time when we aren’t consciously thinking about the issue. This is when we use our diffuse mode. Then, when we turn our attention back to the problem, we can consolidate the bigger-picture insights we’ve gained. When we learn, one mode of thinking processes the information it receives, then sends the results back to the other mode. This volleying back and forth of information is essential; it lets us work toward a solution. Sleep is also essential in learning. Think of it this way: you can’t make your muscles bigger by constantly lifting weights. They need time to rest before they’re used again. When you take time off in between weight-lifting sessions, you build strong muscles in the long run. The same goes for learning. We need periods of rest to refresh and reinvigorate our thinking. Toxic products are created in our brains when we’re awake for too long, and sleep clears them away. Sleep keeps our brain healthy, so it’s a vital part of learning and memory. Also, research has shown that if we review learning material right before sleep, there’s a higher chance we’ll dream about it, and dreaming about it can enhance our understanding. So if you get frustrated with something, try switching your mode of thinking, or taking a nap. The human mind has extraordinary capacities. Did you know you have an innate ability to see forests, so your mind doesn’t have to process each individual tree? This mental ability is called chunking. It’s an important part of learning, and we use it in our first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science. Chunks are pieces of information that are connected by their common meaning. For example, we can take the letters p, o, and p and put them together into one conceptual chunk: the word pop. Chunking information helps the brain run more efficiently. Once we chunk an idea or concept, we don’t need to remember each underlying detail or tree – we’ve got the main meaning. As we learn, we build a chunked, mental library of concepts we can go through. When we’re trying to solve puzzles, we train our brains to not just recognize specific problems, but different types and classes of problems as well. This helps us solve them much more quickly. While learning, you can keep the chunking process going by recalling the material you’re trying to learn. Recall is when you mentally retrieve the main ideas of your learning material. It helps build new chunks of information. The best way to build chunks is to focus your attention on understanding the basic ideas, then practice going over them. Remember that you also need to understand them in the context of other information you already know. You can’t understand a math problem just by looking at the solution. If you really want to understand it, you have to knit the concepts of it into the web of concepts and chunks you already have in your brain. So when you’re studying, don’t just passively reread information – practice recalling it. This will force you to work your way through problems and solve them. Imagine how much pain your calf muscles would be in if you didn’t practice for a big marathon until the night before. Similarly, if you procrastinate, you can’t compete in math and science, either. Procrastination is tempting, and it’s important to prevent it. It’s something we can all easily succumb to, because it offers temporary relief from an unappealing present. We procrastinate on things that are boring, difficult, or make us feel uncomfortable. If you want to go far in math and science, you’ve got to take control of your procrastination. Think of learning math and science this way: you need brief study sessions where you lay “bricks” of information, and time in between for them to dry. In other words, your learning process needs to be spread out over a long period of time. You can’t learn it quickly at the last minute. You can prevent procrastination by focusing on the process, rather than the product, of your learning. The process is the ongoing time you spend doing something – it happens when you say “I’m going to study for the next 20 minutes.” The product is the outcome. It could be a homework assignment that you finish, for example. When you focus on the process of learning, you’ll relax and go with the flow of your work. You won’t judge yourself as much, because you’ll be less focused on quickly getting the end result. This also helps prevent procrastination. Sometimes, a product is so challenging to reach that we avoid trying to reach it. We don’t try because we’re uncomfortable with the difficulty, or we fear failure. That’s a kind of procrastination. As you get better at focusing on the process, you won’t just find it easier to avoid procrastination – you’ll also enjoy learning more. The management specialist David Allen once said, “To a great degree, the highest-performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives.” There are many simple but effective mental tricks you can use when learning. First, you can try putting yourself in a new environment. Figure out where you’re most productive. Some people need a busy coffee shop, while others need a quiet library. However, research has shown that having a special place devoted to working is particularly helpful for fending off procrastination. Mindfulness training is also a good idea. Mindfulness training is like meditation – it means ignoring distracting thoughts by letting them drift past without paying attention to them. You can meditate by doing things like counting down numbers. Focusing on counting relaxes you, and trains your mindfulness. Finally, try reframing your focus. Reframing your focus means shifting your attention from something negative to something positive. It helps you adjust your attitude. For example, if you have trouble getting up in the morning, don’t think about how tired you are – think about how good your breakfast will be. One of the most effective learning tricks is keeping reasonable, achievable to-do lists. This helps you gain control of your habits. So write a brief to-do list once a week, or even every day. You’ll be able to step back, look at the bigger picture, and set your priorities. Keeping a planner journal can also help keep you on track. And when scheduling your time, remember: “play” is just as important as work. Planning for “play” also helps you avoid procrastination, because it will take away your reasons to do it. We learn and recall information much more easily when the information is meaningful to us. This means your memorization process can become an exercise in creativity. Suppose you want to remember Newton’s second law: f = ma. This law relates force to mass and acceleration. The letter f could stand for flying, m for mule and a for whatever comes to your creative mind (apples?)! So if you want your mule to start flying faster, you have to feed it more apples. One of the best memorization techniques is creating metaphors. A metaphor lets you see how one thing is similar to another. For example, if you’re trying to understand electrical currents, it helps to visualize them as water. You can imagine the voltage as pressure on that water. Metaphors help cement ideas in your mind, because they connect them to structures that are already there. The more connections you build, the easier it’ll be to recall concepts and what they mean. It’s often helpful to pretend you are the concept you’re trying to understand. You can imagine yourself as an electron, or that you’re inside the x of an algebraic equation. Acronyms are another useful tool in memorization. They help you simplify your learning material. Imagine you want to remember four plants – garlic, rose, hawthorn and mustard. The first letters of each word abbreviate to GRHM, so you can visualize a GRAHAM cracker. In fact, academics in many disciplines use memorable sentences, which are a kind of acronym. In memorable sentences, the first letter of each word is also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized. These sentences can form a story, and the meaning of that story makes it easier to retain the information. It can be intimidating to work alongside other people, especially if they understand new concepts more quickly than you. However, “average” students sometimes have advantages when it comes to work ethic and creativity. Gifted people often have their own set of challenges to face. For one, smarter people often have a longer working memory. This is the part of our memory that handles whatever we’re immediately and consciously processing in our mind. However, a strong working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts can’t easily get through. This sometimes leads smart people to overthink simple problems and overlook simple solutions. Research has shown that smart people have a higher tendency to lose themselves in complex thoughts, so they may have trouble focusing. Practice and persistence are often more important than intelligence. Practice cements memories into our long-term memory. This is where thoughts are stored, so they can be accessed later. Unlike high-powered working memories, average working memories don’t lock everything in so tightly, so they can get more input from other areas of the brain, like our long-term memory. These other areas are often the source of creative ideas. So the memory connections we build by practice help us become more creative. Persistence in learning allows us to go deeply into a problem. It also improves our ability to think independently, and leads us to reach out and ask the right questions for getting the right answers. Even people with average intelligence can achieve the same mental feats as those who are “naturally” gifted, if they work hard and practice diligently. Testing isn’t just about measuring how much we know. It’s an extraordinarily powerful learning experience in itself. Studying and preparing for exams are highly important. Testing improves our ability to retain what we’ve learned. It doesn’t merely assess learning, it facilitates it. This is called the testing effect. In 2009, two psychologists named Julie Campbell and Richard Meyer conducted research into the testing effect. In their study, two groups of participants watched a PowerPoint presentation of information they had to learn. One group was given a multiple choice question after every few slides, so they had to recall what they’d just seen. When the participants were given an exam at the end, the ones who’d been tested continually as the presentation went on performed better, because of the testing effect. In fact, it’s been shown that the testing effect still occurs even when the test performance is bad, or no feedback is given. Testing also helps us deal with stress or anxiety. The body puts out chemicals like cortisol when it’s under stress. This can cause sweaty palms or a racing heart. This sounds like a bad thing, but research has found that the way we interpret these symptoms makes a big difference. If you shift your thinking from “This test makes me afraid” to “This test makes me excited to do my best, and that’s why I feel this adrenalin,” it can significantly improve your performance. If you’re feeling panicky before a test, it’s also good to momentarily turn your attention to breathing. Deep breathing sends more oxygen to critical areas in the brain. If you practice these techniques, you’ll get better at dealing with stress or anxiety in exams, and you’ll be able to channel it into productivity. All in the all, testing is very useful in learning. The key message in this book: With diligence and hard work, anyone can improve their understanding of math and science. So recall your learning material, and focus on the process of your learning. Even if it’s challenging at first, you’ll be able to achieve great things. Actionable advice: Take breaks. Don’t forget: you have to build your math and science skills slowly, like muscles. So rest in between your study sessions, and be sure to get enough sleep. That’s more effective in the long run.

    "title": "A Planet of Viruses",
    "author": "Carl Zimmer",
    "summary": "Every year an influenza epidemic sweeps across the world, leaving hundreds of millions sniffling and coughing in its wake. Although it kills a number of people every year, there are far worse and far deadlier viruses around. The last Ebola outbreak killed thousands, and it could have been a whole lot worse. In our globalized world, viruses can spread farther and faster than ever before. But are viruses all bad? If they can do so much harm to us, maybe they can also keep other dangers in check? In these blinks, you’ll learn why the Romans rubbed their faces with mice; how viruses save lives; and why Ebola is so hard to eradicate. The common cold is a relatively harmless, but rather annoying sickness we’re all forced to deal with now and again. Our parents had it, our great-grandparents had it, and even our most ancient ancestors had to deal with fevers, coughs and runny noses. The common cold is typically caused by the rhinovirus, a virus that was a nuisance to the Ancient Egyptians too. In the 3,500-year-old medical text Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian scholar documents the symptoms of “resh,” including a persistent cough and excess mucus in the nose. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? While the symptoms of the common cold in ancient times match what we see today, methods of treatment have changed considerably. Egyptians were given a rather sensible prescription of herbs, incense and honey to apply around the nose, whereas the Romans were convinced that rubbing a mouse around their nose was the best way to defeat the sniffles! History also provides us with a range of wildly different explanations for the common cold. Ancient Greeks chalked it up to an imbalance of the four bodily fluids, i.e., blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm. Seems rather unbelievable now, but the common cold’s cause eluded physicians even up to 1900, when physiologist Leonard Hill posited that colds were caused by moving from hot air to cold air, the way you might do when taking a morning walk. Fortunately, scientific research from the early to mid-twentieth century helped uncover the true cause of the common cold. We now know that the rhinovirus is responsible. So do we know how to defeat it? Despite centuries of experimenting with different remedies for the common cold, we still lack a fool-proof cure. The answer may lie in attacking the genetic code of the virus. But it’s worth asking whether we should bother finding a cure in the first place. After all, the rhinovirus and other harmless viruses teach our immune systems to react appropriately to benign infections, making it better able to deal with viruses that are serious threats to our health. What are these deadly viruses? That’s what we’ll find out in the next blink. Influenza, or the flu, is another viral infection we’re all familiar with and that has plagued humans for centuries. Today, we know a lot more about influenza than we did in the past. And yet, we still struggle to find a reliable cure for this sickness, which can be deadly. The influenza virus works by destroying the protective membrane lining a person’s airways, making them susceptible to pathogens present in the air they breathe. This in turn can lead to fatal lung infections. Up to 50 million people died as a result of influenza during the 1918 global flu epidemic. Even this year the flu is likely to kill between 250,000 to 500,000 people. What is it that makes influenza so dangerous? For starters, it’s not just one virus. There are many different types of flu viruses, and they are constantly shifting, evolving and swapping genes with each other. It’s rather hard to create a cure for a virus that never stays the same! The way that influenza spreads also adds to its deadliness. Influenza viruses are typically carried by birds and usually don’t spread to other species. But when it does happen, the results can be disastrous. During the 2009 H1N1 “Swine Flu” pandemic, three forms of bird flu virus infected pig populations, eventually combining with each other to form one deadly super virus, which in turn joined with a pig flu virus that made it possible for humans to contract the sickness. Frighteningly enough, we simply can’t know when a new strain will travel from birds to humans. But we aren’t completely helpless in the face of the flu. Even the simplest habits, such as washing our hands, significantly reduces the risk of influenza. Would you believe that some viruses are actually good for you? If not, it’s time to take a closer look at the biology of a particular kind of virus: bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, or “phages” for short, are viruses that have the power to cure diseases. How? They eat bacteria. Bacteriophages were discovered and named by Canadian-born doctor Felix d’Herelle while studying the feces of French soldiers suffering from dysentery in WWI. By filtering the stool samples, d’Herelle was able to isolate the bacteria Shigella that caused the illness. And, he noticed that in some places, the Shigella was being destroyed by none other than an additional virus. After testing the virus on himself, he used it to treat his patients. Despite this, the idea of injecting live viruses into patients made many doctors uncomfortable. By 1940, phages were superseded by antibiotics in the treatment of diseases. Today, phages have another important role in our world: as protectors of the water. Every liter of seawater is home to about 100,000,000,000 viruses. Add up all the liters of water in the ocean and that’s a whole lot of viruses – roughly 10^30! Luckily, marine phages make up part of this virus population. Phages destroy between 15 and 20 percent of nasty ocean bacteria each day, which prevents cholera and other harmful illnesses from spreading. Without phages, water-borne illnesses would wreak a lot more havoc. Aside from phages, there’s another form of virus that has been a big help. Endogenous retroviruses are viruses generated within the bodies of animals, including humans. These viruses insert their genetic information into the DNA of the host. When the host’s cells divide, the DNA of the virus is also replicated, thus shaping our genes. One important endogenous retrovirus is HERV-W, discovered in 1999 by Jen-Luc Blond among others. One of the genes of this virus produces syncytin, a protein essential for the bonding of cells in the outer layer of the placenta. In other words, without this retrovirus, we wouldn’t be able to carry children. In this way, we can thank viruses for the survival of our species! Scientific knowledge of viruses is constantly developing. Can this tell us anything about the role of viruses in our future? Take HIV for instance. Since it was discovered in the 1980s, 60 million people have contracted the virus, and nearly 30 million died as a result. HIV works by fusing the host’s immune cells together, inserting its DNA and multiplying at an incredible rate. In its efforts to fight off the virus, the immune system is weakened, making the host susceptible to dangerous diseases such as pneumonia. Research into HIV-1, the most infectious strain, has lead scientists to one compelling hypothesis. It’s likely that HIV-1 was carried by monkeys in Cameroon. The strain was contracted by monkey-eating hunters in isolated villages. It wasn’t until the arrival of colonial settlers in the early twentieth century that the virus really began to take hold. Investigating the history of HIV has allowed scientists to retrace the evolution of HIV, which in turn allows them to uncover weaknesses in the virus’s structure. It also helps to look to the past when investigating viruses because, like it or not, history tends to repeat itself. Mosquito-borne viruses are a prime example. People contracted the West Nile virus via mosquito bites, causing encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) to develop, leading to fever, paralysis and even fatality. This virus traveled from the Eastern Hemisphere to the United States with the birds that carried it, and was then spread by mosquitoes that carried the virus from birds to humans in North America. The West Nile case is likely to repeat itself with different mosquito-borne viruses. North American birds have proven to be good carriers of the West Nile virus, and mosquitoes will continue to thrive as the US climate becomes warmer and wetter. Researchers must keep this in mind and learn from mistakes made during the West Nile case to combat viruses more effectively in the future. Advancement in modern medicine allows us to be more effective at fighting viruses than ever before. But how safe are we really? The problem is that we simply can’t predict when a virus such as Ebola will take root. The first outbreak of the disease took place in 1976 in Guinea, where nightmarish symptoms such as violent vomiting, explosive, bloody diarrhea and even bleeding from the eyes caused the deaths of 318 sufferers. Since then, Ebola has reemerged several times, most recently in December 2013. And, these outbreaks cover more and more ground. In 1976, the virus traveled only between remote villages, and infected relatively fewer people. Since then, the susceptible regions of Guinea and Liberia have become increasingly connected to the rest of the globe. This allows the virus to travel rapidly, making it trickier to quarantine and more likely to infect and kill individuals. The December 2013 outbreak left more than 10,000 people dead. Between outbreaks, dangerous viruses including Ebola disappear from human populations. But they continue to circulate and develop among wild animals. It is not possible to know ahead of time when these viruses will make the jump and infect humans. Our inability to predict the behavior of viruses isn’t the only factor that makes them a threat to our future. Our ability to synthesize these viruses means that they could be used in biological warfare in the future. Scientists are now able to sequence DNA from scratch, allowing them to rebuild relatively simple diseases such as polio after investigating their structure. Viruses such as smallpox were sampled for research purposes. Although it was ordered that all vials of smallpox were to be destroyed, it is possible that some are still intact. Smallpox, a complicated virus, is more difficult to sequence than polio, but the feat is certainly achievable. The calculated use of viruses as biological weapons would have devastating consequences for future generations on our planet. The key message in this book: Viruses have been a part of human life since ancient times. Although they can cause suffering, they also keep our environment safe. Through historical and scientific research, we know much more about viruses today than ever before. Still, we can’t predict when outbreaks will occur, and we can’t prevent their power being used for evil in biological warfare. Continued investigation into the frightening and fascinating world of viruses will ensure we’re prepared for the future. Actionable advice: Antibiotics will not cure the common cold. Why do people believe you can take antibiotics to treat a cold? The common cold is caused by a virus, not by bacteria, and antibiotics are only effective in combating bacteria. But sometimes antibiotics can cause bacteria to evolve into more resistant mutations. That means they won’t only get rid of your cold: they’ll put your body in danger by creating untreatable strains of bacteria.

    "title": "Age of Discovery",
    "author": "Ian Goldin, Chris Kutarna",
    "summary": "Are you feeling overwhelmed, stressed and disorientated? Maybe that’s because we are currently living in one of the most dynamic periods that human civilization has experienced in the past 500 years. The last of these eras of great economic and cultural expansion was the original Renaissance, which lasted from 1450 to 1550. It was a time of great discoveries and accomplishments, ranging from the development of the printing press to new forms of art that culminated in the masterpieces of Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci. Similar phenomena are happening today, from the development of international trade and exchange at an unprecedented level to the effect of the internet and new media on the exchange of information. In these blinks, you’ll learn how computer chips are changing the world we live in; that you know even more people on Facebook than you think; and why periods of progress are also periods of instability causing radicalism and violence. Just about everyone has heard of Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo. These famous artists created some of history’s most iconic masterpieces, and millions stand in line every year to see their work, which are landmarks of the incredible achievements of the Renaissance. But what exactly was the Renaissance? It was a period from about 1450 to 1550 during which supreme achievements of scientific and artistic genius were made. But it also had a dark side. The term Renaissance itself is controversial as it suggests something that is universally good. But in reality, the idea of “Renaissance Europe” was crafted by nineteenth-century European historians as a way to fortify the standing of European nations. This concept of European cultural superiority was then used to justify nineteenth-century European imperialism and colonialism across the globe. Despite the innovations made during this period by the likes of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, theologian Martin Luther and explorer Christopher Columbus, the Renaissance was also a time of great destruction and suffering. Diseases like smallpox were spread across oceans, practically exterminating the Aztecs, Incas and other Native Americans. Just like the Renaissance of the fifteenth century, our current New Renaissance has also been a time of great growth. The New Renaissance could be said to have started in 1990 with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. Commercial internet service began, and China stepped back into the world economy. The world suddenly felt very different, and historical data backs up that sensation. For example, the World Trade Organization or WTO, formed in 1995, is a powerful symbol of international economic advancement, cooperation and a radically different historical period. Today it numbers 161 members, representing every major economy in the world. However, just like the Renaissance of centuries past, this progress comes with a hefty bill. Just consider the catastrophic toll 30 years of unprecedented growth have had on the environment. Our world is practically unrecognizable from the one that existed a mere 25 years ago. Politics, the economy and society have all dramatically transformed, opening up stunning parallels between this modern transformation and the one that took place in the fifteenth century. For instance, centuries ago, the printing press revolutionized communication over the period of just a single lifetime. It began around 1450 when the German entrepreneur Johann Gutenberg (1395–1468) invented movable type. He used it to make the world’s first major printed book, Gutenberg’s Bible. Because of this breakthrough, a person born in the 1450s could look back on her fiftieth birthday to see that 15 to 20 million books had been printed during her lifetime. This number easily surpassed the number of books written since ancient Roman times by all European scribes combined. This hypothetical person would even have a difficult time remembering a world without books, although the generation before had relied solely on face-to-face conversations and handwritten manuscripts for communication. Similarly, the internet has transformed at an incredible speed the way people today interact with one another and the world. Since 1988, when the first intercontinental fiber-optic cables were installed, the number of users connected through this infrastructure has grown more than seven-fold. In 2000 it was 400 million; in 2005, it was one billion, and by 2015 it had reached three billion. The internet age marked easily the fastest mass adoption of a technology in the whole of human history, and one that radically connected all of humanity. Just think about it this way: if Facebook were a country, it would have a population of 1.5 billion, making it the largest nation on Earth. What’s more remarkable is the fact that two average users on this social network are less than four degrees of separation apart. Most people on Facebook know someone who knows someone who knows one of their friends. You can’t read the news today without getting a seriously dreary picture of the world. But is it really all doom and gloom? Actually, today, the quality of global health and wealth are at their highest level ever, even for the most disadvantaged populations on earth. Life expectancy has risen by almost two decades since 1960, climbing from 52 to 71 years. To put that in perspective, the last 20-year improvement in this metric took 1,000 years to achieve, not 50. As a result, a baby born today in practically any country can expect to live longer than at any previous point in that country’s history. Crushing poverty has also seen a dramatic improvement over the last 25 years. In 1990, something like two billion people were living below the World Bank’s international poverty line; by 2015, although the human population had grown by two billion, the total number of people living in extreme poverty on less than $1.25 per day had dropped by over half to just 900 million. This progress is the result of interconnected economies and improved medical care. The expansion of trade and the jobs it has created have helped raise the incomes of poor people. Competition has increased, which has, in turn, lowered the prices of goods and services while boosting their quality. As a result, small businesses and households on a budget have been empowered. During this time, technological advancements and better practices in public sanitation, clean water, hygiene, pest control, vaccines and drugs – along with growing public budgets to support them – have helped combat disease. In 1990, 13 million children under the age of five died from infectious diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, only 5.9 million children died from the same infections. The incredible accomplishments realized during the first Renaissance makes it seem like a magnificent cornucopia of progress. But we now know that wasn’t the case. In fact, there were clear signs that the progress attained during this period had disparate outcomes. While average welfare rose during much of the period, the wealth gap between rich and poor grew dramatically. Exact data from the first Renaissance is a bit patchy, but all the information that’s available points to a rise in income inequality alongside the expansion of manufacturing and trade. By 1550, in practically every Western European town of any decent size, the top 5 to 10 percent of residents owned between 40 and 50 percent of the town’s total wealth, while the bottom half owned little more than their own labor power. This phenomenon was primarily precipitated by falling wages on the lower half of the income scale. Such cuts were felt particularly acutely by women. Between 1480 and 1562, a nanny’s wages did not increase at all, yet the cost of her daily necessities rose by 150 percent. Outside Europe, matters were far worse. Some 150,000 Africans were enslaved between 1450 and 1550, and the European Age of Discovery meant the total destruction of entire civilizations in the Americas. Unsurprisingly, a polarity between rich and poor is also central to our current Renaissance. While average global welfare is rising, the extremes have grown even more distant. In 2010, the 388 richest people in the world controlled more wealth than the poorest 50 percent of the population. By 2015, this number dropped dramatically as just 62 people controlled more wealth than the bottom half. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent of society – some 3.6 billion people globally – subsist on an average of just a few dollars per day. In 1495, Italians began to experience horrific symptoms caused by a mystery disease. The victims of this ailment spat up blood and suffered from boils the size of breakfast rolls, which oozed dark green pus. The disease left people sick for months and sometimes years. What was it? Well, disease spread rampantly during the Renaissance, and we now know this particular affliction as syphilis. Within four years of its emergence, this sexually transmitted disease had spread all over Europe and was a global menace a mere five years later. The deadly advance of syphilis was facilitated by populations concentrated in urban centers. This urbanization created mutual interdependence, which did wonders for creativity and cultural exchange but also produced ideal conditions for the spread of disease. Given the similarities between then and now, you might have guessed that the modern world’s concentrated yet fluid populations produce comparable risks, not just for health, but also in other aspects of life. The massive rise in air travel neatly mimics the population exchange and economic linkages that enabled syphilis to spread throughout Europe and across the sea. A good example is the Ebola epidemic that broke out in December 2013 in West Africa. By March 2014, it had claimed 60 lives in Liberia and Sierra Leone; by mid-2015, over 28,000 cases had been reported, along with 11,300 deaths. And this was no accident. Such massive pitfalls appear regularly as side-effects of positive phenomena like rising global financial investments and the construction of the incredible infrastructure behind the internet. In fact, the interconnectivity of the modern world means that when something happens far away, it’s likely to rapidly become a problem at home. Just consider the 2008 financial crisis, which began in the United States but swiftly became a global issue. Or take cyber attacks: these data crimes can be committed anywhere in the world and prey on anybody, anywhere. As the world of the first Renaissance evolved at an astonishing rate, people often experienced fear, doubt and insecurities. This climate proved fertile ground for radical messages proclaiming doom and a need for extreme action. Just take Girolamo Savonarola, a Dominican friar who, in 1497, incited his fanatical followers to gather every piece of evidence they could find of their strange new age. They hunted out immoral books, nude paintings and sculptures, indecent perfumes, heretical texts and exotic musical instruments. They piled everything up in Florence’s central piazza and set it ablaze in what has become known as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Within a year of this spectacle, the friar became the most powerful figure in Florentine politics by launching a public campaign of moral purification that called for draconian laws prohibiting vice. His rapid ascent to power was mostly a product of good timing. After all, he was preaching his apocalyptic message as the year 1500 drew near – a year many Christians believed would bring the Last Judgment. Today radical messages of hate and extremism also pose a threat. Just take the rise of Islamic State, fringe Christian denominations that preach Islamophobia and homophobia, Orthodox Israeli Jews who assault gay people at pride parades and conceive plots to bomb Arab girls’ schools and, of course, the resurgence of neo-Nazi groups. All of these hate groups are examples of what can happen in a rapidly changing world marked by deepening inequality and general disorientation. So, the Renaissance wasn’t all great back then and it’s not all great now. But does that mean the future is bleak? As you’ll find out in the next blink, we have good reason to think the opposite. This comparison of ugly histories and current situations can be a bit frightening, but it’s essential to understand that even at times when the world as we know it might vanish down the drain, there’s still potential for tremendous good. Despite all the worrying developments, there’s also great progress being made today. While extremism and fear make it easy to be skeptical about the role of scientific and artistic advances in transforming the world, there’s good reason to believe in them. However, it’s difficult to measure this type of progress as the gains produced by acts of genius are often unquantifiable. The strength of innovations in the creation of wealth, health, art and justice is hard to measure in numbers. However, new technologies are still dramatically transforming the way we understand the world. Just remember, a mere 20 years ago, we thought Earth-like planets were rare. Today, because of better telescopes, computers and the thousands of astronomers who are linked together through the internet, we know that the Milky Way alone holds at least 10 billion other planets that are of the appropriate size, temperature and orbit to support life. This discovery has upgraded the possibility of alien life from remote to virtually certain. Or consider other intangible goods like those in the digital realm. If one million copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica were sold for $1,000 each, it would add $1 billion to GDP. Contrast that with the fact that when one million users log on to Wikipedia, no money is produced – although immeasurable good is still provided. Thanks to phenomena like Wikipedia, humanity is much better off in terms of time and money saved, even though GDP isn’t directly affected. And just about anyone can attest to the tremendous wealth of education and entertainment that can be gleaned from the internet without spending a penny. The key message in this book: The first Renaissance was a period of tremendous creativity and innovation, but also one of profound destruction and suffering. Today’s world is in many ways similar to the Renaissance of 500 years ago, and a historical perspective can shine a light on its intricacies. Got feedback?

    "summary": "Let’s take a second to think about that smartphone or tablet in front of you. How does it “think”? For instance, how does it “know” how to handle a heap of data and present it to you as the blinks you’re reading – or listening to – right now? The answer, of course, is that a series of instructions – or, in other words, an algorithm – enables it to do this. But, as you’ll learn from these blinks, it’s not only computers that use algorithms. They also play a part in your own thinking, in your gut feelings and decisions. And here’s the best part: when your own algorithms aren’t up to the task of solving a difficult problem in your life, you can turn to simple but powerful computer algorithms for help. In these blinks, you’ll learn how math can tell you when to stop dating and settle for the partner you’re with; how algorithms can help you sort your collection of zombie books; and why that mess on your desk isn’t half as bad as it looks. If you’re someone who tries to stay abreast of today’s technology, you probably already know that computers use algorithms all the time to solve problems. But you may have asked yourself, “What exactly is an algorithm?” The word actually dates back to the ninth century, when it was first used by the Persian mathematician Muhammad al-Khwarizmi. But the use of algorithms can be traced roughly four thousand years back, to the Sumerian civilization. Simply put, an algorithm is a finite series of steps that help solve a problem – and it’s a technique we use all the time. Even a recipe can be thought of as an algorithm: you follow a series of instructions to get the desired result, a delicious meal. The same can be said for the pattern you follow to knit a scarf or put together some Ikea furniture. And when you’re putting together a list of pros and cons to decide whether or not to accept a job offer or to make a big decision, you’re also following what’s known as an intuitive algorithm. By their very nature, the intuitive algorithms that humans use aren’t precise. We use them in times of uncertainty to make the best decision we can, like weighing the potential benefits against the risks of jumping into a new business investment. Therefore, these intuitive algorithms may seem rather subjective and random compared to the mathematical algorithms a computer uses, though they basically provide the same solution. Take the unpleasant task of apartment hunting. Most people go into this process with a set of criteria in mind: a minimum amount of space, a certain distance from school or work, a maximum amount of rent. When these conditions are met, that’s when you take the next step and sign the lease. This is essentially the same method that computer algorithms use, and in the next blinks we’ll explore how these methods can work for you. If you’ve been out searching for an apartment in a competitive market, you probably know how difficult it can be to decide when to take an offer and stop searching. Our judgment is often clouded by the first thing that comes along, which we tend to perceive as the best option available. And, just as easily, the second option can seem like the next best thing. These problems are exactly what the optimal stopping algorithm is designed to help solve. Mathematically speaking, if there are 100 options, optimal stopping says to look at the first 37 without taking any of them. Instead, look at them to establish a standard, such as excluding apartments that are on the ground floor and have small bathrooms. Then, after the first 37, you should jump on the first one that meets these standards. While this strategy doesn’t guarantee that you’ll end up with the best, these optimal odds are far better than just making a guess. And it doesn’t just apply to apartments; whether you’re looking for a car, a job or a potential mate, the magic number is always 37 percent. Unfortunately, math doesn’t always tell us the right time to stop. Let’s look at a simple coin flip. Say you want to bet on the outcome using the “triple or nothing” strategy, meaning you triple the bet with each flip but also risk losing everything you’ve won so far. So, if you start with four dollars, and your odds are 50/50, half the time you’ll end up with nothing and the other half with twelve dollars, so, on average, you’d expect to have six dollars in your pocket. In the next round, with a twelve-dollar starting bet, the odds stay the same, but you can expect to end up with eighteen dollars, and so on. With these odds and averages, pure mathematics would suggest that you keep on betting due to the increasing amount of money you can expect to win. But of course, sooner or later you’d lose everything and the game would be over. So, a purely mathematical algorithm doesn’t work in every situation. Let’s stick with gambling for a minute and look at one of the most popular games at any casino: the slot machine, or “one-armed bandit.” While some people are happy to sit at a single slot machine all day in the hopes of eventually hitting the jackpot, others prefer to explore their options, gather information and try to use it to their advantage. This same basic dilemma of how long to stick with a losing option before moving on applies to a number of situations in life, such as dating or investing. But what’s the winning strategy? In math, questions like this are called multi-armed bandit problems, and they have several different answers. The easiest approach to improving your odds at the slot machines is called “stay-win, lose-shift” – but it may not be the best strategy. All you have to do is stick with one machine as long as you’re winning and shift to another one once you lose. But this approach can be misleading since a one-time loss isn’t the best indicator of how your luck will turn out. A better method is the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm. Here’s how you use it: First, find the machine that offers the best expected value for playing. In this case, the only information you have is the jackpot counter, so you pick the one with the biggest jackpot. As you’re playing, keep track of the real outcome – in this case, how much money you’re winning – and note whether it’s gradually getting better or gradually getting worse than you’d expect. If the real outcome is continually disappointing you, that’s when you move to the next machine with the second biggest jackpot. And so on. Since this algorithm takes into account the fact that a good machine can still provide an occasional loss, it increases your chances of winning. Another source of inspiration for solving multi-armed bandit problems comes from adaptive clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry. When doctors are testing different drugs for an ailment, they continuously evaluate their subjects and make on-the-fly changes to their testing plan, even before the trial is over. If a drug doesn’t seem to be working, they will immediately put a stop to it and focus on other drugs that were helpful. They are always ready to exploit new information before the final results are even in. Do you ever feel like you can’t find anything you’re looking for once your desk or office gets cleaned up? Well, if you’re the kind of person who prefers a certain amount of organized chaos, then you’ll be happy to hear this next bit of advice. Don’t worry about always keeping everything neat and tidy. After all, the main reason to have everything sorted and in order is to make it easy to find something when you need it. And sorting through your stacks of paper can take a lot of time and energy that could be better spent doing other things, especially if you already know exactly where everything is! But let’s say your messy filing system is making you look like a hoarder and you want a better way to sort things out. Luckily for you, there are algorithms just for this. Let’s start with the least efficient method, the bubble sort. This works by organizing one pair of things at a time, over and over again, until everything is sorted out. Say you want to alphabetize your massive collection of books about zombies: First, you go to the area of your disorganized shelves where books beginning with A belong, look at the first two items that are already there and put those two in order. Now you might have “Albatross Zombies” followed by “Alligator Zombies.” Now move to the next book – “Aardvark Zombies” – and sort it against the last item from the previous pair, “Alligator Zombies.” Now, your shelf should consist of: “Albatross Zombies” followed by “Aardvark Zombies” followed by “Alligator Zombies.” Then you repeat this until you’ve gone through all your books and start over however many times it takes until your entire collection is sorted, meaning you no longer need to switch the places of any books. Obviously, if you have a house full of books, this isn’t the easiest way to do things. A better way to go is to use the insertion sort: Take all your books off the shelf and simply put them back, one by one, always ensuring each one goes in the right place compared to the books you’ve already put back. Even better for massive collections is the merge sort method: divide everything into multiple piles, sort those from A to Z and then merge the piles together afterward. Now that your shelves are in order, let’s turn to those stacks of paper on your desk and all the notes and info that you keep close at hand. These are probably important things, like pending bills or letters needing an urgent reply – documents requiring easy access. Computers have a pretty useful way of dealing with things that need to be quickly retrieved. They store their data either in a hard disk drive or a solid state drive. Each comes with its own advantages. While hard drives can store more data, solid-state drives (SSDs) are quicker at getting that data to you. Nowadays, many devices combine these drives, storing important things in a fast SSD and using a hard drive to store big archives. But the most important and most frequently used information is stored in the cache, the treasured upper layer of memory that can be accessed quickest of all. Computers use a simple algorithm to decide what gets stored in the cache. It’s called Last Recently Used (LRU), and it basically stores whatever you used last on top, in the upper layer of the cache. This algorithm is a simple way for your computer to guess which file might be needed in the future. Luckily, it also works well in the analog world for bills, important letters and things you need to keep in reach and on your mind. This means that all the clutter on your desk can stay where it is, because, probably, your organized mess already has all your recently used items and most important letters sitting right on top! Our brains work in a similar fashion as well: if some information goes unused for a long time, we have a hard time remembering it. So, if you’re preparing for a big exam or meeting in the morning, read your notes right before you go to bed. The information will be more easily accessible when you wake up. Aside from getting files in order, another key to productivity is organizing your time and figuring out how to get everything done. Every day has its challenges. It can be difficult to find the time to meet all your deadlines – and not forget to take the dog to the vet. Fortunately, there are plenty of algorithms that deal with these kinds of scheduling problems. For instance, if you’re juggling multiple tasks and not sure where to begin, use the Earliest Due Date algorithm and always start with the task that has the closest deadline. If time is running out and you know that you’re not going to get everything done, follow Moore’s Algorithm and skip the task that requires the most time; this way, you’ll get more tasks done overall. But whatever you do, beware of priority inversion. This happens when minor tasks take up all your time and energy and nothing important gets done. Unfortunately, there are no time-management silver bullets. Studies have shown that the majority of the scheduling problems we face can’t be solved with a quick-and-easy solution. And of course, scheduling itself can eat up a lot of your day, so be sure to limit the amount of time you devote to organizing your time. This probably sounds pretty complicated, but when in doubt, there’s one simple method you can use to get the most done in the shortest amount of time: Focus on one thing at a time and ignore any emails or other requests you receive while doing so. Constantly switching your attention from the task to your inbox and back is incredibly time-consuming and overwhelming, because every switch burdens your working memory and requires you to start afresh. So just focus on one task at a time, and ignore any and all distractions. Don’t even worry about the length of your to-do list; it will all get done in due time. With this in mind, you should be able to accomplish more and increase your productivity without even worrying about where to start. Most of us would love to be able to see into the future, but what about the next best thing: predicting what will probably happen? With the help of algorithms, predicting probable outcomes isn’t so far-fetched. This kind of forecasting goes back to eighteenth-century England, when Reverend Thomas Bayes figured out a basic method for predicting the likelihood of future events, such as drawing a winning lottery ticket, given certain prior events. Let’s try applying Bayes’s logic to today’s lottery scratch tickets. Imagine you bought three scratchers and want to use them to understand what proportion of the tickets in circulation offer some kind of win. Bayes’s insight was that you have to start by hypothesizing about the prevalence of winners among all the tickets in circulation, and using this as an assumption, calculate the probability of the results you actually see in your three tickets. For example, if all three of your tickets are winners, you could reasonably assume that all tickets in circulation offer a win. After all, if all tickets are winners, then you should witness three out of three tickets winning 100 percent of the time. But if only half the tickets were winners, then your threefold luck would have only had a 12.5-percent chance of befalling you. So it’s far likelier that all the tickets are winners. Of course, the more information you collect, the more precise your next hypothesis will be. But, over the years, math has developed and given us more precise tools to make better predictions. What significantly helps those predictions is to understand the distribution pattern of a phenomenon. For instance, there’s the famous “bell curve,” modeled on a normal distribution, which applies to many phenomena. When predicting the average age of a random group of people, you can assume that few people are extremely young or extremely old; most fall somewhere in the middle of the bell. This way, if you’re going on a blind date, you can be reasonably sure you won’t be dining with a nonagenarian. Other situations follow the power-law-distribution, which is quite different. In these cases, we reach the median average by having most observations falling below it and only a few enormous ones falling above it. An excellent example of this is wealth distribution. Generally speaking, there are many poor people and only a select few that own the lion’s share of the world’s wealth. Here’s a classic thought experiment: Two generals are preparing to launch a joint attack on a city located in a fortified valley. The only problem is that each general is on a hill with the valley separating them, and before they can attack they need to agree on the exact time. However, the only way to get a message across is to send someone through the valley, where their messengers are likely to be captured. So how can they determine a time and know that the other has agreed to it? This kind of problem is something computer scientists pondered in order to come up with algorithms to help ensure messages get to their destination safely. The first method they devised is called retransmitted till breakdown. The idea would be to send in messenger after messenger, hoping that one will eventually make it through without being captured. This is essentially what we do when we keep texting or calling a friend until they finally reply. But of course, these days we mostly face other problems than intercepted messengers. Let’s say that every time you’re going to check your email you’re getting an error saying the server is overloaded. In this case, the Exponential Backoff method can help. Instead of frantically hitting refresh, wait a couple minutes for the traffic to ease up. And if you’re still getting the error after that, double the waiting time to four minutes before trying again, and keep doubling until it gets through. Ideally, everyone trying to use the server would follow this method, as it would help ensure a quick resolution. But the best solution would be to prevent the overload problem in the first place, a method called Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD). This algorithm helps you determine the maximum amount of data a network can handle. It starts by sending just one package of data; then it sends double the amount each subsequent time until it reaches the point of overload. Then it tries to pinpoint the limit by sending the highest amount before the failure occurred and increasing the subsequent packages by a tiny amount until the limit is reached. Have you ever heard of the prisoner’s dilemma? Imagine you and a partner have successfully robbed a bank. Later, you’re both brought in for questioning by the police and placed in separate rooms. You know they don’t have sufficient evidence to convict either of you for the robbery, so if you keep your mouth shut, all they can do is give you a one-year sentence for a lesser charge. After that, you will get out and can enjoy your loot. But here’s the twist: the cops offer both you and your partner a deal: If you testify against your partner and he stays silent, you’ll go free and he’ll go to jail for ten years. However, if you both turn on each other, you’ll each get a five-year sentence. What do you do? This is a classic strategic question that represents game theory, which explores how rational people would respond to such a situation. In the case of the prisoners, they would almost certainly turn on one another, in which case they’d each get a sentence of five years. In this scenario there is a clear maximum reward – incriminate the other person, face no jail time and have a chance of keeping all the money. Even if your partner also talks, a five-year sentence is still better than the ten years you would get if you stay silent. But, in the end, since each person would end up testifying against the other one, it’s the cops who win. Another branch of game theory is the more straightforward mechanism design. Rather than setting options in the hopes of getting a certain reaction, it forces people to behave in a desirable way. For example, many employers face the problem of employees not using their vacation time. And employers know that well-rested employees perform much better than overworked ones. The company Evernote went so far as to offer its staff a thousand-dollar bonus for taking time off, but even this didn’t work. When you apply mechanism design to this problem, you don’t need to figure out ways of convincing your employees. All you need to do is ask yourself how to make them take their vacation. And the answer is simple: Make vacations mandatory! As you can see, algorithms have applications in many fields. Finally, in the last blink, let’s discuss their limitations. When you’re trying to model something complicated, complex models are generally better than simple ones. For example, if you’re developing a model to explain the cause of obesity, you’ll want a complex one that takes many factors into account, from a poor diet to genetics to lack of exercise. A simple model might focus solely on diet, which would be insufficient. However, problems also arise when models grow too complex. This is a risk when considering real-world problems, where there’s always going to be uncertainty and errors in the data. Most likely, you’d start with a sample data set and would try to build an algorithm that makes predictions based on it. The temptation is to add variables to the algorithm until it explains everything in data perfectly, including the errors. This is known as overfitting, and it creates problems when you try to apply the same algorithm to different data. Basically, the model has been so rigorously adapted to the sample data that it has lost all flexibility and will not work well with any other data. For example, when considering obesity, in your sample data you might notice that certain areas of the country have more obesity than others. But this could well be a coincidence, and if you tweak your model to emphasize the importance of a person’s location, it will worsen the predictive power of the model when you apply it to new data where location is inconsequential. When you realize that perfect algorithms don’t exist, you can relax your standards a bit and go for good enough instead of perfect. Consider the travelling-salesman-problem, which asks: How can you find the single best route between multiple points without having to go anywhere twice. If you expand this problem to a whole state or country, it gets unspeakably complex. In a situation like this, the most efficient solution is to relax your standards. Let your salesman visit different locations at least twice. You’ll end up close to a good solution in a reasonable time, even if it might not be a perfect one. As you’ve learned from these blinks, if you understand their limits and possibilities, algorithms can be applied in many areas of life. The key message in this book: Algorithms are not incomprehensible things that only exist to help mathematicians and computers. In fact, we use them every day, even if we’re unaware of it. Algorithms contain a lot of problem-solving wisdom that can help you make good decisions, predict probable outcomes and become a more productive individual. Actionable advice: Do the simple stuff first. The next time your to-do list gets too long and you want to check off as many things as possible, go for the Shortest Processing Time algorithm: List your tasks in order of what can be done the fastest. This enables you to get lots of things done in a very short period of time. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Altered Traits",
    "author": "Daniel Goleman and Richard J. Davidson",
    "summary": "It’s easy to be sceptical about meditation. Given its increasing popularity in the Western world over the past decades, it can be seen as a fad without real substance. But the good news is that the value of meditation can be determined scientifically. Citing numerous studies – some of which were conducted by the authors themselves – understanding meditation from a scientific point-of-view will satiate curious minds. These blinks explain how meditation helps to develop positive attributes that will help you become a better individual. We’ll explore specific parts of the brain affected by meditative practices and learn how we can use the knowledge to our advantage. The benefits of meditation are for everyone, whether you’re a seasoned meditator or someone who’s looking to try it out for the first time. In these blinks, you’ll discover why multitasking isn’t helpful; the implications of a wandering mind; and how meditation can help you better process emotion. When he was a Harvard graduate student, Goleman, one of the authors, traveled to India to learn about meditation. There are many different types of meditation, but Goleman was advised by one of his meditation teachers, Anagarika Munindra, to study one found in an ancient text called the Visuddhimagga, or Path to Purification. This type of meditation focuses on a single thing. Written in the fifth century, the Visuddhimagga is the principal text of Theravada Buddhism, a branch that is widespread among many Southeast Asian nations. It’s also the source of mindfulness, which teaches you to develop your concentration by focusing explicitly on one thing. Typically, you begin by focusing on your breath. In the beginning, it will be hard to concentrate on one thing as your mind zips back and forth between thoughts. However, with practice, your thoughts will calm and your mind will become quiet so that the only thing you are paying attention to is your breathing. Another type of meditation is based on not reacting to your thoughts. It comes directly from the founder of Buddhism, Gautama Buddha, who lived during the sixth century BC. In contrast to the type of meditation mentioned earlier, this one encourages you to remain cognizant of all your thoughts. What’s important here is to refrain from reacting to them. You need to instantly let go of thoughts as they pop into your mind, instead of hanging on and becoming consumed by them. Over time you will develop equanimity, meaning that it won’t matter whether the thoughts you have are self-hating or romantic fantasies – they’ll simply become passing musings that bear no impact on your core consciousness. Regardless of whether you prefer the first or second type of meditation, both are equally respected. The main thing to consider is which type will benefit you the most. In the following blinks, we’ll take a look at what those benefits are. Picture yourself in an interview with two potential employers who show no signs of empathy or encouragement. After trying to prove yourself as a valuable addition to their company, they ask you to do a bit of arithmetic: Start with 1324, then subtract 17, then minus 17 again and keep going without making any errors. This is a form of the Trier Social Stress Test – a psychological test that calculates participants’ reactions to social stress situations. Participants’ heart rates and blood pressure are measured to determine how they handle certain stress triggers. Meditation is one way to help participants become less responsive to triggers within the Trier Social Stress Test. In 2012, researchers Paul Ekman and Alan Wallace studied the impact of meditation on lowering social stress levels among teachers. The study found that after being exposed to the Trier test, teachers’ blood pressures returned to normal quicker if they’d practiced meditation. In fact, the longer they meditated, the faster their recovery from stress, and it was effective even five months after the meditation training. In 2016, the author Davidson replicated the Ekman and Wallace study in his lab, with the addition of experienced meditators. On the first day, the participants spent eight hours in meditation, and on the following day, they took the Trier test. In comparison to the group of non-meditators, the meditation group produced less cortisol, a stress hormone, when exposed to triggers. Moreover, the meditation group didn’t find the Trier test particularly stressful. Meditation can also reduce your reactions to emotional cues. In 2017, Davidson continued working with the same experienced meditators in another experiment. This time, Davidson used a scanner to observe the brain activity of participants as they looked at images of injured and suffering people. The part of the brain analyzed was the amygdala, which is involved in emotional processing. Davidson found that the amygdala of meditators were less reactive to the images than those of non-meditators. This is because meditators had a stronger link between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex – the part of the brain related to planning and other complex cognitive functions. It has been shown that the amygdala-prefrontal cortex connection lowers the effect of strong emotions, whether they’re positive or negative. Multitasking is a common phenomenon of the modern world. Nowadays, we’re juggling various duties while being bombarded with texts, calls, emails, Facebook notifications and Instagram photos. Some try to work on their ability to handle several tasks at once, but multitasking is inefficient and mentally exhausting. In 2009, Eyal Ophir, a communications scientist from Stanford University, conducted a study which found that the brain is unable to multitask. When trying to do many things at once, our attention switches quickly between those tasks and we lose concentration, meaning that we need more time to regain that focus when returning to our original task. The study also found that people who multitask regularly are easily distracted and thus have to use more areas of their brain to concentrate. Thankfully, inefficient multitasking can be replaced with meditation, which helps to strengthen our capacity for concentration. Psychologists Thomas E. Gorman and C. Shawn Green ran a study in 2016 that compared the concentration ability of two groups of students. Prior to the test, one group browsed the internet for ten minutes, while the other group meditated by counting their breaths. During the concentration tests, the meditators showed greater improvement in their ability to concentrate, most notably among the students who multitasked regularly. Another study ran in 2012 by Michael D. Mrazek, who teaches at the Santa Barbara University of California, found that longer meditation reduced distraction and helped students to improve their scores on the grad school entrance exams by up to 30 percent. When faced with a difficult mathematical equation, you probably think your brain needs to fire up in order to solve it. But when engaged in arduous tasks, many areas of the brain deactivate. Moreover, when we do nothing at all, these same parts of the brain reactivate. So when we’re doing nothing, our brains aren’t really resting. In fact, the brain enters what is called the default mode. Neuroscientist Marcus Raichle, who worked at Washington University in St. Louis, discovered in 2001 that when we think we’re doing nothing, many parts of the brain show high activity. The brain only makes up two percent of our entire body mass, yet uses up 20 percent of our metabolic energy. Surprisingly, the brain uses a similar amount of energy regardless of whether it’s actively focused on reading Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason or sunbathing at the beach. The posterior cingulate cortex and the midline of the prefrontal cortex are the two areas that are activated when we’re supposedly not doing anything. Two of these components comprise the brain’s default mode network – where the brain is active during rest. The problem is that the default mode isn’t healthy and needs to be switched off. This is where meditation can help. During default mode, the brain is unhappily distracted and wandering. Not too long ago, researchers from Harvard asked thousands of participants to pay attention to the association between their level of concentration and their mood. The majority reported that they were less happy when the mind wasn’t as focused. This is because our brain likes to revisit our dissatisfactions and anxieties. Through meditation, we can change its impact on our well-being. In 2011, psychiatrist Judson Brewer found that people who meditate regularly showed a stronger link between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the default mode network. This connection is developed through meditation, and it helps to soothe the mind when we aren’t engaged in a mentally strenuous task. Meditation can calm people and help their focus. But what if meditation has a bigger impact, particularly on our brain cells? There are studies that indicate meditation makes the brain stronger. The first evidence for this came from a 2005 study conducted by Sara Lazar, who worked at Harvard Medical School. Lazar found that meditation made certain areas of the brain grow thicker. The implications of what this would mean for humans has yet to be determined, but the study did suggest that parts of the brain were improving. Since Lazar’s initial study, many more have been conducted. In 2014, neurologist Kieran C. R. Fox from Stanford University meta-analyzed 21 of these studies. Fox found that meditation strengthened three areas of the brain: the insula, which is the part responsible for the recognition of emotional and physical bodily processes, the prefrontal cortex, which is important for focused attention and the cingulate cortex, which helps with self-regulation and impulse control. Then, in 2016, neurologist Eileen Luders from UCLA found that the brain rejuvenates with meditation, which slows down brain cell death. Of those participants in their 50s, the ones that meditated had brains on average 7.5 years younger than those of non-meditators. Despite the extensive studies on the effects of meditation on brain activity and general well-being, the findings should be taken with a grain of salt. While it’s true that Luders’ study generally showed that the brains of meditators were healthier, the participants practiced different types of meditation, including Vipassana, Zen Buddhism and Kundalini Yoga. There are stark differences between these forms of meditation. Some leave the mind completely open, so that you become aware of everything, while others teach you to focus on only one thing. Likewise, some types advise you to control your breathing, while others recommend to let it come naturally. It’s therefore hard to determine which aspects of each meditation are responsible for the positive effects on the brain, and further study in this area is necessary. Western branches of medicine have not yet found an adequate response to psychiatric disorders that aren’t responsive to drugs. Perhaps meditation could help? Some studies suggest that meditation can help to alleviate depression. One study, conducted in 2000 by cognitive psychologist John Teasdale from Oxford University, indicated that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) was helpful in preventing depression. MBCT is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that requires the patient to concentrate on one thing. Another study at Oxford University, this time ran by Mark Williams in 2014, had two control groups: one received cognitive therapy, while the other received traditional pharmaceutical treatment. Results showed that MBCT was most effective when the depression stemmed from childhood traumas. With other types of depression, however, MBCT worked just as well as the drugs. Alberto Chiesa from the University of Bologna ran a study in 2015 which found that patients who did not show improvements from medication did feel better with MBCT. Cognitive psychologist Zindel Segal, also from Oxford, provided further evidence to support the positive role of meditation on people with depression. Segal used fMRI scans to demonstrate that MBCT reinforced the insula of patients with depression, meaning they could more easily gain perspective on their lives, instead of feeling overwhelmed by their thoughts and emotions. Additionally, the study showed that relapses were reduced by 35% after MBCT. Meditation can also help lower the risk of depression. Pregnant women with a history of depression are vulnerable to experiencing depression during and after giving birth and are often hesitant to take antidepressants while pregnant. Luckily, the study by Sona Dimidjian in 2016 showed that pregnant women could use MBCT to lower the risk of depression. Furthermore, a 2016 study by S. Nidich in Iowa found that transcendental meditation, which requires you to silently repeat chants or mantras, helped male prisoners decrease their depression and anxiety levels. In the autumn of 2002, a Tibetan monk named Mingyur Rinpoche arrived at Madison Airport in Wisconsin. One of the authors had invited the monk to his lab so that he could measure the brain activity of a yogi – the master of meditation. The author found that neurological changes were more visible in the brain of a yogi. At the author’s lab, Rinpoche was hooked up to an electroencephalogram (EEG), which tunes into brain waves to measure the level of brain activation. Meanwhile, a scholar – aided by a translator – asked Rinpoche to practice compassion meditation, which involves focusing initially on feeling compassionate towards people you love, before extending that love to every single living thing in the universe. In between these regular intervals of compassion meditation, the yogi was asked to rest. The study found that during moments of compassion meditation, the yogi’s brain waves spiked to an unusually high level, which continued for the entire one-minute interval. Typically, these unusually high spikes would only be seen when someone accidentally sets off the EEG sensors. But the yogi didn’t move a muscle. During the resting phases, the spikes lowered slightly but returned to their high levels as soon as he was instructed to meditate again. The yogi’s brain demonstrated the power of compassion. In the second part of the author’s study, the yogi’s neural activity was recorded with an fMRI machine, which allowed for a more precise look at which areas were being activated. This time, it was obvious that the areas associated with empathy were activated. Rather than hitting normal levels, however, activation rose by 800 percent in comparison to when the yogi was resting. Such an incredible level of neural activity had never before been seen in science. The closest recordings came from schizophrenics, but these were never voluntary, unlike Rinpoche, who achieved supernormal brain power with intent. There are many different types of meditators around the world. Some meditate sporadically, while others go off to meditation retreats and practice for thousands of hours. If you’re a yogi, then meditating over a three-year period is nothing out of the ordinary. Similar to the various types of meditation, the effects are different for everyone. But even meditating just a little bit will help you see beneficial effects. In Western society, though most people who meditate are beginners, that doesn’t mean they’re not already reaping the benefits. In fact, there’s evidence to suggest that the amygdala becomes less responsive after 30 hours of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction meditation. Furthermore, seven hours of practicing compassion has been shown to strengthen areas of the brain related to empathy and positive emotions, such as pleasure and enjoyment. With the aforementioned Gorman and Green study, we’ve learned that concentration levels can increase slightly with eight minutes of mindfulness. After two weeks of daily eight-minute meditation sessions, enhanced concentration resulted in improved test scores. The thing is, none of these methods resulted in long-lasting benefits unless they were sustained over a lengthier period. Therefore, the more you practice meditation, the more benefits you’ll receive. After meditating for thousands of hours, you become less reactive to stress triggers, your brain’s ability to regulate emotion enhances and your body releases less of the stress hormone cortisol. Long-term compassion meditation results in higher levels of empathy, which enables meditators to better understand the suffering of others. Additionally, it increases the chances that you would take action to help people in need. As concentration levels increase, mind-wandering dwindles. This is especially beneficial for people who tend to get caught up in their own lives – reducing their level of self-centeredness and allowing more time for others. The advantages of meditation are significant, and now that you know there’s scientific evidence to prove it, there’s little reason not to try meditation to aid your path towards self-improvement. The key message in these blinks: For a long time, people have celebrated meditation as a source of inner peace, wisdom and tranquility. However, in the last few decades, there’s been increasing scientific evidence to back up these claims. Studies have shown that meditation can improve concentration and empathy levels, as well as lower the risk of depression. Further research is required, but it’s safe to say that meditation enriches the brain. Actionable advice: Make time for meditation. Most people who say they want to meditate claim they have no time to do so, but this is simply untrue. How much time do you spend on social media each day? You’ll probably find out that you’ve got more spare time than you think. Even if you have a really full schedule, you can always squeeze in some mindfulness meditation. You can practice on the commute to work, while on a snack break or even while doing the groceries. It’s all about focusing your attention on the task at hand. Got feedback?

    "title": "America Before",
    "author": "Graham Hancock",
    "summary": "For a long time, academic consensus has been that people arrived in America around 13,000 years ago or perhaps a couple of thousand years earlier via an ice-bridge from Asia. But there are a few people on the fringe who think that this view is too narrow-minded. Graham Hancock is one who believes the evidence points to another and – more exciting – conclusion. In these blinks, we’ll discover Graham Hancock’s belief that human civilization in America is much older and much more fascinating than you had ever imagined. His is a much more dramatic theory of America: a tale of a sophisticated civilization that sailed the oceans many thousands of years ago before being destroyed in an earth-shattering natural disaster. This reworking of human history will take you on a journey into the deep past, traveling through Ancient Egypt, sailing the banks of the Amazon and exploring Native American monuments. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how Australasian DNA ended up in Native Americans; what happens when 10 percent of the world is on fire; and how an Egyptian temple tells the tale of a lost American civilization. The exact point when humanity first set foot in North America has long been a battleground in archeology. And the official academic position has not always been in line with the evidence. Let’s explain. A hundred and twenty years ago, most scholars believed that there had been no human presence on the North American landmass until 4,000 years ago – the view of an influential scholar, Aleš Hrdlička. The head of anthropology at the Smithsonian Institute’s National Museum of Natural History, Hrdlička made life miserable for any scholar who disagreed with him. A colleague, Frank H. H. Roberts, later admitted that discussing early humanity in North America became so taboo that no academic serious about his career would go near it. However, in the 1920s and 1930s, evidence emerged which showed that there has been human life in America since at least 12,000 years ago. And it was so compelling that even the most conservative academics had to pay attention. At a site near a town called Clovis in New Mexico, researchers found beautiful and distinctive projectiles, clearly human-made. They were found next to and in creatures like sabre-toothed cats that had been extinct for over 12,000 years. Here, excitingly, was proof that humans had been present in North America for at least that length of time. Further research led to the discovery of as many as 1,500 Clovis sites, as they came to be known, all across North America. But instead of seeing Clovis as a starting point, the academic community treated it as an immutable truth. Soon a consensus known as Clovis First emerged – the idea that no older human cultures in America would ever be found. Dissenters faced ridicule. By 2012, the behavior of the Clovis First brigade was so nasty that the editor of the journal Nature stated that the debate about the earliest Americans had become among the most acrimonious and least productive in all science. When a Canadian archeologist presented fascinating evidence of human activity in caves in the Yukon, 24,000 years ago, he was laughed at. So, when the archeological community pours scorn on an idea when they reject new theories about earlier humans in the Americas, you shouldn’t just bow to their expertise. They’ve been proved wrong time and time again. And with that healthy commitment to open inquiry in mind, let’s take a look at the evidence for much, much earlier life in America. Ice is just as important as earth when it comes to digging into the past. Clovis First argued that humanity came to America via the Bering Strait, the space between eastern Russia and western Alaska. Today that’s a sea, but once there was an icy land bridge. Although harsh, it would have been passable for the nomads of Asian Siberia. For a long time though, access to the rest of America was limited; the northern parts – think modern-day Alaska and Canada – were covered by a huge, impassable mass of ice. But around 14,100 years ago, a period of warming saw a passable corridor through the ice open up. Suddenly, according to Clovis First, Siberian nomads had access to the rest of the American continent. If we were to accept that people first arrived in America from Asia, this all makes sense. The ice barrier of North America would have made migration simply impossible. There is no way people could have passed through. Well, the discovery of a mastodon, a wooly mammoth-like creature, outside San Diego in 1992 changed all that. When Tom Deméré, chief paleontologist at San Diego’s Natural History Museum, examined the mastodon, he realized that humans had hammered its femoral bones. They had been broken on an anvil stone that was found next to them. Humans had clearly been breaking the bones, perhaps to extract their marrow. Mastodons, along with the rest of American megafauna and Clovis cultures, disappeared around 12,000 years ago. So this discovery wasn’t earth-shattering at first. But, 22 years after this mastodon was found, a radiometric dating analysis changed everything. The analysis, commissioned by Deméré, established once and for all that the bones were not 13,000 years old but ten times older – from 130,000 years ago. This was an incredible discovery, and reactions ranged from healthy skepticism to outright dismissal. The consequences of this single fossil for our understanding of America and its people are staggering. America was not peopled during the last period of deglaciation, from 14,700 to 12,800 years ago, but many thousands of years earlier. And that raises new questions – from where, and how, did these people get to America? The answers are surprising. It’s always better to pursue the truth than simply to accept the consensus. And the truth is that DNA analysis of early Americans raises interesting questions about their origins. In 2015, geneticists, including Pontus Skoglund and David Reich from Harvard Medical School, discovered a curious anomaly in the DNA of people in the Amazon descended from Native Americans. In the journal Nature, they described how genome analysis had found lineage between Native Americans in the Amazon and Aboriginal people from Australasia. These South Americans bore more similarity to people from across the oceans in Australasia than they did to other Native Americans from the north of the continent. This signal was unexpected and confusing. Skoglund and Reich tested the signal over and over again to check that it wasn't an error. But however much they tested, the Australasian DNA was still there. The conclusion, according to Reich, was that there wasn’t a single, founding population of America that came over the Bering land bridge. There was another, very old founding population, and most traces of it are now lost. Perhaps we find it most clearly in the remote Amazon because people there have experienced less mingling of genes than other Americans. The consequences of this discovery are exciting and clear: prehistoric settlers from Australasia could have sailed the Pacific Ocean to South America. Well, the scholarly academic community rejects the idea that our Stone-Age ancestors were anything other than primitive. But there is evidence that Homo erectus lived on Indonesian islands 800,000 years ago, implying they got there by boat. So if ocean crossings were possible by these pre-humans, why shouldn’t Homo sapiens have made it across the Pacific? Some academics are at least open to the theoretical possibility. Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen’s GeoGenetics Center believes that America was peopled only via the Bering land bridge. But in emails with the author, Willerslev accepted the existence of the Australian signal in DNA and accepted that there is no good explanation for its presence. The simplest answer, Willerslev admitted, would be an ocean crossing. It’s just that, he argued, there is currently no evidence that people at this time could make such a journey. As we’ll see now, the Amazon has more secrets to share with us. In 1541, Brother Gaspar de Carvajal joined an expedition setting out from Quito, in today’s Ecuador, toward the Amazon and into the unknown. Carvajal’s account describes encounters deep into the jungle with a rich and sophisticated civilization. He found cities glistening in white, one stretching for 20 kilometers along the banks of the Amazon, the length of Manhattan. Vast lands were given over to agriculture, Carvajal reported, and roads ventured into the jungle. In one village they captured, the Spaniards found porcelain goods of a beauty and intricacy not reached even in imperial Spain. Carvajal’s account is treated as fantasy because it cuts against mainstream thinking that the Amazon was too remote, too wild to host civilizations. But the friar, a man of faith, gave his word that he reported the truth. And today, evidence suggests maybe he did. Indeed the very wildness of the Amazon may be what is covering up the evidence. Consider that a review of dense forest in Guatemala, terrain very similar to the Amazon, led to a major archeological surprise in 2018. Laser technology discovered over 60,000 houses, palaces, fortresses and elevated highways that we previously had no idea existed. And for further proof of the potential sophistication of the early people in the Amazon, look to the earth. Scholars have discovered the presence of a man-made soil with unusually fertile properties. Terra preta, or black earth, is found throughout the Amazon and has been described as the most fertile soil in the world. What’s particularly intriguing is the question of how it was discovered. It is formed of a compost of a complex collection of animal and human bodily waste, along with fish bones and other household wastes. This must then be burned in a specific and unusual way using wet vegetation to ensure that the substance smolders rather than fully burns. Of course, it could be that terra preta was an accidental discovery. That some hunter-gatherer just stumbled upon the exact right mix of products and the precisely correct way to burn them to create it. But isn’t it more likely that terra preta was invented by a sophisticated population that realized that, if it was to thrive in the Amazon, it would need to develop a highly efficient agricultural system? Examining the soil is one way to learn the secrets of the past. Another is to take to the skies. In 1977, a researcher called Alceu Ranzi spotted something astonishing while flying in a Smithsonian research plane high above the Amazon. Ranzi identified what he would call geoglyphs – huge, geometrically designed earthworks. Seen from the sky, the geoglyph earthworks form perfect circles, rectangles and other shapes, and connect with each other via straight roads, usually on a clear northwest-to-southwest orientation, meaning that they are aligned with solar movements. Originally thought to be 750 years old, the geoglyphs were dated at 2,000 years old in a 2012 study. These beautiful works were a surprisingly sophisticated creation for this point in Amazonian history. Fly 11 hours north to the Mississippi Valley, and you find eerily similar earthworks created by a completely separate culture. At Newark Earthworks in Ohio, you’ll find a beautifully laid out octagon connected by a causeway to an immense circle 321.3 meters in diameter. The circle’s diameter is accurate to within a meter of a perfect circle. The works are perfectly aligned with another set of earthworks located 60 miles away, at High Bank, hinting at a high level of sophistication for its creators. The Amazonian and Native American creations clearly share a style, and they may just share a purpose: to reflect and memorialize the sky above us. The geometry of the High Bank and Newark earthworks are closely aligned with obscure and rare cosmological events called lunar standstills. With almost exact precision, lines drawn between different points of their octagons offer perfect views of the most northerly and southerly spots on the horizon at which the moon sets and rises. This demonstration of a deep understanding of the cosmos is not an exception. At Poverty Point in Northeastern Louisiana, geometric ridges offer perfect views of the summer and winter solstices and the equinox sun. And while no academics have bothered to conduct a proper astro-archeological study of the Amazonian geoglyphs, they may well be aligned with the solstice, when the sun reaches its most northerly and southerly point from the equator. Explore the world, and you’ll find more and more examples of ancient architecture, from England’s Stonehenge to Cambodia’s Angkor Wat, built by disparate cultures but reflecting the skies and deeply rooted in geometry. How were the makers of these works able to build such sophisticated geometric and apparently astronomic structures? Perhaps the answer lies in a shared source robust enough to transmit a complex architectural system over thousands of years in multiple different cultures. In short, a common origin. A mysterious shaft built into Egypt’s Great Pyramid points directly at the belt of Orion. Its purpose? A portal through which the soul of the dead could journey to Orion, the entry point to the Duat – the realm of the dead. Moundville in Alabama is a long way from Egypt. But there you’ll learn that the tribes who built its earthworks believed that the dead journeyed to the afterlife through an opening marked by a warrior’s hand in the sky. The wrist of that hand? Orion’s belt. There are countless similarities between Egyptian and Native American conceptions of the afterlife. The Egyptian Books of the Dead talk of the need for the soul to ascend a ladder reaching to Orion. Meanwhile, Native American afterlife stories, according to renowned expert Professor George Lankford, talk of the soul having to make a terrifying leap and being able to reach the realm of the dead by walking the Milky Way – sometimes called the path of souls – until eventually reaching the opening of Orion’s belt. And both cultures agreed that the final leap into the portal represented by stars of Orion’s belt could only happen at exactly the right time. In Lankford’s account, this was when those stars set low in the west of the sky, just before disappearing under the horizon. And in Egypt? There too, the final leap into the realm of the dead could be made when the stars vanish on the horizon. Some of the similarities are rather gruesome. An Egyptian scene shows a goddess opening a dead man’s head with a hatchet. It’s a grim scene, but one that might have been recognizable to Native Americans familiar with their tales of a frightening female figure called the brain-smasher encountered on the journey to the afterlife. These similarities are too uncanny to be ignored. But they cannot easily be explained. That’s because there is no possibility of direct influence between the two cultures. Egypt’s civilizations died out in the fifth century AD, whereas the Native American art at Moundville dates to around 1500 AD. They never made contact. So how can we explain these similarities? One possibility is that they shared a common predecessor. But as we near the end of our journey of discovery, we first need to understand what happened over twelve thousand years ago when life on earth suffered a cataclysm of destruction. Twelve thousand eight hundred years ago, the world suddenly turned cold. For around 1,200 years in what is now known as the Younger Dryas period, the globe froze. What happened? Well, one theory is that the Earth found itself in the path of a meteor stream, and for 21 years was bombarded by fragments of a disintegrating comet, with devastating consequences. Research by Wendy Wolbach, a chemistry professor at DePaul University, and a group of other scholars, published in a study in the Journal of Geology in 2018, argues that 9 percent of all plant matter in the world burned. An area of over 10 million square kilometers was aflame, equivalent to the whole of North America. Smoke enshrouded the globe, reducing sunlight and ushering in six months of ice-cold winter and ultimately the Younger Dryas period – 1,000 years of glacial weather. Ice-sheets, destabilized by the impact, released vast volumes of water, raising sea levels by up to four meters in a flood that would have destroyed everything in its path, according to Wolbach’s research. Consequences for life on earth were dire. Megafauna like mammoths and sabre-tooth tigers died out. At over 73 sites in the United States, bones and remains of mammoths can be found just underneath a black layer of earth that contains tell-tale signs of the catastrophe, like charcoal and glass-like carbon, indicators of biomass burning. And what’s intriguing is that we know that the Clovis culture, advanced for its time, died out. The sophisticated Clovis hunting points never appeared again. But some human life, hunter-gatherers, did survive. We should not be surprised. Hunter-gatherers are tough people. Indeed, if earth faced such a disaster today, those of us reliant on technology and an advanced civilization would be doomed. But the few remaining hunter-gatherers, like those in the Kalahari, or in the Amazon rainforest, might just tough it out. So let’s consider the possibility that 12,800 years ago, a similar situation occurred. Consider that, in the hundred thousand years before this cataclysm, human life had split between a large majority of simple hunter-gatherers and a small minority who had taken a more advanced path. It’s not unreasonable to suppose that this small but advanced civilization might have collapsed. But perhaps, before doing so, it deliberately passed on its knowledge in the hope that it would survive into the future. Why did the Clovis people suddenly appear, with an advanced point technology, with no evidence of how it was developed? How do we explain the Australasian DNA in the Amazon? Why do Old World and New World cultures have shared geology, astronomy, archeology and belief systems, despite never having come into contact with each other? The only credible explanation is a single, lost source civilization, wiped out in the disaster of the Younger Dryas, but whose flame lived on through knowledge transmitted and used by later civilizations. Let’s consider how. Entertain the idea that, before the Younger Dryas period, a small minority of humans developed a sophisticated civilization. We know, from the traces it has left in later societies, that this civilization had a close interest in the sky. It’s easy to imagine, therefore, that the astronomer-priests of this civilization would have seen early warning signs of the terrors to come written in the sky in the shape of shooting stars. Just as we would today, astronomers would no doubt have calculated orbits and trajectories and concluded that life on earth was under threat. Planning for the worst and realizing the superior survival skills of their hunter-gatherer contemporaries, they developed a contingency plan. They would connect with hunter-gatherers and teach them to carry onward the flame of their civilization – their beliefs, technology and architecture. Cynics may cast doubt on this explanation. But consider that this idea, of the rebirth of a lost world, is told in one of the key texts of Ancient Egypt. Texts written on temple walls in Edfu, Upper Egypt, tell of the early, primeval age of gods. These gods, according to the texts, were not Egyptian in origin. Rather they come from a holy island, the Homeland of the Primeval Ones, in the middle of a great ocean. Deep in the past, the texts say, a catastrophe hit the earth. A flood destroyed the land, its places of worship, and killed all but a few of its godly inhabitants. These lonely survivors, we are told, set sail to roam the Earth with a single purpose: the resurrection and recreation of a destroyed world. Settling among hunter-gatherer populations, these gods, or as the author suggests, advanced men, kept alive the hope that the flame of their civilization could burn again. And it would. From Egypt to Stonehenge, Angkor Wat to the Mississippi basin, the signs of its rekindling are there for us all to see. Tracing the characteristics of this lost civilization is a little like tracking an Invisible Man. There are signs of his presence everywhere, but he himself remains hidden. One thing that is clear is that it had seafaring capabilities only surpassed by Western civilization in the last few centuries. That’s indicated by the strange Australasian DNA signal of course, but also by the riddle of a series of maps of the world printed in the Middle Ages. Take, for example, the Pizzigano Chart from 1424, possibly the earliest surviving European map with Japan on it. Indeed, the map shows Japan as a single landmass. That is clearly inaccurate for 1424, as today. But 13,000 years ago, due to lower sea levels, Japan was a single landmass. There are other examples. The 1513 Piri Reis map shows a large island to the southeast of the United States. No such island existed in 1513, but go diving in this exact spot, and you’ll find an ancient underwater road of huge rocks. Rocks that, 12,800 years ago, would have formed an island. Scholars argue that these maps are just mistaken. But another view could be that they are further evidence that a civilization, capable not just of sailing but also mapping the oceans, once existed, its knowledge trickling down through the centuries. This civilization would also have had other forms of sophisticated technology, again hinted at only by traces in the archeological record. The distinctive and sophisticated projectiles of the Clovis people may well be one such clue. These projectiles, a significant advance on any other hunter-gatherer technology of the period, are first found at sites dating from between 13,400 years ago. But, curiously, they seem to have simply popped into existence, perfectly formed. There is no evidence of their development, of prototypes, or of their technological evolution. Could it be that the Clovis had a helping hand? That they didn’t evolve this technological design but were simply taught it by a more sophisticated civilization? This sudden emergence of the Clovis projectile, just like the sudden emergence of Australasian DNA in America, demands explanation. A lost-source civilization can provide it. Now let’s go on the final part of our journey and let’s consider how, over a period of more than a hundred thousand years, an early civilization might have developed. And how it might have been radically, spiritually different from our own. At Baalbek in modern-day Lebanon three vast stones, each weighing over 800 tons and measuring over 20 meters long, have been carefully laid as part of a larger wall 6 meters above the ground. Even with modern technology, we would struggle to so perfectly lay such a vast stone. So how could an ancient civilization do it? Perhaps the reason we find little evidence for a lost civilization is that it used forces and techniques unknown to contemporary science, manipulating matter in ways that we simply can’t recognize. The author’s theory is that the focus of our lost civilization was on what are today called psi capabilities that use the power of human consciousness to manipulate matter and channel energy. These include telepathy, the ability to communicate from one person to another outside of scientific laws, and telekinesis, the ability to move objects – like a vast stone – with the mind. In the modern world, we are fixated on our technology. But perhaps our lost civilization had an entirely different focus. Perhaps it embraced not material science but shamanism – the acquisition of spiritually driven knowledge and insight through trance and visions, or hallucinations in the language of psychologists. Those wanting to get a taste for the shamanic possibilities that lay before our ancestors could try the potently hallucinogenic plant-based drink ayahuasca, used by the people of the Amazon for thousands of years. According to anthropologist Angelica Gebhart-Sayer, ayahuasca-drinking shamans perceive and learn from the spirit world through information encoded in luminous designs. These designs, you may not be surprised to learn, often take on geometric forms. And as professor of psychology, Benny Shanon from Jerusalem’s Hebrew University notes, almost everyone who has drunk ayahuasca reports telepathic experiences. That’s something the author can personally attest, having drunk it over 70 times. So perhaps, for all our modern riches and technology, there is a large part of the potential human experience which Amazonian shamans understand, but we do not. Maybe, in the Younger Dryas, humanity lost not just evidence of a lost civilization, but the memory of a vital, vibrant part of human experience. The key message in these blinks: The author’s interpretation of the evidence is that a sophisticated civilization developed in America between 130,000 years ago and the time of the Younger Dryas, 12,000 years ago. Seafaring and technologically advanced, this purported civilization had a deep understanding of geometry and astronomy. Today there is no clear evidence for it, except for possible glimmers of its heritage seen in its hypothetical successors, from Ancient Egypt to Native Americans. Got feedback?

    "synopsis": "America Before (2019) is a mind-expanding quest for an ancient and lost way of life. Drawing on lesser-known DNA and archeological evidence, it proposes the existence of a great, early civilization based in North America. Lost to history in the aftermath of a cataclysmic comet strike, this civilization is visible today only in the traces it left in Egyptian, Native American and other great ancient cultures."

    "title": "An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth",
    "author": "Chris Hadfield",
    "summary": "Have you ever wondered what life as an astronaut would be like? Hours of gazing at beautiful planets and floating around in space? In fact, spacewalking makes up just a tiny fraction of the job. In these blinks, you’ll discover that the biggest part of an astronaut’s life is taken up with long periods of pre-flight preparation far from family and home. Obviously, being in zero gravity is loads of fun, but before that can happen, an astronaut has to put in some serious work down here on Earth. Once she’s in orbit, even the simplest tasks are complicated, and as for getting home in one piece? Well, let’s just say it’s hard to stay on target. You’ll also learn that the ratio of time on Earth to time in Space is many months to a single day; why washing your hair isn’t easy in space; and how even sitting on a chair can be uncomfortable after an astronaut gets back from space. What do astronauts do when they aren’t in space? They spend most of their days training, taking classes and studying. So if all you want to do is whip around the earth in a spaceship, you’d hate being an astronaut. Astronauts need a tremendous range of skills. Some are more obvious, like piloting the rocket, walking in space, repairing pieces of the space station and monitoring the experiments on board. Since they’re away from civilization for so long, however, astronauts also need to prepare for some less obvious tasks. They have to be able to perform basic surgery and dentistry, program their computers, rewire any electrical panels and conduct a press conference. They also have to get along with their colleagues while living with them 24/7 in a confined space! Astronauts must be prepared to respond to any crisis that could occur in space. When they’re orbiting the Earth at 400 km, they certainly can’t expect a rescue crew to come get them. There are many dangerous potential situations. Toxic gas could start leaking or a fire break out, for instance. Fires aren’t hypothetical situations, either. In 1997, an oxygen-generating canister started a fire on the Russian space station Mir. The astronauts managed to put it out by throwing wet towels on the canister. Their spacecraft filled with smoke, but thankfully everyone survived. The ratio of time spent in space vs. time spent preparing for space is quite low: for each day in orbit, you have to train for several months. It takes several years of training before you’re assigned to a mission, and then training for a specific missions takes between two and four more. On a space mission, preparation is everything – no matter how intelligent or experienced the astronaut. So, during training, astronauts spend most of their days studying and simulating experiences they may never actually go through. Simulations provide more than just practice: they frequently serve as wake-up calls. Trainers specialize in devising unpredictable bad scenarios for astronauts to work out. They practice what to do if there’s engine trouble, a computer meltdown or an explosion, to name just a few examples. This training pushes astronauts to develop a new set of instincts. Instead of reacting to danger with a fight-or-flight response, they’re trained to respond calmly and immediately. They must prioritize threats and solve them methodically. So astronauts prepare for nearly every conceivable problem that could occur between launching and landing. This also helps them build their improvisational skills for the situations they can’t predict. This training is useful back on Earth, too. It’s very helpful to have plans for dealing with any unpleasant obstacles life might present. Chris Hadfield’s training became ingrained as a form of mental discipline, not just in space but in his regular life, too. When he gets into a crowded elevator he thinks, “What are we going to do if we get stuck?” This isn’t the same as worrying all the time. It’s actually the opposite: planning for bad situations usually gives you more peace of mind. So though astronauts have many abilities (both physical and mental), their core skills are all about solving complex problems, even with incomplete information and in a hostile environment. It’s always better to view criticism as potentially helpful advice rather than a personal attack. For an astronaut, criticism is a basic survival skill. At NASA, everyone has to be a critic. When astronauts work through their simulations, dozens of people watch them, in the hope that they’ll catch any flaws. The more the astronauts are critiqued, the safer they’ll be. Every small blunder is scrutinized to make sure it won’t happen again. Over the years, hundreds of people will critique an astronaut’s performance. It’s a regular part of the job. The goal of all the criticism is to establish a list of Flight Rules that outline the steps to take if any problems arise. These rules prepare the astronauts to face any problems confidently, and they help protect against the temptation to take dangerous gambles. Criticism should never be personal or involve ridicule, however. Even when you have to offer some harsh criticism, it should never be focused on the individual. You should point out the problem in a cool and detached manner, never teasing the person – even when it’s tempting. These rules are useful in all areas of life, but especially in the space business. If a team faces a serious problem – like a medical emergency or equipment failure – they only have each other to depend on for survival. And if your crewmates are the only people in the universe who can save you from some sort of threat, you certainly don’t want them to dislike you because you’ve ridiculed them in the past! So whether you’re in the space business or any other line of work, strive to create an environment where people can learn from their mistakes in constructive ways. The whole team should learn collectively from failures, without anyone being made to feel bad. Missions can last for several months. Naturally, the extended absence required for training and missions is hard for astronauts and their families. From 2007 onward, Hadfield spent six months per year training in Moscow. He also trained in the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada and Kazakhstan. He was only home for about 15 weeks per year, and missed quite a few birthdays and holidays. He effectively became a visitor in his own home. Astronauts have to anticipate these difficult periods, and try to make it up to their families in advance. Before his last mission, Hadfield sat down with a calendar and planned for the times he’d be away. He realized he wouldn’t be there for Valentine’s Day, so he arranged a card and a gift in advance so they’d arrive for his wife on the right day. When he realized his launch overshadowed his son’s 16th birthday, he knew he’d have to do something special. So in interviews he announced that his crew would be lighting the biggest candles – the rocket’s engines – to celebrate the birthday, making his son feel happier. Lots of people have demanding jobs, even if they aren’t astronauts. So if you know you can’t be around much for your loved ones in the future, try to make it up to them in other ways. You’ll feel more connected with them, even when you’re away, and they’ll be reminded that you love them even though you can’t always be there. The International Space Station (ISS) is as big as a football field and weighs over one million pounds. It has so many modules that you can go a full day on board without seeing another person. So what does life in the ISS actually feel like? Well, the quality of life onboard is sort of similar to that on a long sailboat trip. It’s remote and there’s no running water, because water would cohere into blobs, float away and wreck the sophisticated equipment that the ship runs on. Privacy and fresh produce are also in short supply. Hygiene is very basic – obviously there are no long, hot showers. Astronauts must wash their hair by scrubbing their scalps with non-rinse shampoo, then dry it very carefully so stray hairs don’t end up floating all over the spacecraft. They also need to exercise for two hours a day to maintain their muscle strength. If they don’t, they won’t be strong enough to even stand when they get back to Earth. It certainly might be tempting to just float around all day, but it’d be very dangerous. Fun floating aside, an astronaut’s work is very serious. The ISS primarily functions as an enormous laboratory. Astronauts on the ISS spend their time researching ways to venture further into space – and stay alive and healthy while doing so. Their work also applies to other fields, however: experiments and research conducted in space have influenced many fields, including medicine and robotics. Medical experiments in space have revealed methods for warding off one type of osteoporosis, and some of the machinery used inside nuclear power plants is based on machinery developed for the ISS. Data gathered on the ISS also helped power Google Maps. When astronauts have finished their missions, how do they get back to Earth? And how are their lives different once they arrive? Astronauts return to Earth in the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, but Soyuz landings are notoriously rough. Since the American Space Shuttle was withdrawn from service in 2011, the Soyuz has been the only way to reach and depart from the ISS. The return is a very wild ride. The re-entry into the atmosphere is basically a one-hour tumble – nearly everyone who’s experienced it has an extreme story about it. Yuri Malenchenko, for example, said that during his 2008 landing on the Soyuz, the parachute designed to decelerate the re-entry capsule caught fire, and eventually burned up entirely. The crew survived the landing, but they ended up a long way from their intended target, with no one to meet them on the Kazakh Steppe. They eventually met with some locals who, drawn to the smoke, asked, “Where did you come from?” and “What about your boat? Where did the boat come from?” Even after you’ve survived the landing, your body needs time to readapt to gravity again. The general rule of thumb is that it takes a day on Earth to recover from each day in space. When you return to Earth, you feel like your body has aged a lot. After you get used to floating weightlessly in the air, sitting on a chair and feeling your own weight is very uncomfortable. Despite the drawbacks, returning to Earth can be a transformative experience. Many people assume that after astronauts have seen space, life on Earth must be dull. For Hadfield, the opposite has been true: he says he returns home energized, with a new and inspiring view of the world. The key message in this book: Floating in space is incredibly fun, but an astronaut’s work involves much more. If you want to be an astronaut, you’ve got to spend years preparing, hear hundreds of people criticize you, stay away from your family for long periods and endure much physical stress. If you have any trouble in space, no one can come to your rescue except your crewmates. Despite the hardships, however, it’s very rewarding work, and life in space can give you a better perspective on life on Earth. Actionable advice: Plan for the times you’ll be away. Even if you aren’t an astronaut, you’ve probably caught yourself sacrificing time with your loved ones so you can work more. It’s OK if you have to work, but plan for it. If you know you’re going to miss significant dates, or just generally be around less, make it up to your family in other ways. Arrange gifts for them in advance, and send special messages to them. It’ll make the distance much easier to bear.

    "title": "An Elegant Defense",
    "author": "Matt Richtel",
    "summary": "The author, Matt Richtel, put pen to paper when he witnessed a miracle.  His dear friend Jason Greenstein, who’d been on the verge of succumbing to cancer, was cured. Thanks to a new drug that harnesses the powers of the immune system, he was able to beat the unbeatable. That’s when Richtel decided to write An Elegant Defense. The seemingly miraculous recovery of his friend had ignited his imagination. If we could tinker with the human immune system and tap into its awesome power – and with such amazing results! – then what disease couldn’t we conquer? In his book, Richtel went on to lay out the history of immunology – the branch of medicine dedicated to the immune system. And he told that history in an unconventional way, weaving it together with the personal stories of four people whose health conditions dovetail with advances in the field.  In these blinks, we’ll follow Richtel’s lead and take a whirlwind tour of that history, and then we’ll focus on one of those stories – Jason’s, which has an important lesson to teach us about both the progress and the limits of our ability to direct and command our elegant defense. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: the difference between a neutrophil and a dendritic cell; which animals led to the discovery of the immune system; and why it’s dangerous when the immune system overreacts. Imagine a huge party – a massive, rip-roaring carnival with hundreds of billions of attendees. Where is this wild, gargantuan bash with a guest list well over a hundred times larger than Earth’s human population? It’s inside you. The merrymakers are your own cells, as well as billions of bacteria and viruses. This party is what the author calls the Festival of Life. At this festival, making sure everything runs smoothly, are janitors and handymen, security personnel and emergency responders – the cells that constitute your immune system. They are your body’s elegant defense. They attend to tissue damage and clean up toxins. And they fight off malicious intruders known as pathogens. Pathogens are disease-causing agents, and they come in three main forms: bacteria, viruses and parasites. For the purposes of these blinks, we’ll be focusing only on the first two. In their most dangerous forms, you can think of them as tiny little killers. They’re small – really small. You can fit a few thousand bacteria inside one human cell. Viruses are even smaller. A few thousand would fit inside a single bacterium.  But a quick caveat: though some bacteria and viruses are pathogenic, most aren’t. In fact, a mere one percent of all bacteria are likely to cause illness. And as for viruses, some of them are crucial to our survival. For instance, about eight percent of our genetic material was created by retroviruses, a special variety of virus that invades human cells and literally becomes part of our DNA. So viruses and bacteria aren’t inherently bad – far from it. But a handful of them are deadly indeed. Just take the bacterium known as Yersinia pestis. It’s responsible for causing the Black Plague, which killed upward of 30 percent of Europe’s population in the fourteenth century. Some other nasty bacteria include salmonella, E. coli and tetanus bacillus, while the long list of deadly viruses includes Ebola, HIV, smallpox, flu and rabies. Prior to 1900, influenza (a viral infection) and pneumonia (an inflammation that can be viral or bacterial) were major killers, responsible for more deaths out of every 100,000 patients than any other disease. Nowadays, it’s rare to hear of someone dying of the flu. How did we beat back these pathogens? Well, you’re going to get the long answer, which is the story of the discovery of the immune system. The field of immunology can be traced back to a mystery – or, rather, three mysteries: the mysteries of a chicken, a dog and a starfish. Let’s start with the chicken. One day in the sixteenth century, while dissecting a chicken, a young Italian anatomist named Fabricius ab Aquapendente discovered a mysterious organ. Located beneath the bird’s tail, and shaped like a pouch, it served no apparent function. He named it the bursa, a word that’s etymologically related to the English word “purse.” But what was this tiny avian purse good for? No one had a clue. Almost a century later, in 1622, another Italian, Gaspare Aselli, dissected another animal – a dog this time – and encountered yet another enigma. In the animal’s stomach, he found “milky veins,” a discovery that didn’t jibe with the seventeenth-century understanding of the circulatory system. Wasn’t blood supposed to be red? Again, no one could explain this oddity. More than two centuries later, in 1882, yet another discovery was made on Italian soil – though the discoverer this time was a Russian zoologist. Élie Metchnikoff was visiting his sister in Sicily when he had his eureka moment. While working alone one day, Metchnikoff put a spattering of starfish larvae under his microscope. Inside these minute, transparent organisms, he observed what he called “wandering cells” – cells that seemed to drift around the bodies of the starfish. His brain made an instantaneous, revelatory jump. What if these itinerant cells weren’t as purposeless as they appeared? What if they were wandering watchmen, in charge of defending the starfish against intruders? He immediately tested his hypothesis. From the garden he collected some rose thorns and inserted them under the skin of a few starfish larvae. Then he went to bed. The next morning, he observed that the wandering cells had gathered around the thorn – and that they were busily consuming the damaged tissue. Metchnikoff’s experiment led to the phagocyte theory – “phagocyte” is Greek for “devourer of cells” – which posits that, when invaded, the body’s first reaction is to swarm the breach with these devouring cells. This cellular self-consumption is what laypeople call inflammation. But how did the cells know that there had been an invasion? Attempts to answer this question – and to explain the mysteries of the white-blooded dog and the bursa of Fabricius – gave rise to the field of immunology. It was the late 1950s, and Dr. Jacques Miller had a lot of dying mice on his hands. Whenever a new mouse died – and that happened regularly – Dr. Miller would cut it open and see the same thing: a little mouse liver covered in lesions. Each mouse had been ravaged by severe infection. What happened to these poor mice? And who is this scalpel-happy Dr. Miller? Well, he was a French physician working in London, and he had deprived these mice of an organ that, until his experiments with it, was as mysterious as the bursa of Fabricius. This organ is called the thymus. After the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, researchers worldwide began to study leukemia, incidences of which had skyrocketed in those cities. Central to that research were – surprise, surprise – mice. In a grim nutshell, researchers gave mice cancer by exposing them to radiation, hoping to hit upon discoveries that might help irradiated Japanese citizens. During this research, an oddity emerged: some mice, though they hadn’t been irradiated, developed leukemia spontaneously. This spontaneous development took place in the thymus, a tiny organ situated just above the breastbone. Dr. Miller, who’d decided to study leukemia in the early 1950s, was, by the late 1950s, on the verge of making a discovery that would turn this unassuming organ into a central player in the immunological field. In an early experiment, Dr. Miller injected mice with leukemic filtrate, a liquid infused with ground-down cancerous tissue from a leukemic mouse. After injecting both baby and adult mice with this filtrate, he observed something puzzling: the baby mice would develop leukemia; the adult mice wouldn’t. Why? To find out, he began removing mouse thymuses. In subsequent experiments, he injected a newborn mouse with leukemic filtrate, waited for the mouse to reach adulthood, and then replaced its mature thymus with the thymus of a baby mouse. He did this with many mice, and, without fail, they developed leukemia as soon as they were given the immature thymus. He expected he was on to something. The thymus-less baby mice made him certain. As you’ll remember, these poor mice died of infection, against which they’d clearly been rendered utterly defenseless. The thymus, Dr. Miller posited, wasn’t a useless mystery organ; it was a key component of the immune system. What is self and what is alien to self? What is a part of you and what is other? How does the body know, for instance, which bacteria to attack and which to let alone? When Dr. Jacques Miller was conducting his research, there weren’t any definitive answers to such questions, but one thing was certain: the immune system could distinguish between self and non-self, though sometimes it would mistake help for harm. For instance, it was well-known that skin grafts usually went horribly awry. Though it might initially seem to accept the new skin, the human body would ultimately reject the foreign tissue. This knowledge helped Dr. Miller clinch his thesis that the thymus was crucial to the immune system. The body of a normal mouse, endowed with a thymus, would, like a human being, reject skin grafts from other mice. When Dr. Miller grafted skin onto the mice whose thymuses he’d removed, however, there was no such rejection. Indeed, he successfully managed to graft skin from four different mice onto a single mouse, which ended up growing tufts of multicolored fur. Possession of a thymus equaled skin rejection. Lack of a thymus meant no skin rejection. After making this observation, Dr. Miller did an array of blood tests on these thymus-less mice, and he found that all of them had a very low number of a certain type of blood cell – known as a lymphocyte – that has only one nucleus. He deduced that the thymus was responsible for producing these lymphocytes, and so he called them thymus-derived cells, or T cells for short. But the question remained of how these T cells could identify and attack pathogens. Back in 1891, an immunology pioneer named Paul Ehrlich had offered one theory. He thought that certain cells in the human body carried a sort of biological set of “keys” – he called them side-chains – that could fit into corresponding “locks” in the pathogens. Once the human cell found the right key and fitted it into the pathogen’s lock, the body could begin fighting the intruder. He named the keys antibodies and the locks antigens. Dr. Miller assumed he’d discovered the cell central to the immune system – the equivalent of the special key-carrying cells postulated by Ehrlich in the nineteenth century. This assumption – much like Ehrlich’s theory – turned out to be partially true. The whole truth was even more wondrous and complicated. In 1954, the bursa, that pouch-like organ that had so puzzled the young Italian Fabricius ab Aquapendente, finally got its moment in the scientific limelight. A researcher discovered that removing the bursa from chickens severely hindered the animals’ ability to produce antibodies. In other words, if you removed the bursa, you significantly reduced the number of antibodies. Why was this a big deal? Well, it’d been discovered earlier that decade that lacking antibodies meant trouble – big time. In 1951, a very ill boy was brought to Walter Reed General Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. After conducting a series of tests, doctors determined that the boy wasn’t generating antibodies – and they knew he was extremely unwell. He’d had pneumonia 18 times in as many months, not to mention a raft of other deadly infections. This told the doctors, loud and clear, that if you didn’t have antibodies, you were in for an awful time. Now, back in the early 1950s, the details of how antibodies work wasn’t yet understood – but it’d been established that they’re found on lymphocytes, those blood cells that have only one nucleus. But here’s the thing: the boy’s thymus was fine, his blood contained lymphocytes and his body could defend itself against some viruses. In other words, all the known components of the immune system were functioning. So what, exactly, was wrong with him? The conundrum of this boy’s case carried over into the next decade. In the mid-1960s, a physician named Max Cooper began studying an uncommon disorder called Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. People with this condition were, like the boy without antibodies, extremely susceptible to infection. Their immune systems, like the boy’s, barely functioned. Dr. Cooper began conducting autopsies on people who’d had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and, bafflingly, they had plenty of lymphocytes and fully functional thymuses. Then Dr. Cooper had an epiphany: there must be two types of lymphocyte, not one – and each must have its own origin. By that time, Dr. Miller had shown that T cells derive from the thymus. But there had to be another type, and it had to come from somewhere else. If you’re waving your hand in the air, thinking, “I know, I know – the bursa of Fabricius!” then get ready to have your bubble burst. Because humans don’t have a bursa. In the end, after another series of experiments, Dr. Jacques Miller proved Dr. Max Cooper’s hypothesis.  He discovered that there are indeed two types of lymphocytes – T cells and B cells – and that the B cells originate in bone marrow. These cells make up about 40 percent of human white blood cells – cells that, in addition to explaining the mystery of Gaspare Aselli’s white-blooded dog, are absolutely crucial to survival. To explain how B cells and T cells work, let’s imagine you’ve been infected with the flu. Upon infection, your body responds without precision. A bunch of cells – the cells that constitute the other 60 percent of your white blood cells – rush to the site of infection. It’s precisely such cells that Élie Metchnikoff observed swarming inside the wounded starfish larvae. At this point, your body doesn’t really know what it’s defending itself against. And that’s where the T cells and B cells come in: they provide precision. T cells are covered in little spikes, and some of these spikes can recognize pathogens. When that happens, a T cell can either go fight the pathogen itself or send B cells into the fray. B cells, meanwhile, have antibodies. Sitting on the surface of the B cell, an antibody is a protein molecule that can best be imagined as an antenna or a key. Remember Paul Ehrlich’s side-chain theory – the idea that certain cells carry a set of “keys” that can fit into pathogens’ “locks”? Well, the reality is much stranger. Each B cell – and your body has billions and billions of them – is equipped with a single “key” or “antenna” (that’s the antibody) that matches the exact “lock” or “signal” (the antigen) of a single organism. How does a particular antibody find its particular antigen? They’ve got to run into each other – literally. A B cell might roam your body for years – or forever – without finding the antigen to its antibody. How would this look in the case of you and the flu? The virus expresses a certain antigen, and the instant a B cell with the right antibody encounters it – boom! – they bind together, and the B cell destroys it or initiates a wave of other defenses. If you’re wondering how our body knows which antibodies to encode for, then hold on to your hat, because you’re about to find out. Imagine you’re in a foreign country. While there, you take a swim in a lake. A bit of water gets up your nose, and in that water is a malicious bacterium that neither you nor any of your ancestors has ever been exposed to. The antigen it expresses is utterly foreign to your entire system. How can your body possibly possess an antibody that corresponds to it? Meet Susumu Tonegawa, a Japanese researcher who, in the 1970s, while working at the Basel Institute for Immunology, discovered what the author calls the infinity machine. By this point, researchers had established something seemingly obvious. If you took a particular organism – say, a T cell – and isolated a particular section of its genetic material, this section would match the same section of genetic material in other T cells perfectly. Now, Tonegawa had been doing this with B cells – particularly, B cells that were still developing. And when he compared a particular segment of an immature B cell to the same segment in other immature B cells, he got an unsurprising result: the segments matched perfectly. Then the breakthrough came. Tonegawa did the same thing, but instead of comparing the immature B cells to each other, he compared immature B cells to mature B cells. What he observed was remarkable. The genetic material had changed. No other cells work this way – just B cells. In short, the genes that encode antibodies are unique, in the strictest sense of the word. How does this enable your body to detect an alien bacterium? Here’s how: Each immature B cell shares some central genetic material in common – but, in addition to that material, there’s a ton of other genetic material. As the B cell matures, much of that other genetic material falls away. Here’s the twist: each cell loses different genetic material. A huge bundle of genetic coding homes in on a specific genetic strand. This process enables our bodies to produce trillions of different antibodies. To use the lock-and-key metaphor again, our B cells carry keys so strange and specific that they may never meet their lock. Indeed, such locks may not even exist. By producing an infinity of solutions, our bodies can face the infinite threats of the world – and then some. When your body is invaded by a pathogen, an array of defenses is set in motion. You’re now in a position to understand how these defenses combine. First, the generic defense. Remember the phagocytic cells observed by Élie Metchnikoff? Well, they come in a variety of different forms. One of these is the neutrophil. These cells constitute about 50 or 60 percent of your white blood cells, and they’re naturally drawn to infection. When they reach the infected site, they inject the pathogen with an enzyme that destroys it. The neutrophil, as though exhausted by this strife, then begins to dissolve. Interesting fact: pus is composed of dead, dissolved neutrophils. After this, other cells come in and begin cleaning up the mess left by the neutrophils. Meanwhile, the targeted defense is already underway: dendritic cells, which are covered in tiny branch-like protrusions (dendron means “tree” in Greek), carry a sample of the intruder to T cells, which then decide whether it’s benign or malignant. Either that happens, or a roaming T cell or B cell encounters the intruder directly. These cells then fit lock into key and, if the invader is deemed dangerous, set off a highly precise defense, producing defenders trained to fight the intruder. But this raises yet another puzzling question: How can T cells and B cells tell friend from foe? You know that B cells possess antibodies capable of binding with pretty much any antigen. But it’s not only pathogens that express antigens; friendly bacteria express them too. So how does your body differentiate between the two? This question was answered in the 1990s, after two pioneering researchers, Ruslan Medzhitov and Charles Janeway, discovered that we essentially have two immune systems. You’re now familiar with the adaptive immune system. It can learn. Once it’s exposed to a particular pathogen, it remembers, and becomes better at fighting this pathogen in the future. However, though B cells and T cells can recognize billions of antigens, they have no way of knowing whether to attack without input from a second system, known as the innate immune system. Central to this system is the Toll-like receptor. This receptor, which appears on, among other cells, dendritic cells, is able to recognize generic pathogenic traits – things like nucleic acids, which are associated with viral infections, and a type of large molecule characteristic of particular bacteria. Once a cell with a Toll-like receptor detects a pathogenic trait, it sends a confirmatory message to the T cells – Enemy! – which then, like generals, begin directing other cells to go wage war. By now, you’ve got a pretty firm grasp of how the immune system works. There’s one more component – how cells communicate with one another. Your body is essentially equipped with an all-natural telecommunications system. It works like this. The body’s cells are capable of communicating with one another by secreting a protein called a cytokine. For instance, if your body has been invaded by a pathogen, cells near the invasion will release cytokines that pass news of the intruder to other cells. This news can spread through the entire body in mere hours. Cytokines can be thought of as messengers. But they don’t carry messages; they are the message. If there’s been a pathogenic invasion, the message is to attack. Take, for example, the cytokine known as interferon. Let’s say you’ve inhaled a virus. When a healthy cell determines that there’s an invader, it will release interferon, which makes it harder for the virus to proliferate. Other healthy cells pick up on the interferon, and begin generating more of it, thus making life difficult for the invading virus. But here’s the thing: interferon has some unpleasant side effects. You know what it’s like to have a virus, right? You start to feel awful. Your skin aches. You suddenly feel drained of energy. Well, it’s not the virus that makes you feel this way – it’s the interferon. By making you feel achy, hot and weary, your body is encouraging you to rest so it can mount a defense. Not all cytokines tell your body to go on the offensive, however. Many of them are there to ensure our immune systems don’t overreact.  Such regulatory cytokines are called interleukins. These cells actually discourage your immune system from attacking. The immune system has to maintain a fine balance. After all, it can’t dispose of malicious invaders by nuking the entire Festival of Life. It can’t mount an indiscriminate attack. If it did, you’d die. It has to be extremely careful, targeting only malicious organisms while protecting the rest. As you’ll learn in the next blink, however, malignant organisms can use this fact to their advantage, co-opting the body’s defenses and employing them for their own villainous purposes. It’s time to meet Jason Greenstein. Jason and the author had been friends since childhood – and Jason had always been a vibrant human being, living life his own way. As a teenager, he was a talented athlete, dominating the basketball court, but he never flaunted his skills or mocked less able players. He always encouraged the author, for instance, who was not nearly as physically adroit as Jason. As an adult, he became a serial entrepreneur, driving all over the United States in his busted-up van, pursuing one eccentric idea after the next. All that is to say that Jason was alive. So it was a shock when death came knocking. Jason was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma when he was in his forties. This is a cancer of the immune system. It’s called lymphoma because it attacks the lymphatic system. You’re probably familiar with lymph nodes – those tiny lumps that, if you palpate the right spot, you can feel on either side of you neck, just beneath your jaw, as well as in your armpits and other places. These nodes are sort of like command centers for your immune cells. The lymphatic system is like a series of highways along which they can travel. Hodgkin’s lymphoma lodges in this system, fooling your defensive cells into thinking it’s one of them. It does this by attacking B cells, turning them malignant and then using them to control the immune system. Here’s how: All T cells have a receptor called PD, which stands for programmed death. When it needs to, this receptor tells the T cell to self-destruct. Why would it do this? Well, as you know, the immune system needs to maintain a balance between aggression and regulation, so it must be capable of destroying as well as producing cells. Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells have a ligand – a molecule that binds to cell receptors – called PDL-1. Like cloaked assassins, the malignant B cells roam the lymphatic system, binding to healthy T cells and instructing them to commit cellular suicide. Meanwhile, the immune system doesn’t recognize these assassins as foreign, and protects them. Cell by cell, the cancer takes over the immune system. Here’s the good news: this type of cancer tends to respond well to chemotherapy. About 90 percent of all cases are curable with chemo. Here’s the bad news: Jason belonged to that other ten percent. Jason had always been a fighter. So he fought. He did chemotherapy – then, when he went into remission, another bout of chemo. When that didn’t work, he had a bone marrow transplant, which wiped out the cancerous B cells (and the healthy ones, too). Still, the cancer came back. These procedures are devastating in the extreme. Jason’s ability to produce normal blood cells had been severely compromised, and he was neutropenic, meaning he had critically low levels of neutrophils, the white blood cells that act as the body’s first responders. Jason was desolate, his body utterly decimated. Giving up began to sound better than fighting on. Indeed, he was too weak to undergo any further approved treatments. Then – a miracle. Jason’s physician obtained one-time permission to treat him with a new drug that hadn’t been approved for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Called nivolumab, the drug essentially countermands the cancer’s instructions. Rather than being told to self-destruct, the immune system is told to attack. It was far from certain that the treatment would work. Jason’s physician told him his chance of surviving was one in twelve million. But he did survive. Before the treatment, Jason had had a huge tumor on his back. A month after starting nivolumab, his tumor was gone, and he’d lost 15 pounds, which is how much the tumor had weighed. Six weeks after starting the drug, Jason was in complete remission. This is where Jason’s story should end – and, indeed, it’s the moment when the author decided to write a study of the immune system. But interfering on behalf of the immune system is as deadly as leaving malignant cancer untreated. After the remission, Jason underwent a risky treatment. His stem cells were replaced with his sister’s. Quite literally, he received a new immune system. He seemed and felt better for a while. Then the complications set in. They were small complications at first, then larger ones. In June of 2016, a bit more than a year after his nivolumab treatment, his liver failed, a sign that his immune system was waging war against his body. He experienced extreme inflammation, indicative of a cytokine storm – a huge, chaotic response to perceived invasion, which sends the immune system into overdrive. It can easily kill you. Jason took his last breath on August 10, 2016, overwhelmed by his body’s own defenses. Jason’s story may not have a moral. But it does tell us this: our immune system, the most powerful, elegant defense system known to humankind, can also be utterly deadly. We tamper with it at our own risk. The key message in these blinks: The immune system must maintain a delicate balance. If it’s too aggressive, it can kill us; if it’s not aggressive enough, it leaves us vulnerable to malignant pathogens. The field of immunology has a rich and fascinating history, and its pioneers laid the foundation for the incredible immunotherapies that are being developed today. Still, though our knowledge of the immune system has increased exponentially over the last hundred years, we’re far from being able to control our elegant defense. Actionable advice: Don’t stress, and get plenty of sleep! When you’re stressed, your body produces adrenaline, a hormone that, among other stimulating effects, increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Long ago, when humankind’s main stressors were animal predators, this was a good thing: adrenaline makes you alert and ready to run. Nowadays, though, our stressors – such as work deadlines – usually aren’t life-threatening. But here’s the thing: adrenaline can be addictive. The author learned this firsthand. He got hooked on a high-stress work routine, burning the candle at both ends and riding the rush of stress-induced adrenaline. The consequences weren’t pleasant. This pattern disrupted his immune system’s fine balance, and he became severely depressed. He was able to achieve balance again by sleeping – the body shuts down its adrenaline-producing system when you sleep – and meditating. So if you’re struggling with stress, try to follow his lead.

What to read next: On Immunity, by Eula Biss As you now know, the immune system can learn. T cells and B cells can bind to pathogens and then develop precise defenses against them – defenses that stay in place in case that same pathogen attempts to invade in the future. This is how vaccines work. By injecting a small amount of a pathogenic virus into our body, we give our immune system the chance to devise defenses against it. But vaccines are a hot-button topic. Despite the fact that they’ve saved millions of lives from diseases such as polio, many people distrust them, believing that they cause autism and other forms of mental impairment.  Interested in the cultural history underlying people’s misapprehensions? Wondering how to tell fact from falsehood in the vaccine debate? Then we highly recommend checking out the blinks to On Immunity, by Eula Biss.",

    "title": "Anatomy of an Epidemic",
    "author": "Robert Whitaker",
    "summary": "Do you have friends who take medication for depression, anxiety or other mental health issues? Or maybe you take such medications yourself? Most people will answer yes to at least one of these questions. In fact, the modern upswing in mental health issues is so drastic that it almost constitutes an epidemic. How did we get here? We’re familiar with viral or bacterial epidemics. Indeed, they’re the most common. But epidemics needn’t stem from infectious diseases. This is the story of how chance, private interests, the pharmaceutical industry, legislators and physicians got caught up in an intricate dance that resulted in a plague of mental illness that’s consuming America. In these blinks, you’ll learn how psychoactive drugs were invented; why psychiatry’s low status led to mass medication; and that government spending on mental health has almost tripled in 14 years. It’s more than likely that you or someone you know takes a prescription medicine for emotional or psychiatric reasons. The statistics paint a pretty clear picture: One out of every eight Americans takes psychiatric medication – including children and infants. This wasn’t always the case: between 1985 and 2008, the yearly sales of antidepressants and antipsychotics in the United States increased nearly fiftyfold, eventually reaching a whopping $24.2 billion. That’s big business today, but to trace this phenomenon back to its beginning, we need to look at how such drugs were introduced. Today, psychoactive drugs are used to treat conditions such as anxiety, depression and mania. But that wasn’t their intended purpose. Originally, doctors were looking for so-called “magic bullets,” or miracle cures, to fight infectious diseases. But in this search they inadvertently invented something else. In the post-World War II era, between 1954 and 1957, researchers stumbled upon different compounds that affected the central nervous system. While testing the efficacy of these drugs against disease, the researchers found that some of them could dramatically curb a person’s normal physical and emotional responses without causing a loss of consciousness. This isn’t how drugs are normally developed. Usually, research is devoted to finding a cause for an ailment, followed by the development of a medication that will cure the effects of that ailment. This is how insulin therapy was developed, once research showed that diabetes was caused by insulin deficiency. But since the new psychoactive drugs weren’t designed with any particular ailment in mind, they weren’t tested well before going to market. The pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline & French tested its new mental illness magic bullet, Thorazine, on less than 150 psychiatric patients before applying for FDA approval. The company’s president nevertheless claimed that Thorazine had been thoroughly tested on over 5,000 animals and had “proved active and safe for human administration.” In 1954, it was put on the US market and advertised as a treatment for schizophrenia, anxiety and bipolar disorder. One of the biggest problems with limited testing is that it doesn’t allow time for a medication’s possible side effects to emerge. And we now know that psychoactive drugs have side effects in spades. When psychiatric medications are used for long periods of time, they can cause significant and long-lasting changes to a person’s neural functions. After just a few weeks on a psychoactive drug, the brain’s natural defenses begin to weaken, which is when side effects start to manifest. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These result in an increase in serotonin, a naturally produced bio-chemical that aids the function of the brain and nerve cells. In excess, however, it can also cause episodes of mania. Antipsychotic medications, on the other hand, work by blocking a specific neurotransmitter called dopamine. But reducing dopamine can have unpleasant side effects, too. Those who suffer from Parkinson’s disease also have low dopamine levels, so it’s no surprise that people taking antipsychotics experience tremors and impaired motor function. Other common side effects include memory loss and reduced learning ability, as well as weight gain, suicidal thoughts and apathy. These symptoms are often treated with yet more drugs, leaving many patients with a daily cocktail of pills. The prescriptions tend to snowball. Say you take an SSRI and end up feeling manic. This results in your being diagnosed with manic depression. So you get treated with an additional antipsychotic drug, which might cause another symptom. And so on. It’s not unheard of for patients to take six psychoactive drugs per day. Evidence of other adverse side effects continues to emerge. For instance, neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen published a paper connecting antipsychotic drugs to brain shrinkage, suggesting a direct correlation between dosage, duration of intake and reduction in brain size. Another problem is getting patients off the drugs, as withdrawal can send the brain’s chemicals into shock. When people stop taking the SSRI Celexa, their serotonin levels fall dramatically. And being taken off antipsychotics can cause dopamine levels to skyrocket. This can lead to a slew of side effects: insomnia, apathy, suicidal thoughts, mania – symptoms that are hard to distinguish from a patient’s pre-treatment condition and can result in their being put back on the medication. Ultimately, withdrawal can result in months of agony, highlighted by seizures and panic attacks. As we’ve seen, sales of psychiatric drugs have risen sharply in recent years. So it stands to reason that diagnoses of mental disorders have risen in tandem with those numbers. Since 1955, when these drugs were first introduced, the number of mentally disabled people has risen dramatically. It’s also worth noting the rise in mentally disabled people who also qualify for federal assistance, such as Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance. Between 1987 and 2007, this number more than doubled, going from one in every 184 Americans to one in every 76. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) is responsible for setting the criteria that determine mental illness in the United States and they’ve established four broad categories: Anxiety disorders, including phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mood disorders, such as severe depression and bipolar disorder. Impulse-control disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). And, finally, substance-use disorders, including alcoholism and drug abuse. These categories are so wide ranging that, between 2001 and 2003, the National Institute of Mental Health conducted a massive survey and found that 46 percent of the population met the criteria of at least one mental illness. Most of them met the criteria for multiple diagnoses. Perhaps more disturbingly, there’s been a mind-boggling rise in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness in children. In the 20 years between 1987 and 2007, the number of children diagnosed with a mental disorder has increased more than thirtyfold, with some patients being as young as two years old. As a result, mental illness is now the number one disability in children, and ten percent of all ten-year-old boys take medication for ADHD, while approximately 500,000 children in the United States overall take some form of antipsychotic drug. Remember that these psychiatric medications were intended to be a “magic bullet,” a perfect cure that could kill an infectious disease. And yet they’ve created more problems than they’ve solved. Part of the issue is that the mental health community quickly began over-prescribing these medications, even giving them to patients for whom the drugs were never approved. This especially applies to children, who often receive treatment that includes drugs that aren’t FDA approved for their age group and that may lead to severe side effects. While the drugs can provide short-term relief for some symptoms, they can also cause long-term harm to the brain’s chemistry, and this damage can persist long after the original symptoms would have naturally subsided. Therefore, treatments for schizophrenia and depression can actually make the symptoms far worse. Before medication, someone with schizophrenia may have had episodes that lasted a maximum of six months, offset by extended periods of normalcy. But after treatment, these episodes can become lifelong and chronic. This isn’t the case for everyone. Many people do benefit from regularly using antidepressants. However, before the overprescription of these drugs became so widespread, many people would recover from their symptoms and go on to lead healthy lives. Today, on the other hand, there’s a large number of patients who’ve been placed on long-term drug therapy and now find themselves chronically ill. Indeed, rather than offering extensive data in support of psychiatric drugs, research actually shows them to be counterproductive. Jonathan Cole, often referred to as the father of American psychopharmacology, wrote a paper in 1977 called “Is the Cure Worse Than the Disease?” Cole reviewed the evidence of long-term damage caused by psychoactive drugs, including studies which showed how at least half of all schizophrenic patients could live fruitful lives without them. He conceded that antipsychotics were not the “magic bullet,” or the life-saving drugs, that psychopharmacologists had hoped they were. Further supporting Cole’s paper was a 1998 study by the World Health Organization; it showed that long-term use of antidepressants was associated with an increased – not a reduced – risk of long-term depression. To fully understand why the mental health field is in such disarray, it’s important to consider the impact that these new drugs had on psychiatry itself. Prior to the drugs’ introduction, psychiatrists were not concerned with brain chemistry and neurotransmitters; they were completely focused on Freudian analysis. They saw any mental illness as stemming from unconscious conflicts, often originating in childhood – conflicts that caused emotional problems which were separate from the physical aspects of the brain. But this changed with the arrival of psychoactive drugs. Psychiatrists shifted their attention to the brain, and they started caring less and less about the life stories of their patients. This new approach began in the 1950s, when psychiatrists became primarily concerned with identifying symptoms and eliminating or reducing them with brain-altering medication. An initial sense of hope accompanied the advent of these drugs, but this optimism soon soured. In the 1970s, the severe side effects began to become apparent. Meanwhile, the anti-psychiatry movement kicked into gear, entering the popular imagination with the publication of Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Psychiatrists were also facing growing competition from other professionals, including psychologists and social workers, who treated patients without medication. Some psychiatrists rejected the medical approach altogether. Some still clung to the Freudian model, and there were even those who regarded mental illness as a sane response to an increasingly insane world. These internal divisions further weakened the profession. The lack of unity didn’t help psychiatry’s image. Within the larger medical family, psychiatrists were like a band of unpopular cousins. Despite their fancy new drugs, they were still considered less scientific than other specialists. And they generally earned less than their peers. So what’s a profession to do when it’s crumbling and considered a joke by other professions? We’ll find out in the next blink. After years of inner and outer turmoil, psychiatry eventually struck back. In the 1970s, the psychiatric profession underwent a radical re-branding. They launched a full media and public-relations campaign to assert their medical legitimacy and enhance their status. As part of their campaign, the APA planned to publish the third edition of their Diagnostic and Status Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This is the guidebook that lays out the diagnostic criteria for every recognized mental disorder. The first two editions, published in 1952 and 1968, were largely unknown outside the profession, and they still reflected the old Freudian view of mental illness. To make sure the third edition, known as DSM-III, accurately reflected their new point of view, the president of the APA hired Robert Spitzer, an admired psychiatry professor at Columbia University, to head the task force composing the manual. Published in 1980, the new and improved DSM-III contained 265 diagnoses, a significant increase from the 182 in the previous edition. And it quickly became a universal tool for a wide array of professions, from insurance companies, hospitals and courts to schools, government agencies and the larger medical community. It offered something many people were looking for: a consistent guide to psychiatric diagnosis, a tool that allowed different professionals presented with the same patient to discern the same problem. It did this by breaking down each diagnosis with a list of symptoms and certain numerical thresholds. So, to meet the criteria for a certain mood disorder, you might need to have at least five of the nine symptoms listed. The main goal of DSM-III, however, was to justify the use of psychiatric medications. All licensed psychiatrists have passed their medical board exams and thus qualify as doctors with the authority to write prescriptions. But after the introduction of psychoactive drugs, some psychiatrists were starting to call themselves by a different name: psychopharmacologists. This terminology was another effort to lend credence to the myth that drugs could fix any mental illness by adjusting the brain’s “chemical imbalance.” Their re-branding largely worked as intended, and, as we’ll see in the next blink, psychiatry was an especial darling of the pharmaceutical industry. It’s no secret that the income of a doctor can rapidly rise with the ability to prescribe pharmaceuticals. Between 1950 and 1970, the income of physicians doubled, thanks largely to the increase in available prescription drugs. Even the American Medical Association brought in ad revenue from drug manufacturers by selling space in their magazine, revenue that rose from $2.5 million to $10 million in just the ten years between 1950 and 1960. These ads always paint a rosy picture. But they often don’t tell the complete story about the drugs they’re selling. For instance, in 1959 it was found that 89 percent of the ads contained no information at all about possible side effects. The relationship between pharmaceutical companies and the APA eventually grew to include sponsored scientific symposiums. These quickly became the APA’s most popular events. Drug companies would provide lavish dinners and pay handsomely for a “panel of experts” to give testimonials about the effectiveness of certain drugs. While these panels claimed to be “educational,” they were nothing more than well-rehearsed advertisements; if someone dared to talk about things like side effects, they were never invited back. If you were considered a star in your field, perhaps a psychiatrist at one of the top medical schools, you could earn between $2,000 and $10,000 per speech. The APA was earning good money as well, raking in millions of dollars from various partnerships with drug companies. Revenues in 1980 were around $10.5 million; by 1987, that number had risen to $21.4 million. At this point, they opened a new office in Washington and were even talking openly about how pharmaceutical corporations were “partners in industry.” Yet, while the APA and its experts were getting rich, the American public was paying the cost. In 2009, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that the personal costs of mental health services were rising faster than any other medical category. In 2008, US citizens spent $170 billion on mental health services, twice as much as they paid in 2001. And it’s expected to climb to $280 billion in 2015. That’s a 240-percent increase since 2001. Medicaid and Medicare programs pay for approximately 60 percent of these services, so in the end even perfectly healthy taxpayers wind up footing the bill. The key message in this book: The history of psychoactive drugs is a disturbing one. Today, pharmaceutical companies and the psychiatry profession are complicit in a corrupt relationship to promote these drugs, and there’s only scant evidence to back up their claims that what they’re peddling will cure mental illness.

    "title": "Astroball",
    "author": "Ben Reiter",
    "summary": "Passion and instinct shape sports. Whether it’s the diehard fans in the stands, the dedicated players on the field or the grizzled old-school coach pacing the sidelines, the people who live and breathe sports tend to project a certain message – that success in the game rests on grit, determination and raw talent. But that’s changing. Today’s top clubs are increasingly embracing something we don’t usually associate with sports – math. Take it from the Houston Astros, a baseball outfit whose meteoric rise from mid-table mediocrity to World Series champion was driven by a managerial revolution. At its heart were two forward-thinking innovators, Californian data analyst Sig Mejdal and scout Jeff Luhnow, both of whom realized that baseball, like other games, can be understood statistically. In the face of opposition from skeptics and proponents of good old “gut instinct,” Mejdal and Luhnow started following the data. The results were stunning. Soon enough, the Astros were gaming the market and signing overlooked talents whose unique skill sets laid the foundations for the club’s title-winning season in 2017. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how technology is reshaping American baseball; why the most successful clubs champion inclusivity; and what big data sometimes misses. In the late 1980s, Sig Mejdal, a Californian student and future NASA engineer, was paying his way through college by working night shifts at a casino. It was at the blackjack tables that he noticed something important: gamers usually trust their gut over reason. Blackjack is a game of probability. The player’s aim is to beat the dealer’s hand without his own hand exceeding 21. Despite the superstitions of players, there’s always a statistically preferable option when it comes to choosing to draw another card. Say a player has a hand amounting to 16. In most cases, he’ll be wary about drawing another card. After all, the chance of going bust – getting more than 21 – is pretty high, right? Well, yes, but there’s more to it. In fact, reason tells us the best move is to take another card. There’s a 74-percent chance the dealer has a winning hand of at least 17. Draw another card, however, and the player’s chance of defeat drops to 67.5 percent! That got Mejdal thinking. What, he wondered, would happen if you applied the same logic to other games. He started looking more closely at baseball. His hypothesis? Since it’s a game just like any other, math might be more reliable than gut instinct. It was an insight that paid dividends in one area in particular: player recruitment. Mejdal proved this in 2005 during his stint as an advisor to Jeff Luhnow, the scouting director at the Missouri-based St. Louis Cardinals. Mejdal’s data on player performance metrics told him that the best college player in the United States was Jed Lowrie of the Stanford Cardinals. Scouts had – literally – overlooked Lowrie because of his slight stature. Their gut instincts told them he was simply too small and slender to make it as a major league player. Luhnow, however, decided to follow Mejdal’s advice and take a gamble on Lowrie, recruiting him to the Cardinals team. The result? Lowrie went on to become an all-star player with a relatively dependable batting average of .262 in 2018 in addition to his high skills as a defensive player in the shortstop position! In 2012, scout Jeff Luhnow and his analyst Sig Mejdal were recruited by the Houston Astros. It wasn’t long before the duo started shaking things up. Thanks to technological advancements, compiling previously unimaginably detailed performance metrics was now a breeze, letting the team make smarter recruiting decisions. Take the video camera system PITCHf/x, which started being used in all major league baseball games in 2006. By triangulating between three fixed cameras, the system can calculate everything from the speed the ball is pitched at to the point it’s thrown from, as well as how strong its spin is and where it crosses the batting plate. The Astros put all that data to good use when they recruited pitcher Collin McHugh from the Colorado Rockies in 2013. McHugh’s overall performance metrics were pretty average, but PITCHf/x showed that he had an ace up his sleeve – he occasionally threw extraordinary curveballs with more than 2,000 revolutions per minute, way more than the average of 1,500. The Astros gambled that McHugh would become a more consistent player and put him on the team. The result? He went on to become one of their best pitchers. Sig Mejdal was meanwhile developing complex algorithms to support player-selection decisions. His team of analysts compiled a database of player metrics based on information gathered by the Astros’ scouts on potential recruits’ health history, individual performance, playing style and personality. What Mejdal wanted to find out was whether the scouts’ evaluations were reliable. He realized that comparing their ratings to the players’ actual performances was a great way of weeding out decisions based on prejudice or bias. Do that, Mejdal showed, and you’d be able to craft a more objective recruitment policy geared toward finding players who were most likely to become high performers. As you can imagine, this newfangled approach didn’t go down well with traditional scouts who’d long been used to relying on their instincts to pick players. But despite the doubts of naysayers, it worked. Mejdal’s system was key to the Astros’ 2017 World Series title. His recommendations helped build a team that racked up 101 wins and only 61 losses in 2017. In mid-2012, the Astros’ public relations office prepared biographies of the high school players the team regarded as likely recruits. But when the selections were made, there were quite a few surprises. The reason? Scouting duo Jeff Luhnow and Sig Mejdal’s unique approach. Let’s start with the question of age. Most baseball buffs thought the Astros would pick Byron Buxton, a player who’d already made a name for himself and proved his talents. Luhnow, however, wasn’t having any of it and instead plumped for someone with a much more low-key profile: Carlos Correa. Correa, a defensive fielding specialist like Buxton, had shown promise, but his performance stats were solid rather than outstanding. Plenty of scouts would have been turned off by that, but Sig Mejdal had seen something others hadn’t – his algorithms, which gave Correa top marks thanks to his strong defensive performances. Then there was the question of age. Correa was just shy of 18 when the Astros signed him, a good nine months younger than Buxton. Mejdal’s data showed that every month in age difference matters to players’ – and their teams’ – long-term prospects. Signing top talent young can make all the difference. It was another insight that paid dividends. While Buxton’s performance with the Minnesota Twins peaked between 2013 and 2014 before dipping in 2015, Correa simply got better and better. Picking young talents who have their best years ahead of them is also a financially savvy move. Simply put, they earn a lot less than experienced players. That’s a boon in baseball, a sport that strictly regulates expenditure on new signings and caps it at a certain sum per every ten new players. This system means that a team’s first new signing – in this case, Correa – typically gets the largest slice of the pie, limiting how much can be spent on other players. But since he was young and inexperienced, that didn’t apply to Correa. In fact, the Astros landed their new fielder by promising him a draft bonus of $4.8 million – much less than the expected $7.2 million. The upshot? The Astros filled a key position and had enough spare change to recruit top players for other positions! Baseball, like lots of games, is a sentimental affair. Just ask the Astros’ scouting director, Jeff Luhnow. Every season, he receives letters and emails from young fans begging him to hire or not hire their favorite players. There’s nothing wrong with emotion in sports – after all, we play and watch games because we love them. But sound recruitment policy requires a more hardheaded approach. The reason is simple. Relying on data rather than sentiment or instinct produces better results. That’s something the Astros know all about. In 2006, long before Sig Mejdal’s brought his algorithms to the Astros, the team already struck gold by relying on data. They found José Altuve, a Venezuelan defensive fielder known to his teammates as “the midget” due to his small size. Altuve was by all accounts a talented player and had already tried out for several major teams. But his stature was a problem. After each tryout, he’d inevitably be sent home after being told that a five-foot-five player would never make it in the major league. That changed when he tried out for the Astros. The team’s scouts and algorithm were impressed by Altuve’s speed. He was definitely small, but he could cover a lot of ground – 60 yards in just 6.31 seconds, to be precise. He was also a talented batter, hitting virtually every ball that came his way despite the common prejudice that smaller players have trouble doing just that. The team believed the figures and signed Altuve, who received a small draft bonus of $15,000 and – more importantly – an opportunity to play in one of the Astros’ affiliated minor league teams. He didn’t disappoint. By 2011, he had an impressive batting average of .327 and was asked to join the Astros in the major league. It was another triumph for data-driven scouting. Altuve was aggressive, swinging at 55 percent of all pitches, but better yet, he hit a whopping 88 percent of them – more, in other words, than top sluggers like Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero! Traditional recruitment methods would have missed this extraordinarily talented, pint-sized baseball player. But it wasn’t just the Astros who benefitted. Altuve’s performance was so impressive that he was soon offered $12.5 million to stay on and play for the team over the next four seasons. Top athletes often earn more money in a week than most people do in an entire year, to say nothing of the head-turning bonuses that come their way when they’re successful. But being a professional sportsman isn’t just about laughing all the way to the bank. In fact, the athletic trade is a uniquely vulnerable one due to the threat of injuries. Pre-existing health issues sometimes finish off careers before they’ve even really started. Take it from Brady Aiken, a young player drafted by the Astros. When Aiken arrived in Houston for his medical examination, he was on the verge of fame and fortune. A few tests later, however, and his dream had been shattered. The examiners discovered a weak ulnar collateral ligament in his arm – a ligament placed under high stress in baseball. The risk of it rupturing was too great and Aiken was sent home. It was a tough call, but it had to be made despite the fact that the Astros’ scouts loved the way Aiken played. But the Astros couldn’t simply turn Aiken away. Getting out of their agreement with him without losing a ton of money required plenty of savvy. Why? Well, if this happened, Aiken was entitled to compensation for his loss. That would have amounted to 40 percent of his signing bonus value. And for Aiken, that bonus was worth $7.9 million, meaning Aiken stood to receive a cool $3.1 million. The Astros gambled – correctly, as it turned out – that Aiken would reject this offer of compensation. After all, what he wanted wasn’t just money; he wanted to play baseball. As long as he didn’t take the compensation, there was a chance another team would recruit him. If that happened, the Astros would receive a transfer fee, thus freeing up resources for a different player. It was the right decision for the Astros. In 2015, Aiken’s ulnar collateral ligament ruptured during a game for the Florida-based IMG Baseball Academy, just as the Astros’ medics had predicted. Aiken was later drafted by the Cleveland Indians, but his injury held him back. Meanwhile, the Astros recruited Alex Bregman in Aiken’s stead, a new player who would become a core component of their team. What makes the greatest athletes, well, great? They improve with age, taking their natural talent and complementing it with their growing experience of the game. Baseball is no exception. Every player hopes for constant growth and development. But not all careers pan out that way. Sometimes players start to plateau. Take JD Martinez, a batter from Florida selected by the Astros in the twentieth round of the 2009 draft. Once he had his foot in the door of the minor leagues, he started to shine. Within two years, he’d been selected for the major league team. By 2012, he was one of the best players in a struggling Astros team and their most consistent point-winning batter. A year later, however, things started slowing down. Martinez’s stats began to suffer. His batting average declined to .251 and he hit a paltry 24 home runs over the season. What was going on? As the team’s hitting coach John Mallee noted, Martinez was stagnating. If he really wanted to become a great player, he had to make changes. Carry on the same way for much longer, Mallee warned, and he’d fall off the map of US baseball entirely. Martinez followed Mallee’s advice and decided to work on improving his game. When he sprained his wrist just a few weeks later, he took advantage of his time off the playing field to watch some of the world’s best sluggers from the stands. Few players were better than the Milwaukee Brewers’ Ryan Braun. Watching Braun hitting balls out of the park, Martinez noticed that his swinging style didn’t match Braun’s. Whereas he swung his bat downward, Braun – like other top talents – had a tendency to swing upwards so that the bat’s finishing position was higher. Once his wrist had healed up, Martinez headed to California for a couple of months of intensive training with specialist batting coaches. By the time he reappeared on the field in 2014, his batting average was up to .312. Unluckily for him, however, the Astros remained unconvinced and fired him. That was their mistake. When Martinez moved on to the Detroit Tigers, he upped his average to .444 and became the player of the month in June 2014. Most major league baseball players belong to two broad groups – those whose first language is English and those whose mother tongue is Spanish. The division between them might be invisible in most locker rooms, but it’s there all the same. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, clubs that overcome the linguistic divide often develop a much stronger team spirit. Take Carlos Beltrán, a Puerto Rican player who didn’t speak a word of English when he first joined the American baseball leagues in 1998. It wasn’t just language that posed a problem, however; racial prejudice also prevented bonds between Caucasian and Hispanic players. That left a lasting impression on Beltrán. When, between 2016 and 2017, he played for the Astros as a veteran 40-year-old player, he was determined to help create the kind of inclusive atmosphere at the club that had been missing earlier on in his career. That was easier said than done, but Beltrán found an ally in Alex Bregman, a Caucasian player who’d been with the Astros since 2015. Bregman claimed that he spoke perfect Spanish. That turned out to be a white lie, but there was no doubting that he genuinely wanted to get to know the team’s Hispanic players, including stars like Altuve and Correa. His enthusiasm was so great that soon enough other players joined in, making efforts to improve their English or Spanish skills. As the linguistic boundaries dissolved, a new team spirit began to take shape. That was great for the Astros’ sporting performance. After all, many of the team’s top performers were like Yuli Gurriel, a talented Cuban first baseman who didn’t speak a word of English when he moved to Houston in 2016. Bregman again took the lead, making sure to chat to Gurriel in Spanish and help the new signee fit in socially. Between them, Beltrán and Bregman created a sense of inclusion that boosted the team’s performance on the field. And 2017 ended up being the club’s most successful season ever, with a total of 101 wins. Data and sophisticated algorithms helped the Astros become one of the best baseball teams in the American Major League. But the club’s success wasn’t merely driven by tech. Data might be able to do a lot, but it’s worth remembering that it can’t do everything. One area in which it sometimes comes up short is player valuations. Take an example from 2017. The Astros had the opportunity to sign Justin Verlander, one of the best pitchers in the country. Great news, right? Well, there was a catch – he would cost the club $40 million for two seasons. Sig Mejdal’s algorithm suggested the deal wasn’t worth it. What it failed to pick up on, however, was the changing economic climate in the major league. Prices were rising everywhere, and fast. Star players like David Price and Zack Greinke were making $30 million a year on four-year contracts. Put into perspective, Verlander actually looked like a pretty good deal. For less than the cost of many other players, the Astros would get one of the most celebrated pitchers of all time. Jeff Luhnow, the club’s sporting director, had made plenty of decisions based on Mejdal’s data, but this time he overruled the algorithm and moved to sign Verlander. It wasn’t a bad call. Today, he’s a seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star player! Another aspect the algorithm missed was the possibility that Verlander, who seemed to be at the top of his game, might continue improving. That’s not surprising because future performance is generally something that is tricky to forecast accurately based on past performance. Top players are hard to put a price tag on since they’re so adaptable and their playing styles keep changing. How, for example, is an algorithm supposed to predict the fact that Verlander’s signature sliding pitch would be undermined by new, higher velocity balls, or that he’d respond to that change by once again upping his game and crafting a new technique? Statistics, data and mathematics already play a massive role in major league baseball and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. And teams like the Astros have shown what can be achieved when you put your trust in data rather than gut instinct. But it’s worth remembering that there’s still plenty of space for a more human touch. The key message in these blinks: When it comes to selecting players for a baseball team, gut instinct has been overvalued, leading to drafting decisions that are often prejudiced. Focusing on data as the base for most scouting decisions is a much sounder approach, even if exceptional circumstances might sometimes force scouting directors to ignore the data and follow their own instincts.

    "title": "Bad Pharma",
    "author": "Ben Goldacre",
    "summary": "It would be nice to believe that medicine trials live up to proper scientific practice. It would similarly be great if we could trust that the pills we put in our mouths were effective. But unfortunately, such reputable practices cannot be taken for granted. In these blinks you’ll discover how pharmaceutical companies harm medicine by conducting trials that make drugs look significantly better than they really are. Due to deliberate methodological flaws and the withholding of data, medicine has become as corrupt as any other profit-driven industry. You’ll also learn that pharmaceutical companies often fail to publish unflattering trial results; drug companies persuade doctors to prescribe their medicine; and real-life data can easily be analyzed for decades to come. So how do we know how effective drugs are? Often we look to medical trials to determine whether certain medicines are worth taking. Unfortunately, however, not all trials are created equally. Trials that are funded by pharmaceutical companies are more likely to produce results skewed in their favor. This bias becomes startlingly evident when you look at the results of Harvard and Toronto researchers’ 2010 survey of over five hundred medicinal trials. The survey asked two main questions: Did the results favor the test drug? Were they funded by the industry? Of the industry-funded studies, 85 percent yielded positive results, compared to only 50 percent of the government-funded trials. This sort of huge discrepancy indicates that studies sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry produce positive results that cater to industry interests. In addition, industry-funded trials are often riddled with hidden methodological flaws that make drugs appear better than they are.   Let’s take a look at the multinational pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer, for example, which published several trials on a drug called Pregabalin designed to treat pain. During these trials, researchers measured participants’ pain at regular intervals. However, as is often the case in medical trials, some participants exited the study because they were experiencing the drug’s negative side effects. In these cases, Pfizer decided to take the last measurement of pain severity – while participants were still on the drug – and simply carry that over into the remaining measurements. This technique is deceptive because it disregards the negative side effects. When the analysis was eventually redone – this time properly – Pfizer’s “last observation” method was unsurprisingly revealed to have overestimated the improvement in pain by about 25 percent. As we saw in the last blink, if medical trials are funded by the industry, it’s a safe bet that the results will be positive. But how exactly do industry-sponsored trials nearly always manage to achieve positive results? One way is to simply not publish medical trials that produce unflattering results. We can see this quite evidently in an investigation published in 2010, whereby researchers compiled the results of all the trials that had ever been conducted on the drug reboxetine, an antidepressant by Pfizer. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against a placebo, i.e., an inert sugar pill. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, yielded a positive result, and not coincidentally, it was this trial that was published in an academic journal. But what about the other six trials? They had almost ten times as many patients, and each of these trials showed reboxetine to be no better than a sugar pill. Yet, these trials were never published. This withholding of trial data fundamentally distorts medical evidence. By preventing you from seeing half of the relevant data, it becomes exceedingly easy to convince you of something false. This process of withholding negative trial results from publication is called publication bias, and it’s no small matter. In medicine, research serves a concrete purpose: to save lives, cure illness, and ease suffering. Withholding trial results puts people’s lives at risk. We like to think of scientific research as being objective and free from commercial bias. However, business and research are only becoming more intertwined, as an increasing number of medical trials are conducted by clinical research organizations (CROs) on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. Trials conducted by CROs bring down the cost of testing drugs, since CROs outsource to poorer countries, but this commercialization of research raises some ethical dilemmas. According to the Declaration of Helsinki, an important set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation, trial participants are supposed to come from a population that could reasonably benefit from their results. In practice, this means that a costly AIDS drug, for instance, shouldn’t be tested on people in the impoverished parts of the world, where the drug would be out of financial reach for participants. Yet, in many cases, especially in Africa, drugs are tested on people who couldn’t possibly benefit from the drugs’ development – simply because it’s cheaper. Moreover, the commercialization and globalization of research trials calls into question the data’s reputability. For example, if a high blood pressure drug is tested on a pool of typical patients in India, those patients would exhibit different underlying characteristics, lifestyle habits and medical access than if the same study was conducted in America or Europe, causing a significant rift in test results. Would the findings really be applicable to Western patients? In fact, medical trials from developing countries have produced positive results while those conducted elsewhere showed no benefit. If clinical research is conducted economically rather than ethically, we simply can’t be sure of the data. Medications don’t go straight from the lab to the stores. First, pharmaceutical companies have to send their drugs to regulators for approval. Regulators are tasked with monitoring a drug’s safety, but unfortunately, the regulatory environment is beset with problems. For starters, government regulators tend to be paid poorly. However, someone with such inside knowledge on regulation is valued by pharmaceutical companies. As a result, regulators are often tempted to leave the regulatory body in favor of the private sector. Even Europe’s top medicinal regulator at the time, Thomas Lonngren, announced in December 2010 that he was leaving his governmental post to work as a private consultant for the pharmaceutical industry. But people change jobs all the time. What’s the big deal? Well, what happens when governmental regulators, in the course of their everyday duties, are thinking about their future at a drug company? Could they not help a drug company overcome hurdles and approve a drug in order to leave a good impression?    This conflict of interest makes the existing regulatory mechanisms ineffective. In fact, the standards have been set so low that regulators only require pharmaceutical companies to show that their drug is better than nothing. When a new drug is released, doctors and patients are interested in one practical question: is it better than the best currently available option? However, the answer is often no. Of the 197 new drugs approved by the American Federal Drug Administration between 2000 and 2010, only 70 percent boasted data that suggested they were better than other available treatments. The same problem exists in the EU: to get a license to market your drug, you only have to show that it’s better than nothing. In fact, only half the drugs approved between 1995 and 2005 had been studied in comparison with other treatments at the time they were allowed on the market. Medical trials aren’t perfect. Sometimes they’re conducted in unrepresentative patients, or sometimes they’re too brief. They can measure the wrong data, be incorrectly analyzed and sometimes the results simply disappear entirely. On occasion, trial results are outright fraudulent. One famous case of medical research fraud comes from American anaesthetist Dr. Scott Reuben, who simply never conducted the twenty or more clinical trials on pain he had published over the previous decade. Instead, he made up the data!   Trials can also fail because they’re conducted on unrepresentative “ideal” patients. In the real world, patients are complicated: they have diverse medical problems and histories or take lots of different medicines, all of which interact with each other in unpredictable ways. Despite these complications, clinical trials sometimes study drugs in unrepresentative, unrealistically ideal patients, who are both young and also have a clear, singular diagnosis. Freed from real-life complications, trials in an ideal population might exaggerate the benefits of a treatment or find benefits where there are none, thus making the results completely irrelevant to real-world application. And yet, these kinds of trials are actually routine in pharmaceutical research. Finally, drugs are often tested against ineffective competitors. One thing that is sure to make a new treatment look promising is testing it against another that doesn’t work very well. For example, a study compared the drugs paroxetine and amitryptiline: paroxetine is a newer antidepressant, and is largely free from side effects such as drowsiness; amitryptiline, in contrast, is a very old drug, known to make people sleepy. In clinical practice, patients take it only at night to account for this side effect. In this trial, however, both medicines were administered in the morning. Amitryptline patients thus reported daytime drowsiness, which made paroxetine look better by comparison. With all the available medicines out there today, how do doctors decide which to prescribe? They don’t have the time to read every single peer-reviewed article relevant to their work. This presents a great opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry, which spends billions on marketing (about twice as much as it does on research and development) to convince doctors that their medicine is the real deal. One way to do this is to appeal to doctors directly. In fact, the overwhelming majority of the industry’s promotional budget goes to marketing directed at doctors. About half of that is spent on drug reps, people who visit doctors in their offices and try to convince them in person of the superiority of their company’s drugs over the competition. Drug reps are often young and attractive, bringing both gifts and the promise of a mutually beneficial relationship with the drug company they represent. Drug companies also print advertisements in academic journals. While ads for drugs are supposed to contain “objective” and “unambiguous” information, a study from 2010 found that less than half of the drug ads in leading medical journals referenced a high-quality trial which supported their claims. Drug companies also fund patient groups, who need money to lobby and support their members more effectively. These groups also can benefit from specialist expertise. Drug companies are happy to oblige, as this gives them an opportunity to establish a positive image for their brand, as direct advertising to patients is prohibited. Finally, drug companies pay celebrities to mention drugs during interviews. For example, Kathleen Turner, the mom from Serial Mom, drops references in interviews to arthritis drugs, and is paid to do so by Wyeth and Amgen.     Altogether, this forms a powerful marketing mechanism through which tens of billions of dollars are spent each year – as much as $60 billion in the US alone. By now you’ve seen what’s wrong with advertising and testing within the pharmaceutical industry. Our final blink looks at what we can do to change it. Because the pharmaceutical industry puts so little effort into running effective trials, we really have no idea which treatments are actually the best for many of the most important diseases. One way to counteract this problem is by establishing randomized trials in routine medical practice. Let’s say you wanted to compare two statins, drugs used to lower cholesterol in the blood, in order to see which is best at preventing heart attacks. Normally, when a general practitioner sees a patient and prescribes a statin, she simply clicks the “prescribe” button in her software that links to a page where she chooses the drug and prints out a prescription.    Here, an extra page could be added: “Wait! We don’t yet know which of these two statins is best. Rather than choosing one, just press here to randomly assign one or the other to your patient.” The doctor’s office would then need to follow up with the patient on the drug’s effectiveness. Using this type of system, the medical community could create a meaningful, anonymized database of health records, which, eventually, could give us a better idea of which medicines are actually best. Many of the major problems with clinical trials can be addressed with these kinds of simple trials and electronic health records: The key message in this book: The pharmaceutical industry puts little effort into developing effective drugs, and instead spends billions on marketing. If we want to live in a world in which we are prescribed medicine because it’s the best solution to our ailment, then we’ll have to seriously rework the way medical trials work.

    "title": "Beautiful Game Theory",
    "author": "Ignacio Palacios-Huerta",
    "summary": "When a soccer player lines up for the penalty kick, how likely is it that he’ll score? Does it depend on the player? Or the goalkeeper? Or something else entirely? As you’ll find out, the answer to those questions is quite intriguing, and has to do with far more than the skill of the players. What’s more, these questions aren’t just interesting for fanatical soccer fans – they are also highly relevant to the field of economics. These blinks will offer you insight into the economic thinking that plays out on the soccer field and how abstract economic theories can be verified by the most popular game ever. By examining soccer data, you’ll learn about new economic models of human behavior and get a completely new view on the importance of soccer matches. In addition, you’ll learn why you should always choose to kick first during a penalty shoot-out; why the referee always seems to prefer the home team; and how to get the most out of your Rock Paper Scissors strategy. To appreciate how soccer helps us understand economics, we first have to understand John Neumann’s minimax theorem. His game theory theorem concerns two-player zero-sum games, games in which the positive payoff for one player always means negative payoff for the other. Minimax assumes that players choose strategies that aim to minimize their opponents’ maximum possible payoff – hence “minimax.” And since we’re talking about zero-sum games, this also means that each player also attempts to minimize his own maximum loss. For example, in a game of Rock Paper Scissors, only one player can win, and the other will lose. Each player’s strategy is therefore to minimize the payoff (the win) for the other. There are two such strategies: pure and mixed. Pure strategies are strategies whereby a player always chooses the same move (like playing Rock every time), whereas mixed strategies employ variations of Rock, Paper and Scissors. An important hypothesis of minimax theory is that if it’s disadvantageous for the other player to know your choice in advance, then you will benefit from choosing random strategies. For example, imagine that you are playing Rock Paper Scissors against a long-time friend. If you tend to play Paper most often, then your friend can easily exploit this by pursuing a pure strategy – that is, by always playing Scissors. However, if one person plays pure and the other plays mixed, the mixed strategy will win two-thirds of the time. On the other hand, if both players play mixed strategies, then both will have equal chances to win. Thus, if two players randomly play Rock, Paper or Scissors, they should each win 50 percent of the games. Ideally, then, both players should mix moves, because every pure strategy would only have a 33 percent chance of winning. The minimax theorem was introduced as far back as 1928, but had never been verified by empirical data. That is, until the penalty kick in soccer. But why are penalty kicks considered a minimax game? Just like Rock Paper Scissors, there are only a limited number of strategies, which are chosen independently of the opposition’s choice. The game involves a kicker and a goalie, who both have a strategy (kick left, right, or middle; jump left, right, or stay in the middle). The payoff for the kicker is the goal; the payoff for the goalie is a no-goal. The kicker tries to maximize the likelihood of scoring, while the goalie tries to minimize the likelihood. Importantly, since it takes the ball only 0.3 seconds to reach the goal, the goalie can’t react to the kicker’s strategy. Instead, he has to decide on a strategy beforehand, meaning that both players choose their strategies independently of one another. Additionally, because each player must choose from a limited number of strategies – left, right, and middle – we can therefore formalize the players’ choices, and evaluate whether they verify predictions made by the minimax theorem. Indeed, the kickers’ strategies prove the minimax theorem’s predictions about both players’ behavior and the effectiveness of their strategies, namely that they choose mixed strategies, that the likelihood of success is the same for mixed strategies and that no soccer player employs pure strategies. Interestingly, a player’s kicking strategy shows that players automatically create serially independent sequences, meaning that they neither always kick towards the same corner nor always change corners.  In other words, their shot location is random.   Just as minimax predicts, this strongly indicates that their choice in strategies is not influenced by previous choices or outcomes. In fact, of the circa 9,000 penalty kicks in international leagues that have been evaluated, the average scoring probability across strategies is 80 percent, regardless of the order in which the kicker shot left, right or center. As you’ll see in our following blinks, just as soccer can help to verify game theory, it can also help us clarify assumptions about other economic models that were previously considered too vague to evaluate. Not only does the penalty shoot-out shed light on game theory; it also provides us with a unique opportunity to analyze the psychological factors in competitive behavior. Economists and psychologists look at the environment in which decisions take place in order to better understand those decisions. A penalty kick, for example, falls under the category of “tournament settings,” characterized by competition. Social scientists use these models to analyze other real-life competitive situations, like job promotions, and study what factors influence who wins. However, economists and psychologists have found tournaments to be insufficient as analogies for real-life competition, as it's hard to observe and measure the strategies behind real-life scenarios. For example, did a candidate manage to earn a promotion because he had a higher incentive (like paying off his mortgage) or because he was more likeable or less stressed during the interview? The tournament model simply can’t provide a satisfactory answer. This insufficiency is due primarily to the lack of clarity in the observation of strategies and outcomes in everyday situations. The results are already difficult to categorize, and seem too vague to use in explaining psychology or emotions. The penalty kick, however, offers the ideal way of evaluating psychological influence in tournament settings because of how simple all of the variables are; it reduces the entire scenario to only the outcomes (the result of the shot) and the psychological factors, such as shooting first or second. Moreover, the randomness of the kicking order in a penalty shoot-out makes for reliable data. In a penalty shoot-out, both teams are automatically part of a random selection process: the coin flip. Thus, the decision as to who goes first – and 97 percent of all professional players chose to kick first – is randomized. This randomness adds credibility to penalty-kick data, as randomized data can’t be easily tampered with. Because both teams perform in front of the same audience and because the result of the penalty shoot-out determines who wins the match (i.e., they have the same stakes), we can ask: does kicking order in a shoot-out effect athletes’ performance? The result is astonishing: Consider that between 1970 and 2014, the winning frequencies by team in both national and international competitions were 60.6 percent for the first team and 39.4 percent for the second. This is because the standard order of ABABABABAB, where A is one team and B is the other, puts tremendous pressure on the kicker of the second team. In fact, kickers seem to know this: there are only two exceptions in all documented coin tosses in which the winner of the toss didn’t choose to go first. The first exception was Italian goalie Buffon against Casillas, a goalie from Spain. Buffon won the coin toss and decided that Spain should kick first. Five years later, the same teams and the same players went to a shoot-out, and the Spanish goalie chose Italy as the first kicker. But how do we know that the disadvantage of the order ABABABABAB is purely psychological? Well, studies have shown that if we change the kicking order to something else, like ABBABAAB, we can eliminate the disadvantage almost entirely. In order to test this, scientists had professionals from Spain’s La Liga perform 200 shoot-outs in the new order, and found that the new order had evened out winning frequency: 51 percent for the first and 49 percent for the second team. The sequence ABBABAAB is called Prouhet-Thue-Morse (PTM) sequence, and answers one important question in studying tournament settings: how can you order a sequential competition between two players such that it is as fair as possible? The order used today, Strict Alternation (ABAB) gives an advantage to one competitor – one that is completely psychological. Clearly, psychological factors influence players’ performance. Our next blink will explore how pressure can influence the other people on the field: referees. One of the fundamental tasks in economics is to analyze how people make decisions. The soccer field provides a perfect environment to study how social pressure affects our decision-making. For one, audience support of the home team applies social pressure to the referee. Because professional games are attended by up to 100,000 people, this pressure can be overwhelming and can lead to bias. Consider this recent evaluation of data from Spanish soccer matches, which has even revealed that, when the rewards are higher for winning the game (for instance, at tournament finals), the referee’s bias towards the home team increases equally. This indicates that the stakes for the home team has influence on the referee as well. The statistical mean of injury time is 2.93 minutes in the second half of the game, and this rarely changes if a team leads by more than 1 point or if it’s tied. However, injury time varies greatly if it is a close contest. For example, if the home team is ahead by 1 goal, then the extra time added at the end of a half in order to make up for time lost due to injuries or other interruptions is 29 percent below average – either 1 or 2 minutes. When the home team is behind by 1 goal, injury time is 35 percent above average – somewhere around 4 extra minutes! So, when the game is close enough for injury time to matter, that is, if the difference in score is greater than 1 point, then the referee systematically favors the home team, meaning that social pressure can unconsciously influence people whose only job is to remain neutral. However, there are ways to influence the game without actually being on the field, such as cheering, whistling, booing and hooliganism. In our final blinks, you’ll learn how these influences affect other fans. In spite of fear’s drastic effects on our behavior, it has only very recently been investigated in economic theory. How does risk change the behavior of consumers? And how do they manage this fear? Fear is the result of the difference between subjective and objective probabilities of risk – people respond to subjective fear of a situation, not the objective risk. First put into an economic model by Becker and Rubinstein in 2013, it put forward two testable hypotheses: First, that with the right incentives (benefits), people learn to control their fear (costs). The idea is that your willingness to control your fear is dependent on what economic cost/benefit you expect from exerting that control. Therefore, if we can determine how much potential benefit they expect to receive, we can then measure and predict people’s reactions to frightening situations. Interestingly, when someone expects large benefits from controlling one’s emotions (e.g., fear), his or her subjective experience will more closely reflect the objective risk. Consider, for example, that people who frequently travel on airplanes benefit greatly from controlling their fear that they could crash and die. Their subjective belief of how likely it is that they will crash is closer to the objective, statistical risk of crashing. However, those who very rarely travel by plane often show anxiety or fear – their subjective belief of the likelihood that they will crash is larger than the actual risk. Indeed, if you frequently find yourself in a given situation then you are less likely to avoid that situation because of its risk. For example, data gathered from the Palestinian Intifada between 2000 and 2005 showed that the Palestinian attacks in Israel only influenced the Israelis who occasionally used the goods and services that exposed them to risk, such as restaurants, shopping malls, cafés. In contrast, the demand of frequent users was completely unchanged by terrorist attacks. Interestingly, the Becker-Rubinstein model can be verified by soccer data by looking at how violence and hooliganism affect ticket sales. The following data is from 45 seasons in the Spanish League, from 1951-1995. One hundred and sixty seven events were recorded that qualified as hooliganism and 334 matches were singled out in a before/after analysis. Married people, for example, show the strongest reaction to acts of violence and hooliganism, due to their higher costs of overcoming fear. Indeed, studies found a 40 percent difference in the ticket renewal rate between singles and married individuals after one particularly violent soccer season. In fact, only 51 percent of married people actually renewed their tickets. Why? Their emotional investment in their marriage outweighed their interest in their hobbies. The opposite was true for singles, who had no marriage in which to be emotionally invested. Likewise, single-ticket buyers’ attendance dropped by 40 percent after acts of violence. Single-ticket buyers attend games only occasionally, and therefore don’t benefit from overcoming their fear of violence at soccer games. By contrast, single season-ticket holders, are hardly affected by violence. In fact, almost all of them, 94 percent, renewed their season tickets after acts of violences, and 95 percent attended games directly following acts of hooliganism. All of this data confirms the prediction of the Becker-Rubinstein model that controlling our fears depends on our incentive to do so. But the second hypothesis of the Becker-Rubinstein model did not prove true: that better educated people are able to more accurately assess objective risk. If we split season-ticket holders that fall into the categories of high education (5-6 year college degree) and low education (high school degree), we see that the attendance rate among the high education group dropped only from 95 to 93 percent after acts of violence. The attendance of the low education group, however, dropped much more significantly – from 92 to 75 percent. This data of soccer attendance shows us that maybe more highly educated people are not in fact better at assessing objective risk. However, because of other variables that the study does not take into consideration, this example exposes some shortcomings in attempting to link data to causation. The key message in this book: We can gain a number of insights into economic behavior by looking to the soccer field. By examining the strategies of the penalty kick, a referee’s preference to a particular team, and even something as simple as ticket sales, we can learn a lot about the world around us. Suggested further reading: Risk Savvy by Gerd Gigerenzer Risk Savvy is an exploration into the way we misunderstand risk and uncertainty, often at great expense to our health, finances and relationships. However, if we better understand risk, we can develop the tools necessary to navigate this highly complex world without having to become an “expert in everything.”",

    "summary": "Have you ever found yourself asking, “why did I just do that?” Have you ever been shocked by your own callousness or by an inappropriate or vulgar thought running through your mind? Well, human behavior is influenced by several different factors, some neurological and some environmental. Some of these influences have developed over thousands of years of human history and civilization; others are chemical processes in the brain that take place milliseconds before a given behavioral act occurs. It turns out that behavior is indeed unique to the individual, but also very much dependent on the societies and cultures that make up the modern world. In these blinks, we will explore some of the intricate factors that play a part in determining our all-too-human behavior. You’ll also learn why the liberal mind-set is actually just brain chemistry; about the relationship between wheat and patent applications; and which part of the brain is racist. The saying goes that everything happens for a reason, and whether or not you believe this to be the case when it comes to the events that unfold in a lifetime, it’s certainly a valid statement when it comes to grasping human behavior. If we really want to get to grips with the factors that influence humanity's best and worst behaviors, we're going to have to delve deeply into human biology. Immediately before a given behavior occurs – such as the shooting of a gun – the oldest parts of the human brain kick into gear. We inherited these regions of the brain from our evolutionary ancestors, and these very regions are the ones that process our most basic instincts, like the fear of death. This is just the sort of emotional impulse that might lead a person to pull a trigger. But, in the seconds to minutes before the fatal moment occurs, the brain has been busy processing sensory data – particularly visual or auditory information – based on its immediate environment. This information from the senses impacts on how we act. In a war zone, for example, heightened sensory awareness of danger makes it much more likely that we'll act aggressively. However, the brain’s response isn’t randomly generated. In fact, our behavioral biology is deeply intertwined with human society, culture and history. Years to decades before a behavior takes place, we’ll have grown up in human societies that determine our behavior. Different societies will condition us to behave in different ways; in other words, we are more prone to violence if we were exposed and accustomed to constant violence earlier in our lives. And if we go back hundreds to thousands of years, we’d find ancestral geographies and ecologies have affected human behavior, for better and for worse. In short, if we’re going to get to the crux of the matter, we’re going to have to take an interdisciplinary approach to explain the complex origins of human behavior. Right before an aggressive behavior takes place, the brain must make several split-second decisions. Two specific parts of the brain are critical in this process: the amygdala and the frontal cortex. The amygdala is located in the largest part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, and is the region associated with aggressive behavior and fear. We know this because brain scans show activity in the amygdala when people are shown images that stimulate anger or fear. There’s also an historical case that suggests just such a link. In 1966, an autopsy was carried out on Charles Whitman, who had murdered his wife and mother before carrying out a mass shooting at the University of Texas. Whitman's motive was unclear. He’d even left a note next to his wife's body stating he could not “rationally pinpoint any specific reason” for the act. However, his autopsy found a tumor pressing against his amygdala. In fact, the previously happily married man had told his doctor of headaches and violent impulses prior to the murders, and it's believed that the pressure against his amygdala caused neurological changes that led to his sudden, violent behavior. The frontal cortex, meanwhile, is responsible for regulating emotions, including aggression, and also controls impulsiveness. This is demonstrated by the fascinating case of Phineas Gage. In 1848, while working on a railroad construction site, an iron rod punctured his skull and destroyed his frontal cortex. Amazingly, he survived – but was a completely changed man. He now began to swear, was impatient and was subject to pronounced mood swings. It was later discovered that this was because the frontal cortex is critical in determining what constitutes appropriate behavior and in restraining aggression. Beyond this one case, there’s evidence that large numbers of violent criminals have experienced concussions involving the frontal cortex, and that violent psychopaths generally have less activity in this particular brain region. Whether it’s the sight of a flashing blade or a light touch on your hand, the five senses are constantly sending information to the brain. These signals are known as sensory cues. It turns out that visual cues, such as people’s faces, alter our perception of strangers and our attitudes toward them. Critically, it’s been proven that our brains are extremely attuned to skin color. When images of faces are flashed before the eyes of white participants for one-tenth of a second, the amygdala is more likely to activate if the face comes from a different ethnic background. Of course, when the face is shown for longer, the frontal cortex’s response will rationalize that initial response from the amygdala. The fearful response will be quelled – for nonracists, at least. But there are nevertheless practical implications to this initial tendency. Shamefully, it has been proven that longer sentences are awarded for the same crime if the defendant has a more stereotypically “African” face, which has led to interesting strategies by defense attorneys. These include giving their black male clients clunky glasses to wear, as they are more closely associated with white nerds than black criminals. Such a small detail might just be enough to sway a jury. Equally, auditory cues can unconsciously generate fear. In a similar face-flashing experiment, music was played. Rap music, due to its association with African-American culture, was found to cause increased amygdala activity. Conversely, white-associated death metal music had the opposite effect. Knowledge of this fact actually led a black postgraduate student who studied with the author's colleague to whistle pieces by Vivaldi when walking home at night, as he didn't want to appear threatening. On top of these two types of cues, our behavior toward others is also based on our immediate social context. It’s an observable fact that when men are around women, they're more likely to take risks, as well as buy luxury items rather than spend more on everyday essentials. This male “generosity” could well be seen as the male brain unconsciously giving off mating signals. It’s well known that hormones are chemical messengers that affect different parts of the brain; they form in various glands and are released into the bloodstream. Just think of testosterone, which forms in the male testes or female ovaries. But the relationship between hormones and behavior isn’t as simple as you might think. Testosterone, contrary to common understanding, does not directly cause aggression, even though studies have shown a clear correlation. For instance, it's well known that castration does lead to a decline in a man’s levels of aggression. Some people might then be tempted to ask: would sex offenders be less likely to re-offend if castrated? But such questions miss the point, because context is a key factor. Studies have shown that male prisoners measure higher testosterone levels if they display more aggressive behavior. It's tempting to imagine that the testosterone is at fault, but it’s actually the aggressive behavior that causes the increased testosterone secretion. Nevertheless, since the amygdala is full of testosterone receptors, more testosterone increases aggressive behavior. But it only does so if the individual was already predisposed toward such behavior. The hormone oxytocin is also interesting, as it's associated with positive feelings, such as trust. While testosterone increases amygdala activity, oxytocin inhibits it. Therefore, oxytocin levels correlate with prosocial behavior. This has been observed in studies involving economic games. Increased oxytocin levels in subjects led them to perceive others as more trustworthy. Normally, with low oxytocin, you would expect subjects to distrust deceitful players more as the game progresses. However, when oxytocin was high, subjects still trusted other players regardless of their deceit. Increased oxytocin levels in subjects led them to perceive others as more trustworthy. But, just as with testosterone, context is critical. The subjects playing the economic game only had boosted levels of trust if the other players were in the same room. Trust did not increase if their fellow players were anonymous and in another room. As the brain matures, behavior also changes. Interestingly, even though the brain is 85 percent fully developed in the first two years of life, it's the remaining 15 percent that is essential for determining behavioral development. Believe it or not, the frontal cortex doesn’t finish developing until we're in our mid-20s. In fact, adolescence is a critical time for brain development. During this time, the immature frontal cortex can negatively influence behavioral traits such as risk-taking or impulsiveness. Unfortunately, this lack of self-regulation can cause late adolescents and young adults to experience a spike in violent behavior. Recognition of these biological circumstances means that in some countries, like the United States, the criminal justice system treats young offenders more leniently. There, the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark case that it was illegal to sentence juvenile criminals to life without parole. Aside from the impact of an immature frontal cortex during this formative period, it’s been shown that difficulties in childhood can cause lifelong increases in violence. During childhood, the human brain has remarkable neural plasticity, which means that a child’s brain can absorb information much faster than an adult’s. However, this can also result in problems later in life if a child has had repeated negative experiences. Studies show that 33 percent of adults who experienced childhood abuse will themselves abuse their children. So, if we experience adversity such as poverty or violence as children, this can, in turn, lead to simultaneous neurological overdevelopment and underdevelopment – a very destructive one-two punch. This happens because adversity results in excessive growth in the amygdala and underdevelopment in the frontal cortex. And the result is clear. As we’ve seen, the frontal cortex inhibits the amygdala from making impulsive decisions. So, when the former is underdeveloped and the latter overdeveloped – as is the case with individuals who experience childhood adversity – the outcome is poorer behavioral regulation, as well as a tendency toward violence later in life. We’ve seen so far that grasping the physiology of the brain is essential if we want to understand the roots of human behavior. But there’s more going on than neurobiology. After all, if murder is 450 times more likely in Honduras than in Singapore, inevitably, the experience of growing up in one country or the other will have a profound impact on your behavior. In other words, some behavioral differences are culturally conditioned. Let’s consider the differences between an individualist culture, like the United States, and more collectivist cultures, such as those in East Asia. Individualist cultures are based on individual rights and personal achievement; conversely, collectivist cultures place the needs of the group above those of the individual. This plays out in differences in brain activation. Frontal cortices are more likely to activate in Americans when they look at pictures of themselves than when they see those of relatives. East Asians, meanwhile, do not display this impulse nearly as much. Additionally, such cultural differences affect sensory processing. If shown an image of a person standing alone in the center of a complex scene, Westerners are more likely to remember the details of the person, while East Asians are better at remembering the scene. Most obviously, of course, differences in culture result in varying moral systems. Collectivist cultures tend to place greater value on the needs of the many, which means that more utilitarian moral stances are common. In enacting something like criminal justice, it can be clearly seen that the greater good is held in high esteem. For instance, collectivist cultures are more willing to imprison innocent persons if it means a riot can be stopped that way. On the other hand, in cultures like that of the United States, individual rights are more highly valued, and it would be an affront to societal norms if individuals were imprisoned without due process. Collectivist and individualist cultures across the globe didn’t develop by chance; rather, each is dependent on its environment and situation. That is to say, it’s not just cultural background that informs behavior. The ecological and geographical background to this cultural development is also critical, and it’s a centuries-long process. Let’s look at how ecology shapes cultural differences in behavior first. Some East Asian civilizational development depended extensively on rice cultivation, a communal activity requiring collective labor. In Northern China, by comparison, it’s harder to grow rice. There, wheat is grown, which is a much more individual form of agriculture. As it turns out, divorce is more common in these wheat-growing regions than in neighboring rice-growing regions, and this more individualistic approach to life also means more patents are filed in the north, too. Similarly, geographical circumstances can explain the United States’ propensity toward individualism. The United States is a country based largely on immigration. Broadly speaking, people who immigrated to the United States often did so because they were seen as outcasts, second-class citizens or even criminals in their native cultures. America represented a fresh start, not only because it offered a path out of their original social context, but a new geographic environment as well. Additionally, it’s important to consider colonial American geographical development. The rapidly growing country had a constantly moving frontier, and it needed immigrants to develop, farm and \"civilize\" the land. This development cultivated a real sense of individualism, self-reliance and even aggression, and these are common character traits that can still be observed across many of the United States’ southern states to this day. Historically, the region has been pastoral and rural in its geography, which often meant the central government couldn’t properly implement the rule of law. As a result, people became accustomed to taking justice into their own hands. Sadly, this has also led to increased levels of violence in the region, which are still in evidence to this day. It’s no great shock to learn that the brain plays a part in determining political views and morals. But the way it does so will surprise you. In fact, there’s a correlation between neurobiological conditions and whether someone has a liberal or conservative worldview. One study interviewed people from both sides of the political spectrum. They were asked what they thought about the roots of poverty, and both groups initially proposed similar reasons: poor people were at fault because of their laziness. However, if given time to rationalize, liberals tended toward a situational explanation. They felt that the system is stacked against the poor. The author suggests that a similar mentality is also present when non-political topics are under examination. Imagine someone falling over while dancing. Initially, both liberals and conservatives would hold the dancer responsible for his clumsiness. However, over time, liberals would recognize that the difficulty of the dance step was probably also to blame. More tellingly still, there are observable neurobiological differences between the two groups. Liberals have increased levels of gray matter in their cingulate cortex, the area of the brain associated with empathy. Conversely, conservatives have an increased perception of fear, most likely because they tend to have enlarged amygdalae. Consequently, conservatives are also more anxious in risky situations. On top of this, neurobiological connections in the brain also inform morality. If you decide to tell a lie against your better judgment, the frontal cortex will activate. The frontal cortex has to work at full thrust to stop you from being tempted to tell the truth. This happens because simply telling the truth is easier for the brain than strategic deceit. Conversely, the frontal cortices of very honest individuals do not activate even when they’re given the opportunity to deceive. After all, if deception isn’t something they’d consider doing in the first place, then there’s no requirement for the frontal cortex to restrain the impulse. If you witness a needle being pushed into someone’s finger, your response will be physical. You might even find your own hand closing up tightly as an empathetic response. This type of reaction is telling because it shows that empathy is actually closely connected with avoiding pain. When you perceive others’ pain, the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is activated. It’s a region of the brain that’s linked to both the frontal cortex and the amygdala. The ACC is responsible for helping us learn to fear observable bad experiences. These neurological connections indicate that empathy actually has more to do with self-preservation than with a desire to help others. Levels of empathy are also contingent on sensory factors. Even the visual perception of someone's “race” can affect empathy. Remember that person being pricked by a needle? As we know from earlier blinks, if you see a person of a different ethnic background, your fear-inducing amygdala is more likely to activate, making you less likely to empathize with him as a result. This, again, has real-world consequences. We now know from an interesting study that if you want to be compassionate, it’s best that you don’t actually try to empathize. In the study, two parallel training sessions for volunteers took place. One session was focused on empathy, and the other on compassion. In the former, volunteers were asked to feel the pain of a distressed subject. The resulting amygdala activation led to anxiety and negative feelings. In the latter, they were asked to feel warmth toward the distressed subject, and were explicitly told to avoid empathizing. This time, the amygdala didn’t activate, but the frontal cortex did, making the volunteers exhibit positive and prosocial emotions. This shows that although we might tend to associate empathy and compassion with each other, they are in fact articulations of two different parts of the brain, each activated by different reactions to seeing others in pain. There's no escaping it: we might like to think that human behavior is easily predicted, but it is a highly complex and multifaceted field. From societal and historical conditioning, right through to the smallest neurological activations, the reasons behind human behavior are manifold and varied. The key message in this book: Human behavior is linked to both brain chemistry and the society in which we live. Whether it’s behaving aggressively or feeling empathy toward others, different parts of the brain are activated when we carry out these behavioral acts. Only by understanding how these behaviors come about can we truly understand what it means to exist and function in a society. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "summary": "Humans have always lived side by side with animals. We have feared them, worshipped them, domesticated them, even brought them into our homes as pets. But how much do we really know about what they feel and think? And can they think and feel in the first place? Answering this question is harder than it might seem. First, we must learn to see animals as unique creatures, with different needs, minds and feelings than us, and then start viewing them on their own terms. Only then can we truly get to know them. Interestingly, there’s a lot of research that shows that they can think, feel and communicate in complex ways. You’ll never see animals the same way again. In these blinks, you’ll learn how wolves became dogs; how to get sex if you’re a chimpanzee; and how killer whales communicate. We all know the term “puppy dog eyes” and most of us have felt a surge of emotion at the sight of a pooch wearing this seemingly sad expression. But can dogs really feel emotion? Actually, anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism are huge roadblocks to seeing animals as they truly are. That’s because scientists are trained to observe and aren’t meant to attribute human characteristics to other beings, or in other words to anthropomorphize them. A scientist could say that an elephant stood between her child and a hyena, but would shy away from saying she did so to protect the infant. After all, there could be another reason. And anthropocentrism? That’s the idea that humans are uniquely capable of feeling and thinking. This is major, because if other animals can’t feel or think like us, then why should they have any rights? So, a better way to view animals is by acknowledging that they have minds, albeit minds of their own. For example, thanks to their superb hearing, an elephant will notice an approaching truck or a herd of animals long before a human does. As a result, they might move way before their handler even spots something coming. Failing to acknowledge this fact makes it easy to misinterpret elephant behavior. Therefore it’s key to acknowledge the differences between humans and animals but also those between all creatures on an individual basis. That’s because every human is the same but different – and that’s also true for all other species. For instance, humans have a long common history with other animals and therefore share common roots, but we have also diverged from them in a variety of ways. Nonetheless, we still share goals like those of survival, reproduction and finding food as well as shelter. Given all of these commonalities, the idea that animals can’t think or feel is totally absurd. But how can we prove that they can? If someone asked you to design an experiment to determine what thoughts were running through an animal’s head, what would you do? Well, one popular theory for testing the animal capacity for thought is called the theory of mind, or the ability to determine what others are likely thinking, and then to respond accordingly. Here’s how it developed. In 1978, researchers showed a group of chimpanzees films of humans getting cold or failing to reach a banana. The chimps were then given a choice between different pictures that fit the problem. For instance, a picture of a heater to warm up or a picture of a stick to reach a banana. The chimps failed to select the correct image, ostensibly proving that they lacked a theory of mind. But evidence of chimp behavior in the wild contradicts this. That’s because, in natural conditions, where only the alpha male has sex with the females, chimpanzees lower in the ranks will sometimes challenge the leader’s dominance. They do this knowing that it will prompt the alpha male to cause a scene, creating a diversion during which the lower ranking male can copulate with a female behind the alpha’s back. So, this tells us that chimps know how the alpha male thinks and how he’ll respond to their actions. But it doesn’t tell us much about what the chimpanzees are thinking. In fact, other experiments and explanations have also failed on that front. For instance, self-awareness can be tested by placing a dye mark on an animal’s forehead and having it look in a mirror. If the animal recognizes itself and attempts to remove the mark, it is thought to be self-aware. However, this test only proves an understanding of reflection – that the mirror image is not in fact you. It doesn’t prove anything about self-awareness. Even looking at an animal’s brain is unhelpful. For example, although an albatross's brain is extremely similar to a human's, its intelligence is nothing like ours. The bird simply needs different skills, like knowing how to find its way through several hundred miles of stormy weather. As you might know, the domesticated dogs of today are descended from wolves. But you likely don’t know how this process of transformation occurred. Actually, dogs domesticated themselves – here’s how. Surprisingly enough, it wasn’t the selective breeding of humans that domesticated dogs, but the adaptation of the animals themselves to the human settlements that provided them with food. This made it advantageous for wild dogs to be friendly to humans, as the friendly wolves got more food, bred more and eventually became what we know as dogs. But while they gained safety and food, they lost independence. For example, if a dog is presented with a locked box, it will look for human help, while a wolf will attempt to open it. And that’s not all that changed about the animal; this process even transformed their appearance. Experiments on foxes in Siberia have found a genetic link between friendliness and floppy ears and curled tails. The friendly foxes were those most selected by humans, and they therefore had more offspring, making floppy ears and curly tails more common. But selective breeding can also occur with zero human intervention. For instance, as we learned earlier, among chimpanzees, the dominant male holds a monopoly on reproduction. He therefore aggressively protects his position. However, the close relatives of the chimp, the bonobos, are a different story. Among this species the females rule and it is the friendly males, not the aggressive ones, which are preferred for breeding. As a result, the species has become friendlier over time. This is essentially an example of developing a characteristic temperament by selective breeding. So, while domestication is not well understood with regards to animal intelligence, what we do know about it helps explain the human limitations to understanding animal thoughts and feelings. Just think of how some people assume dogs are stupid because they are loyal even when abused. But this isn’t a matter of poor intelligence; the dog simply knows that being loyal to the one that feeds it will help it survive. Did you know that the basic structure of your brain is very similar to that of other mammals? This surprising fact says a lot about animal thought because having brains and hormones comparable to those of humans makes other mammals act, feel and think much like we do. In fact, animals actually demonstrate cognition, the ability to perceive and acquire knowledge. For example, elephants consciously learn which plants to eat from older elephants by observing them and tasting the foods they eat. So, while our experience of the world might differ from theirs, we certainly don’t have a monopoly on consciousness. However, science has long argued that animals can’t be conscious because their cerebral cortex is simply too small. Yet there are humans like Roger, a 30-year-old who lost 95 percent of his cerebral cortex to an infection, yet still knows who he is. And brains can even teach us about how animals feel. For instance, the hormone oxytocin is essential to bonding in humans as well as most other mammals. So, if it’s blocked in an individual’s brain, they’re likely to be more solitary. The fact that the same is true for humans and animals suggests a similarity both in our brains and our feelings. But what about the animals with tiny brains? Can they feel too? Actually, brain size is a poor indicator of animal intelligence. A better one is how similar an animal’s brain is to ours. That’s because a larger brain, while it means more computing power, isn’t necessarily helpful. For example, tuna have smaller brains than dolphins but are just as good at hunting. Large brains are necessary for being social and cooperating with others. That’s because when individuals are responsible for the survival of a group, a bigger or social brain is needed. Just think of the tactics employed by chimps to assert dominance. In the case of animals that do have social brains, like primates, elephants, whales and dolphins, it’s hard to deny that they’re thinking and feeling like humans when their brains so closely resemble ours. If you’ve ever observed elephants you know that they organize by group, a clear indication of their complex society. In fact, elephants even understand intra-group relationships, like which baby belongs to whom. This is called “understanding third-party relationships” and it’s key to functioning as a group. Not just that, but they’re a species led by a matriarch who holds the knowledge and history of the group. When she dies, another female will take her place, the group will divide or merge with another. Furthermore, as it’s essential for elephant families to remember where watering holes and food sources are located, they require adaptable brains, capable of learning. So, when elephants are born, their brains are only 35 percent as heavy as an adult elephant’s brain, giving them plenty of room to develop. Compare that to 90-percent brain weight at birth in most other mammals! Elephants are also cooperative and when lost will seek out others. In fact, they can even feel the emotions of another elephant. For instance, when an elephant is hurt, another will feed it, showing that they understand such situations and respond with compassion. Just as in humans, this behavior releases oxytocin in the elephant’s brain, rewarding them for helping others. But how did this organized elephant society develop? It’s all due to their long process of rearing offspring. Male elephants over 30 experience musth, an annual period of increased reproductive hormones that makes them aggressive and competitive for months at a time. On the other hand, although females come into heat from age 11 onward, it’s only for four days at a time. If impregnated, they’ll carry a child for two years after conception and nurse it for another two. That means each female elephant is only ready to mate on four days every four years, easily explaining the competition among males! So, making a baby elephant is hard work and those babies need to be protected. Since testosterone-charged adult males disrupt the peace of the group, young males remain subordinate in matriarchal families and leave them when they are grown. Can you imagine someone hunting you down with a gun? Most of us would be terrified. So it's no surprise that that's how animals respond, too. Orcas, a species that have been systematically hunted – even with machine guns – dramatically decreased in number in the twentieth century. These so-called “killer whales” hunted the same fish that fishermen prized and were therefore seen as competition. On top of that, their young were captured to stock aquariums. As a result, killer whales began avoiding certain locations and routes. But while North America largely banned their killing or capture in the 1970s, they continue to be hunted in Greenland and Indonesia to this day. Elephants also have to deal with human predators. Ivory poachers have drastically reduced the African elephant population, which used to cover the entire continent. The ivory trade was banned in 1990, but animal habitats and food supplies have still declined. In Kenya, the human population has quadrupled over the last 40 years while the elephant population declined by four-fifths. This change has caused the elephants to adopt unique responses to people. For instance, elephants are terrified of the spear-wielding Maasai, a semi-nomadic ethnic group of Kenya and Tanzania, because these tribespeople have often hurt elephants when trying to protect their own cattle. So, when elephants living close to the Maasai were presented with three different T-shirts, one belonging to a Maasai, another to a different local and one to a researcher, they only reacted with fear to the Maasai shirt, literally smelling the danger. The same goes for voices: the animals were relaxed in the presence of English-speakers, but responded with fear to the voice of a Maasai, meaning they know not all humans are the same. Nonetheless, neither elephants nor killer whales commonly show hatred for people. In fact, elephants are generally friendly to humans and the only instances of killer whales harming a person occurred in captivity. Orcas have even been reported to aid humans in need, protecting them from other predators. So, elephants’ brains are comparable to those of humans and they therefore have similar intelligence. But what about other animals? Well, it used to be thought that a pack of wolves was led by an alpha male. However, every member of the pack is crucial, from the alpha female he’s breeding with to their pups. That’s because the alphas need their offspring to hunt and need a partner to rear those pups. This is especially important as wolves are one of the few animals that hunt prey larger than themselves, like elk, a task that demands cooperation and teamwork. Every member of the pack is necessary, as some run faster while others are heavier and more capable of bringing down prey. Not to mention that this process must happen in a flash, before the dangerous antlers of an elk can do any damage. So, the alpha pair need to be confident leaders who enable the team. Leaders who are too aggressive often lead to a lack of cooperation among pack members. Not just that, but such alphas are in danger of being overthrown by other wolves in the pack. For instance, when a fight breaks out every wolf takes a side and the alphas risk losing their position if they’ve been too aggressive with the others. Alright, now you know wolves are organized, but did you know that they can also be generous? For example, a group of wolves was reintroduced to Yellowstone national park in 1995 to restore the natural balance of elk. The best killer among them was a wolf named “Twenty-One” and in all his time hunting in the park he never once killed a rival wolf. He would even let cubs beat him, demonstrating an awareness of how his actions would be perceived by others. He would always prove stronger in fights and, as the loser would naturally decline in status, Twenty-One’s territory and status were secure. Therefore he had easy access to mating and food and had no reason to kill his rivals. We all know that every person is different and the same is true for animals. However, personality in animals goes largely unacknowledged and it’s an area of study that requires more focus. For instance, “Oh-Six,” the granddaughter of Twenty-One, was an even more capable hunter. She could bring down two elk all by herself, a feat unheard of until that point. Naturally, her pack flourished. But during a hard winter, Yellowstone proved too small a hunting ground and they left the park. Oh-Six died during the transition along with some of her pack and children. The pack was lost without her, and after days of frantic searching for their leader, they broke apart over leadership battles and poor decisions. It was Oh-Six’s leadership and individuality that made her pack so strong; when they lost her they lost a teacher. So, wolves can express individuality, but plenty of other animals can understand the individuality of species other than their own, even of humans. For example, ravens who are tagged by researchers will recognize the person who marked them even years later. The birds respond to these people with loud screeches and attacks. As a result, most researchers now wear masks when catching ravens to avoid being hunted down. But despite having individual personalities, animals – wolves especially – are mired in problems caused by humans and their prejudice. For example, wolves have long been symbols of evil and fear in literature. They represent uncivilized dangers, a lack of law and order. As a result, during the European Middle Ages, wolves were hunted by members of the church who viewed them as the devil’s dog. Thankfully, not all humans treat animals this way, and indigenous peoples have often experienced better outcomes with wild animals like wolves, lions and tigers which they respect. For instance, for a long time in Siberia, tigers would not kill humans, but that all changed with the arrival of settlers who didn’t honor the animals in the same way. If you only looked at their teeth, killer whales would resemble a seafaring T. Rex. But get to know them and you’ll see that they’re cooperative, generous and pose no threat to humans. Why? Killer whales live in extremely complex social systems in which mothers play an essential part. For instance, families live with their matriarch and, while they’ll mate while socializing with other families, will continue to travel with the matriarch afterward as she’s responsible for memorizing the routes and best feeding locations. To communicate, each family uses unique calls but also shares certain common ones with other families whose calls unite them in a pod. Multiple pods form clans, which also employ a specific set of calls. Clans socialize with other clans with the same calls to form a community which will not interact with other killer whale communities. But just how long do matriarchs lead their clans? Actually, they can remain in their position long after entering menopause. This is a rarity in the natural world as, generally, animals who stop reproducing struggle to survive. But with killer whales, elderly matriarchs play a crucial role in the survival of the young. In fact, male killer whales under 30 are three times more likely to die if their mother does because they rely on her for food. Even female whales over 30 are 2.5 times more likely to die when their mother does. Another fun fact about killer whales is that they enjoy sex! That even goes for those who have entered menopause and whales of the same sex. Many killer whales will even masturbate by rubbing against boats or arouse other whales by rubbing against them. So, there are lots of interesting commonalities among killer whales, but they also differ from one another enormously. Different communities keep their distance and those who live off fish don’t socialize with those who eat mammals. They’re still seen as a single species with different types, but the fact that they uniquely self-segregate and don’t interbreed indicates that they’re actually a different species altogether. So killer whales can communicate with each other, but the fact that humans can’t understand them is actually a result of our own poor hearing. Sound travels better in water than in air, so killer whales are vocal creatures, and we just don’t have the ears to hear them properly. Orcas can communicate across distances of 150 miles using sound to send messages and locate fish! Human visual perception is also lacking, which means that what we call visible light is just a fraction of the light that exists. Many animals see more of it or just view it differently than we do – sometimes “seeing” with senses other than sight. Interpreting sounds can be considered a form of vision that even humans can learn. For instance, American campaigner Daniel Kish has been blind since he was one, but he gets around using clicks, like a sonar. He simply clicks in a manner that resonates in the space around him, thereby producing an image of the environment in his mind. He’s so skilled that he can even ride his bike in traffic. So, clearly communication is more than just words. Just take elephants, who can “talk” by making vibrations at frequencies that humans can’t even hear and can barely sense. These amazing animals pick up rumbles made by other elephants over a distance of miles – vibrations unnoticed by humans. Even scent is a form of communication, like the way that flowers speak with insects through their various smells. And if it seemed like the natural world couldn’t get any smarter, think again, because animals can even learn human languages. Dolphins in Hawaii have demonstrated an understanding of syntactical differences after learning some human language – they could discern between the spoken human command to receive a ring from person A to give to person B and the opposite. If that’s not a clear sign that animals are using their heads, then what is? The key message in this book: Every animal is capable of thinking and feeling, but judging other animals based on human experience can cause their abilities to appear limited. The truth is that animals have complex and profound mental capacities, a variety of skills and feelings – just like us. Actionable advice: If you think something is specific to humans, think again. Plenty of things that were once thought of as special to humans have been shown to exist in other animals. For instance, the ability to teach used to be thought distinctly human, but just as cats deliver live prey to their young to show them how to hunt, killer whales instruct their calves to follow them. So give animals more credit, keep your eyes peeled and you might just notice that animals are more like you than you think! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

    "title": "Blueprint",
    "author": "Nicholas A. Christakis",
    "summary": "In a world of Trump, Brexit and populist politics, it’s easy to focus on what divides us. Every day, whether on social media or in our newspapers, commentators line up to explain how our identities are different and how incompatible we all are. But what if all this discourse is simply a vanity of small differences? What if we are actually genetically predestined to be universally similar, in our relationships, our friendships, and even in our cultures?  Let’s take a drive through our evolutionary road map, and learn about the common humanity that unites us all, regardless of nationality, gender, religion, or race. Drawing on cutting-edge insights from his social science laboratory, Professor Nicholas A. Christakis takes a look at how our evolutionary past has shaped our present, and examines the psychological cornerstones of every human society throughout history.  Read on to discover what shipwrecks can teach us about evolution; where romantic love comes from; and how humans are genetically designed for culture. We don’t always need words to understand one another. As a young boy, Christakis was one of the only Greek children to arrive on the Turkish island of Büyükada. Nevertheless, the author and his younger brother quickly made friends, and spent a long summer rampaging around the island with the local boys. They even waged war on rival groups, using pinecones as weapons. In later years, the author reflected on this cross-cultural friendship group. How did it work so well, despite their linguistic and cultural differences? As a researcher of social behavior, the author concluded that these childhood friendships were made possible by a mental manual of social skills, instincts and tendencies, which guide the behavior of every human being on the planet. In other words, there is a universal blueprint for social behavior encoded in our genes. These instincts help us form societies, which can be as small as a group of Turkish and Greek schoolboys united in their search for adventure, or as big as sovereign states composed of hundreds of millions of people. This collection of universal social tendencies, which the author calls the social suite, includes the capacity for love and friendship, as well as teaching and learning from others.  Unfortunately though, the social suite also includes a tendency to favor your own “group.”  A 2011 study, for instance, found that five-year-old children wearing a red T-shirt consequently liked and favored other children also in red T-shirts, and discriminated against those wearing different colors. This prejudice occurred even when the children were told that the colored shirts had been allocated at random. Studies like these demonstrate that humans have an affinity for “likeness” – no matter how small we perceive that likeness to be.  Of course, even if we identify with people similar to us, we don’t consider them all to be the same. Each of us are born with the ability to develop and recognize individual human identities. Just consider the almost universal human practice of using personal names. Although this might seem inconsequential, recognizing individuals is the bedrock of other human traits, such as love and friendship. After all, if we were unable to discriminate between two individuals, we’d have no way of preferring one person over the other, or repaying favors that our friends do for us. The nature versus nurture debate is almost as old as science itself. And for good reason – it is often fiendishly difficult to tell whether any given behavior is a result of our genes or our environment. Unfortunately, social behavior is no different. This begs the question: how can we be sure that the social suite of human behaviors are really inbuilt evolutionary adaptations, rather than spontaneous responses to the situation we find ourselves in? To know for sure, we would have to conduct life-long experiments in which humans were raised in an environment without any pre-existing society or older people, and see how these unfortunate guinea pigs interacted with one another. Of course, ethical considerations make these sorts of studies impossible. Shipwrecks, however, may provide a close substitute for these experimental conditions. Those who survive shipwrecks, for instance, often find themselves washed up on deserted islands without any trace of established human society or infrastructure.  Let’s take a look at the Invercauld and the Grafton, two ships that crashed in 1864 on different sides of Auckland Island, off the coast of New Zealand. Neither group of survivors knew the other was there, and crucially, their survival strategies were very different. The survivors of the Grafton exhibited almost the full social suite of behaviors, with everyone helping one another from the moment their ship ran aground. The Captain’s Mate, for instance, would have died if the rest of the crew hadn’t worked together to pull him out of the water with ropes.  In contrast, the survivors of the Invercauld, within days of coming ashore, left behind the weakest man among them to die. From here, the fate of the Invercauld deteriorated further. The men continually split up, deserted the weak and the sick, and even ate one person. By the time the Invercauld survivors were rescued, only three out of the 19 who had survived the initial wreck remained alive.  And the Grafton community? They continued as they had begun – working together and cooperating to survive. Not only did they remain as one group, which demonstrated their close social bonds, but they also left no man behind. The survivors even set up a makeshift school while they waited for rescue, thereby engaging in teaching and learning – an important social suite behavior. This adherence to typical social behaviour definitely paid off: all the men who made it to shore also made it off the island. These two very different communities clearly show the evolutionary advantage of the social suite in boosting people’s chances of survival. Furthermore, it seems some humans really do have a blueprint for social behaviors, like cooperation, teaching, and helping others, which guide their behaviour even outside of their normal environments. What aspects of sexual relationships are universal? Until recently, the author assumed kissing was universal. But it turns out he was wrong about that. The Tsonga people of Mozambique, for example, do not kiss. In fact, upon hearing of this strange practice, the Tsongas questioned why two people would want to share saliva and all its accompanying germs. This got the author thinking: which traits of human sexual relationships are present across all cultures? The answer, quite simply, is love. In scientific terms, “love” describes a deep emotional connection to one’s partner, beyond feelings of a mere sexual nature. Some experts believe that the development of love within couples was an evolutionary accident. In their opinion, humans originally only felt an emotional affinity for their children. However, over time, this love for our offspring extended to our mates, too. This process – where one evolutionary adaptation is repurposed into another – is known as exaptation. In this respect, the evolution of human romantic love has much in common with the evolution of flight amongst birds. Birds, it is believed, first grew feathers to keep themselves warm, but later these were repurposed to help them fly. Similarly, humans initially felt love only for their offspring, but later redistributed it to include their sexual partners too. The evolutionary explanation for this romantic love may be that it helped ensure a family stayed together during periods of pregnancy and child-rearing, thus improving the chances of their offspring’s survival. Interestingly, it’s only in the last two thousand years that monogamy has overtaken polygyny as the most widely practiced form of romantic relationships. How can we explain this switch? Well, anthropologists believe that monogamy confers particular advantages on societies. In monogamous communities, for instance, every man can have a partner. In contrast, in a polygynous set-up, many men are inevitably left without wives. Crucially, these unattached men, without hope of a family and children of their own, tend to feel less invested in the future. This bleak outlook makes them more likely to engage in antisocial behavior such as violence, theft and rape. Their bad conduct then destabilizes the whole society; diminishing its resources and making it less productive. We can see evidence of this behaviour in countries like China, where sex-selective abortion practices have created a schewed gender ratio, resulting in more men than women. Sure enough, evidence suggests that these ‘leftover’ young men, tend to live more violent lives and die younger than their married counterparts. On December 17, 2015, 15-year-old Zavien Dobson was sitting on his porch with three friends in Tennessee, when a car pulled up and opened fire on them. Zavien didn’t hesitate. He threw himself on top of his female companions and died in a hail of bullets. Thanks to his actions that day, each of his friends survived this random and senseless attack. In light of Zavien’s moving sacrifice, the author began wondering: why do we feel such love for our friends?  Hearteningly, evidence suggests that friendship is a universal feature of nearly all human societies. Furthermore, it seems that the vast majority of cultures share the same core essentials of friendship ⁠⁠– namely, affection, trust and mutual aid. Another universal trait of friendship appears to be the acceptance of our vulnerability. You may not mind being teased by a friend, for instance, because you trust that they mean well.  But not all friendship traits are universal. While disclosing personal information and regularly socializing with one another are seen as important aspects of friendships in the United States, these attributes are not common in all cultures. In other regions of the world, physical contact rather is a typical expression of friendship. In 2005, for example, many Americans were surprised to see the US President George W. Bush holding hands with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. To Saudi Arabians, however, it was a natural gesture of friendship.  Clearly, friendship comes in many shapes and sizes. But beyond its various expressions around the world, why do humans engage in it at all?  Experts believe that the ability to develop and maintain friendships gave our ancestors an evolutionary advantage. In the earliest human societies, a lack of food, or bad weather, illness or injury were constant threats to you and your offspring’s chances of survival. And if you wanted to survive these precarious circumstances, it was important to have relationships with people you could rely on to help you out in times of need. These needed to be people who weren’t always expecting something in return. In other words, you needed genuine friends. This is still somewhat true today. In poorer American communities, for instance, people are more likely to call on their friends for childcare, loans and home repairs than their middle-class counterparts. In 2005, Amazon launched a software system that enabled them to hire tens of thousands of part-time workers to complete minor online tasks. This massive platform is known as Amazon Mechanical Turk, and its creation allowed the company to recruit workers, record their contribution and pay them accordingly. Before long, social scientists realized they could use the Turk system to set up artificial “communities” of users and see how they responded, individually and as a group, to tasks set by the researchers. For the author and his laboratory, this vast online apparatus represented an exciting opportunity to explore the social suite of behaviors. He and his team set out to learn whether Turk users would still display these supposedly universal social behaviors online, or whether this brand new environment would prompt them to behave in brand new ways.  When it came to one of the most distinctive human traits of all – cooperation – the author’s studies were illuminating. One experiment saw his team set up 40 different social networks, with Turk users randomly dropped into each one. Each person in every network also had a unique set of neighbors. Every round, the researchers gave one individual from each of the networks a sum of money. They were told that they could either keep this money for themselves or give it to their neighbor. If they did the latter, then the gift to their neighbor would be doubled – meaning their neighbor would be left significantly better off, and they would be left poorer. However, they were also made aware that, in the next round, their neighbor could choose to reciprocate and give them money, whereupon the amount would also be doubled. By structuring the experiment in this way, the researchers cleverly gave each network a choice – cooperate and potentially make more money, or choose not to cooperate and make much less. So, what did Turk users choose to do? In those networks where everybody donated to their neighbors, cooperation was the norm. However, in the groups where just one person began to keep their money for themselves, defection spread like wildfire. This just goes to show that, while cooperation seems to be a natural human behavior, it is fragile and will perish under certain conditions. Humans and animals share many similarities. Up until 1964, scientists were stumped as to how to repair damage caused to heart valves by cardiovascular disease. That was until a French surgeon called Alain Carpentier tried replacing them altogether, with valves transplanted from pigs. Incredibly, his technique worked, and is still used today. Clearly then, our organs have a lot in common with those of pigs. But what if animals are similar to us in even more subtle ways? As science progresses, we are increasingly faced with an uncomfortable truth: that the very same animals we eat and experiment on might share many features of our social suite. Evidence suggests, for example, that elephants have friends, gorillas have their own language, and rats feel empathy. Not convinced? Then just consider the parallels between capuchin monkeys’ social behaviour, and our own. These South American primates put their fingers into other monkeys’ mouths and allow them to gently bite down on them, thus exhibiting the apparently human trait of accepting vulnerability in front of one’s friends. Observations like these indicate that we share many traits with other animals. But how did this come to be? The answer lies in a process known as evolutionary convergence. This describes the phenomenon whereby different species arrive at the same evolutionary adaptation separately. Birds and bats, for instance, both evolved separately to have flight. Similarly, humans and some other species – such as elephants, whales and apes – have all evolved separately to share many social traits, like cooperation, recognizing individual identity and even social learning. The reason for this convergence is that all of these species, including our own, share almost identical environments. Of course, it is not the plains of the Savanna or the oceans that we share, but our social environments.  Animals like humans, elephants and apes have evolved in the presence of other members of the same species, with whom we needed to live, interact, and get along with to survive. This meant that those individuals who were more social, and exhibited behaviors such as cooperation, trust and friendship were better adapted to their environment, and thus more likely to pass their social genes down to the next generation. In turn, the most social of these offspring were also more likely to survive, and this natural selection continued until an optimal type of social behavior emerged. It is this optimal behavior that seems to comprise the social suite, which has been arrived at separately by many different species around the world. The human race is scattered across the world. As a species, we’ve made our homes almost everywhere, from the freezing temperatures of the Arctic to the humid Amazonian rainforests. But how exactly have our genetics helped us survive these hugely variable environments? As it turns out, our genes have enabled us to prosper by endowing us with the ability to develop culture. In an evolutionary sense, culture refers to knowledge that’s transmitted from person-to-person within a group, which then influences individuals’ behavior. Furthermore, culture is an evolutionary adaptation in itself, in that natural selection has equipped us with genes that can create culture. Our genetics give us relatively long lives, for instance, providing plenty of chances for information to be passed on between generations. Humans also have several psychological features that seem tailor-made for culture, like our desire for conformity between individuals and our tendency to mimic the behavior of older individuals. Extremely young children, for example, have been found to regularly copy every action they see an adult performing, no matter how trivial the behavior might be.  Another important aspect of human culture is that, much like the process of natural selection itself, it can evolve and become better adapted to the environment to which it must respond. In the same way that genetic mutations may lead to survival advantages, great ideas may be implemented rather than mediocre ones, thus become part of a group’s ongoing culture.  But culture isn’t just optimized for survival – it’s absolutely crucial. Just consider the many European adventurers who got lost on expeditions to faraway places. Without cultural knowledge of their environment, they all too often perished. Their clothes fell apart, their equipment became useless and their food and water supplies dwindled. In the most extreme cases when several explorers got lost together, they sometimes even resorted to cannibalism. In other words, these Europeans were like fish out of water; they simply did not have enough information about their environment to survive. For this same reason, the only explorers who made it out alive were typically the ones who contacted local people – natives who could locate food and water, cook potentially deadly plants and who may have known the medicinal qualities of local flora too. The knowledge these natives possessed of their specific culture meant that they knew how to survive, and could share this invaluable information.  The key message in these blinks: Every human being on the planet, regardless of where they come from, shares a fundamental set of social tendencies and preferences known as the social suite. The ability to cooperate, learn and form loving relationships with one another are all part of this suite. These traits have been central to our ability to survive. But the unique success of the human species also depends on our aptitude for developing culture. Without it, we are bound to perish. Got feedback?

    "synopsis": "Shoe Dog (2016) tells the story of the man behind the famous footwear company Nike. These blinks offer a peek into the mind of genius entrepreneur Phil Knight and detail the rollercoaster ride he went to through to build up his company.",
    "summary": "What's in it for me? Follow the quirky beginnings and meteoric rise of footwear empire. You certainly know the successful tagline of footwear giant Nike:Just Do It. It captures the daring spirit of Nike cofounder Phil Knight in the early years of his company. In these blinks, you'll discover how Knight fumbled his way to greatness, reaching out to business people across the world to make his way in the running shoe business with preparation whatsoever. You'll learn how he led a team of creative misfits, stood his ground in two major lawsuits and handled a truly infamous scandal - all the while building one of the more powerful brands the world has ever seen. In these blinks, you'll also learn why the name \"Nike\" is perfect for running shoes; how a new type of glue helps factory workers all over to avoid cancer; and why an Olympic coach experimented with fish-skin shoes. Nike's path to success started with a \"crazy idea\" and a trip around the world. It was 1962 and Phil Knight was fresh out of business school. He was shy and a terrible salesperson. But that didn't stop him from following a vision he had. Phil wanted to import Japanese running shoes to America and had his eye on the Tiger brand that was manufactured by the Japanese company Onitsuka. The idea had first occurred to him while he was at Stanford Business School. At the time, neither his professors, classmates or even his father thought much of it. But that didn't stop Phil, who traveled across the Pacific to sell his bold proposition to a room full of Japanese businessmen. He didn't expect the pitch to be a success, but when the Onitsuka CEO told him that his timing was perfect and asked him the name of the company with which he would be working, Phil was stunned. Completely unprepared, he blurted out the name, \"Blue Ribbon.\" Onitsuka then agreed to send him 300 pairs of Tiger shoes to start him off. Over the next several months, Phil would sell the Japanese shoes out of the trunk of his car! After securing the deal with Onitsuka, Phil traveled the world. During his travels, he found a lot of inspiration through the things he saw and experienced. Much of what he learned about the cultures he explored would influence him later in life. For instance, Phil was particularly inspired by the Greek Acropolis. He found himself standing in front of the Temple of Nike, the goddess of victory, for hours on end. Years later, Phil came across a play written by ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes called \"The Knights.\" In it, a warrior gifts the king a new pair of shoes – in the Temple of Nike. Phil Knight's former running coach modified the early Tiger shoes they received and put Blue Ribbon in play. Many people have someone in their lives who inspires them, and whose respect they value. For Phil Knight, this person was his former running coach, Bill Bowerman. Bill's approval gave Phil the confidence he needed to carry on with his dreams. Bill, in turn, was a genuine \"shoe dog.\" A \"shoe dog\" is an industry term for someone who is shoe-obsessed. Such a person understands the shoe's role in allowing men and women to stride into the future with confidence. When Phil had run for Bill, he was his coach's unofficial shoe guinea pig. Bill was always experimenting to see how small changes in footwear would affect the performance of his athletes. To do so, he would tear apart shoes and put them back together using whatever materials he thought would make the shoes an asset and not a mere necessity. His primary goal was to make shoes as light as possible – a feature which would later become a trademark of the Nike brand. Bill was so obsessed with this goal that he once used cod fish skin instead of leather to make a lighter pair of shoes. When Phil returned from Japan, he went to see Bill, asking him to partner with him at Blue Ribbon. Bill agreed, and Phil got a big confidence boost. He began to believe that his \"crazy idea\" might amount to something. Indeed, the cooperation was successful. Timing again was key. When Blue Ribbon was in its infancy, Bill's coaching career was picking up steam. He was even training future Olympians. As he altered the imported Tiger shoes for his star runners, Bill helped to give the brand more exposure, helping Phil sell more pairs. Phil also sent Bill's first modified shoe prototype, the Cortez, to Onitsuka, suggesting that the company manufacture these new, performance-tested shoes. Onitsuka agreed, and Cortez was Blue Ribbon's first sales success. In this fashion, Bill helped the young company get off the ground. The continued success of Blue Ribbon, however, was in large part because of Phil's unconventional, yet brilliant, employees. Talented eccentrics made up the early Blue Ribbon team, and they all helped make key decisions. As Blue Ribbon grew, Phil put together a team of trustworthy people who in turn trusted him. But Blue Ribbon workers weren't your run-of-the-mill corporate types. They were instead a bunch of brilliant misfits who formed a great team. They may have worked so well together precisely because they ere misfits. This fact allowed each team member to see past a coworker's quirks to the genius within. No one felt he had to hold back. From the get go, Blue Ribbon employees all believed in Phil and his vision. The company's first full-time employee, Jeff Johnson, worked tirelessly, designing innovative shoes alongside Bill Bowerman. To keep the Blue Ribbon team strong, a few times each year Phil would hold his version of a team-building weekend that he called \"Buttfaces.\" At this event, everyone could yell at each other before getting drunk. It was a reminder that no one was too important to be mocked. Yet drunken shouting matches weren't the only way Phil maintained morale. He also involved his team in many company decisions. When it came to everyday work, Phil followed General Patton's words of wisdom: \"Don't tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.\" Phil, for example, never once told Jeff Johnson how to do his job. He never even gave Jeff a hard time for sending him countless letters, with subjects ranging from advertising questions to poems and even jokes. Phil included his team when bigger decisions needed to be made, too. In 1971, it was decided that the company would stop selling Onitsuka shoes and begin making its own. However, the Blue Ribbon brand wasn't suitable for this move, and so a successor company needed to be developed. Rather than branding this new business himself, Phil asked his employees to suggest names for it. Surprisingly, the name Nike came to Jeff Johnson in a dream. Phil went with it, remembering the impression the Temple of Nike had made on him so many years ago in Athens. \nLawsuits brought by Onitsuka and the government threatened Nike, but the company persevered. Many successful entrepreneurs know that fame and fortune are always dogged by obstacles and pitfalls. Specifically, for Phil Knight, two significant lawsuits threatened to stop his career dead in its tracks. The first arrived in 1973 when Onitsuka attempted to sue Blue Ribbon in Japan for costs that had been incurred through a breach of contract – a breach that occurred when Blue Ribbon started producing and distributing Nike shoes. To defend itself, Blue Ribbon sued Onitsuka in the United States for breach of contract as well as trademark infringement. Blue Ribbon had an exclusive contract to distribute Tiger's track-and-field line in America. Yet Phil had an informant at Onitsuka, who tipped him off that an Onitsuka executive was planning a trip to America in search of a replacement distributor. Armed with this information, Phil shifted his focus to building his new company, Nike. Eventually, the lawsuit resulted in a favorable judgment for Blue Ribbon. The judge said his decision was based on which of the two companies was more honest – and that in this particular case, Blue Ribbon was the most honest partner. Onitsuka was ordered to pay damages. This was just the first major threat to Phil and his work. The second came in 1977, when Nike was told that it owed the government $25 million. The trouble started when Nike's competitors in America, Keds and Converse, worked together to uncover an obscure customs law called the American Selling Price law, whereby certain types of shoes would incur significantly higher customs duties. They accused Nike of violating it. But Phil wasn't going to give up without a fight. His belief that Nike was innocent helped Phil through the stressful situation. So while Phil wanted the government to drop its claim altogether, he eventually took the recommendation of a trusted advisor and as a diplomatic gesture settled the claim for $9 million. Phil felt that if he fought the government's claim tooth and nail, he'd never regain its goodwill, something his company might need at a later date. Phil Knight feared an IPO would taint the unique culture at Nike, yet its spirit stayed strong. Clearly, Phil faced some obstacles on his rise to the top. It took a lot of hard work to keep going. So how did Nike grow to become the company it is today? Although he wasn't always sure what winning meant to him, Phil knew that he didn't want to lose. This was partly due to a fear of disappointing his father and partly because he thought work should be both playful and meaningful. The combination convinced him that he had to avoid a passive life that just seemed to \"slip\" by. So while Phil knew that taking Nike public could solve some financial problems, his desire to keep his business playful and fun made him hesitant to do so. In short, Phil ran his business according to the motto, \"grow or die\". This meant that aside from the money he used to pay the modest salaries he and his received, all profits were invested in the business, helping it to grow. This financing strategy meant that Phil was reliant on banks, which often refused him the large loans he requested.In the banks' stead, Japanese trading company Nissho helped Nike with financing. But eventually, the $25 million lawsuit brought by the government pushed Phil into taking Nike public with an initial public offering. Yet he still worried that an IPO would cost him control of the company and its unique code of ethics, transforming Nike into yet another corporate machine. Thankfully, one of Phil's associates had an innovative idea of how to design the company's share structure to prevent this, ensuring Nike remained in charge. To this day, the company prides itself on its integrity, to which it also attributes much of its worldwide success. Through improving factory working conditions and treating sponsored athletes well, Nike strives to stay true to its values. Since its origins, Nike as a company has approached setbacks with the same integrity and energy that Phil always demanded of each and every employee. It's this attitude that has kept customers loyal through thick and thin. Nike is now working hard to set better labor standards for its factory workers. In the nineties, the company found itself at the center of a damaging report on the abysmal working conditions of Asian sweatshops. Nike rented workspace in these factories just like many other corporations did. Yet the report's author knew that Nike's name recognition would draw media attention, and thus the footwear company became the center of the story. Nike had worked hard to increase the wages of its factory workers, but was stopped in one country by a top government official who said that factory workers who earned more than doctors would be bad for the economy. But after the shameful exposure, Phil and his team knew they had to try harder. One of the primary means by which the company improved factory conditions was the invention of a water-based bonding agent to attach shoe uppers to the soles of a shoe. This was a huge development. The so-called rubber room was previously the most carcinogenic area in a shoe factory. Nike's new bonding agent cut out 97 percent of the toxins found in the previous one. In fact, Nike even shared the new glue with its competitors, and they began using it in their factories. And Nike's commitment to integrity doesn't stop at the factory door. Phil treats all Nike's sponsored athletes as real people and not just vehicles for selling products. Because of this respect, many Nike-sponsored athletes have become Phil's personal friends. When Phil's son died in a scuba diving accident, for example, every single Nike athlete wrote or called to offer condolences. In the years that followed, one athlete in particular became good friends with Phil: Tiger Woods. In conclusion, few global companies have as much heart as Nike.
