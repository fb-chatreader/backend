[{"title":"Dark Territory","author":"Fred Kaplan","summary":"These days, whenever there’s a national election, we assume there will also be a certain amount of online interference in the form of cyber warfare – maybe even from some shady source of organized crime. But how did we get to this point? This is the story that author Fred Kaplan tells. From the early days of spy versus spy and tapped phone lines, to the modern-day, seven-billion-dollar US cyber-defense program, the cyber wars have been growing fast and show no sign of slowing down. So let’s take a look at some of the bigger battles in the cyber wars – the ones that have raised the stakes and caused the US government to take notice and beef up its security. In these blinks, you’ll find how the NSA got the US government to take cybercrime seriously; which attack on the Department of Defense changed the rules of the game; and how cyber attacks were used for peaceful means in the 1990s. You might think that the first people to hack into a communication network were, say, a band of pioneering computer experts who used a primitive form of the internet. However, there is a rich history of communications interception that dates back much further. During the American Civil War, for example, generals knew that their telegraph messages were being intercepted, so they would routinely issue fake orders to send the enemy on a wild goose chase. And during World War II, American and British cryptographers decoded crucial messages sent by German and Japanese forces – communication interceptions that played a vital role in the Allied victory. Then we come to the Cold War, the heyday of spies and tapped phone lines, as well as intercepted radio signals and microwave transmissions. Agents on both sides of the Iron Curtain were eager to learn what the other was capable of and intended to do. When we reach the information age – or, as some call it, the cyber age – we can see how the art of communications interception transformed into a type of warfare. At this stage, those hacking into communication lines weren’t just trying to listen in and acquire information; they were now prowling through entire computer networks. And while doing so they could erase, block and change information – anything to mislead or slow down an enemy that could be as far away as the other side of the globe. This is cyber warfare. The advent of the internet played a big role in raising the stakes of communications interception. For the first time, all of the world’s computers – even those containing top secret and classified information – were essentially connected to one big network. Even if the information is encrypted, everyone knows it’s just a matter of time before a program is developed that can break the code. During the Obama administration, the president was given daily reports on cyber attacks being conducted by nations like China and Russia. While this is unsettling enough, even more worrisome is the fact that missiles, uranium-enrichment labs and dam valves are all controlled through computers networks. This is why cyber warfare has come to be an integral part of military operations around the world. In 2009, the Obama administration created a cyber-command unit, whose annual budget rose from $2.7 billion to $7 billion in the three years after its establishment. April 19, 1995 started off as just another day in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, in Oklahoma City. But shortly after 9 a.m., a group of militant anarchists, led by a young Gulf War veteran named Timothy McVeigh, set off a bomb in the building that killed 168 people and injured another 600. All told, the blast damaged or destroyed a total of 325 buildings in the area. From this moment on, the US government was determined to crack down on terrorist attacks, especially ones that targeted federal buildings and the country’s infrastructure. It quickly became apparent that the nation needed to strengthen its cybersecurity, too. In 1997, President Clinton approved a commission to address the issue of terrorism. It was headed by Robert T. Marsh, who enlisted the help of Willis Ware. Ware was a pioneering computer engineer and the former head of the RAND Corporation, an analytical research institute with deep ties to government security. Ware helped convince Marsh that cybersecurity was of the utmost importance. Back in 1967, Ware had written a paper called Security and Privacy in Computer Systems as a response to the US government’s desire to launch the ARPANET program. ARPA, or the Advanced Research Project Agency, was made up of scientists from around the country who were working on military weapons and defense projects. In an attempt to make it easier for these scientists to communicate with one another, computer consoles in each of the universities were hooked up to a single network: the ARPANET.    Willis Ware’s paper was critical of the idea of the ARPANET. Ware worried that enemies of America might be able to break into the network and steal valuable information. But, though Ware’s paper was shared in federal circles, the consensus was that Russia and other potential threats were ill-equipped to pull off such an advanced cyber attack, and the network was formed. But 30 years down the line, after the ARPANET had essentially transformed into the internet, Ware’s concerns seemed much more justified. Computer networks and systems everywhere represented a real threat. Within its first six months, the Marsh Commission released a report that called for a far more robust cybersecurity program in the US. But the response wasn’t what Marsh or Ware hoped it would be. Once again, the warnings fell on deaf ears, and the Clinton administration made no immediate efforts. The Clinton administration was slow to react to the warnings of the report from the Marsh Commission. But that doesn’t mean everyone in the US government was blind to the threat of cyber attacks. In fact, during the late nineties, cyber attacks were increasingly monitored. For instance, the secretary of defense, Bill Perry, advocated for more cybersecurity, a position that drew him to a three-star general named Kenneth Minihan. Minihan, in his role as the intelligence chief at the Kelly Air Force Base, had helped devise new ways of monitoring cyber attacks. Minihan’s efforts contributed to the creation of a software called Network Security Monitoring. Invented by the computer scientist Todd Heberlein, this software detected unwanted network intrusions on open networks that connected multiple computers. So, in 1996, Perry had Minihan installed as the new director of the NSA (National Security Agency), thinking that he’d be able to push the NSA to focus more on cyber warfare and less on microwave signals and phone monitoring. Things didn’t exactly go as planned, however. At the time, the nation was embroiled in a debate over just how much network monitoring the government could do, since average civilians were part of that same network. Developments in cybersecurity were slowed to a snail’s pace. Finally, in 1997, the NSA changed the rules of the game by launching a simulated cyber attack under the code name Eligible Receiver. The aim of Eligible Receiver was to break into the Defense Department’s computer network. The NSA wanted to see how US leaders and government facilities would handle a cyber attack. Though they’d predicted it’d take two weeks, the NSA was able to penetrate the Defense Department’s entire network in a mere four days. This includes accessing the National Military Command Center, which is the unit responsible for transmitting orders from the president during wartime. This proved two big points: Clearly, the government was ill prepared for any serious cyber attack, and cyber warfare was far more dangerous than people had thought. After the NSA’s Eligible Receiver exercise exposed the US government’s vulnerability, progress began to be made in the cyber-security field. Before the simulated attack, only a quarter of the servers at the Defense Department were connected to an intrusion-detection system (IDS). After the Eligible Receiver, they were all hooked up. But these systems, though finally put in place, weren’t run very smoothly. In fact, many command units failed to appoint anyone to be in charge of monitoring the IDS. Even if someone was in charge, many generals and military staff had no idea how the system worked. A few months after the installment of the IDS, a Defense Department general complained to Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre. The system must be faulty, the general said. After all, it seemed to indicate that attacks were occurring every day. The general didn’t understand that the system was actually trying to warn him; real hacks were in fact being attempted on a daily basis. More progress was made in 1998 with the establishment of the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Defense (JTF-CNF). Following a very real and effective cyber attack earlier in the year, known as the Moonlight Maze attack, the JTF-CNF was created and led by Brigadier General John “Soup” Campbell. The task force was charged with the sole purpose of protecting the computer systems and networks of the Department of Defense. It established a 24/7 watch program, as well as strict notification procedures to follow when anything suspicious happened. If this seems like a drastic response, that’s because, as we’ll see in the next blink, Moonlight Maze was a pretty serious attack. So what exactly happened in the Moonlight Maze attack? Well, it all started at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in March 1998, when personnel became aware that hackers had accessed their servers. However, since the hackers rewrote the activity log, it was not only hard to identify and catch them, it was difficult to spot their activity at all. In other words, the criminals were doing a good job of covering their tracks. After months of frustration, the intelligence team decided to try to trap the cyber attackers by using a “honeypot” – in this case, a collection of fake files made to look like real directories, passwords and usernames. The team figured it would be the perfect trap. No hacker would be able to resist the information and it would take time to browse the fake files, time during which the team would track the hacker’s IP address and figure out where the attack was coming from. When the trap was set and sprung, they discovered that the IP address was from the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Now, since it could have been a fake address or simply a point of entry for someone elsewhere in the world, the intelligence team had to investigate further. First, they were able to look at the hacker’s activity logs to learn which topics interested them. Then they checked data on recent scientific conferences and their attendees. It turned out that Russian scientists had indeed been present at conferences focusing on the – rather diverse – topics that had interested the hackers. While this suggested that the IP address was real, and that the perpetrators were Russian, it wasn’t a closed case quite yet. Someone outside of Russia could still be accessing the address remotely. The team then turned its attention to the code the hackers were using to cover their tracks. After developing new software, the team was able to break the code to reveal that it had been originally written in Cyrillic, the writing system popular in, among other places, Eastern Europe and Russia. It was enough evidence for a US delegation to travel to Moscow, where it was confirmed that the hackers behind Moonlight Maze were indeed agents of the Russian government. During the 1990s, the nations comprising the former Yugoslav Federation were embroiled in a string of insurgencies, conflicts and battles for independence: the Yugoslav Wars.   In 1995, a peace treaty was signed that was meant to end Serbia’s war on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following that, a Stabilization Force (SFOR) consisting of members from the United States and other NATO-allied countries was established. It was stationed in the region to ensure that Serbian president Slobodan Milošević honored the treaty. As it turned out, Milošević had no intention of honoring the treaty. When he resumed aggressive actions, the SFOR reached out to a secret unit in the Pentagon called J-39. Part of the joint chiefs of staff unit, J-39 consisted of top US military chiefs, and they agreed to enlist the help of the NSA and other intelligence agencies to stop Milošević. At the forefront of strategies used by the J-39 were a series of cyber attacks. Since the Serbian air-defense system was linked to the civilian phone system, J-39 was able to hack into it. That enabled NATO’s commander, General Wesley Clark, to ascertain how the air-defense system operated and where its vulnerabilities were. J-39 was also able to intercept communications between Milošević and his accomplices and moneymen. This provided valuable information about where Milošević’s money was coming from and how his warfare was being funded. For example, some of Milošević’s biggest donations came from an owner of a copper mine. Upon getting this intelligence, J-39 contacted the donor and threatened to bomb his mine if he didn’t stop supplying Milošević with money. At first, the threat didn’t work. But when NATO forces were able to cut off electricity to the mine, the donor gave in and ceased funding the Serbian despot. In the new millennium, cyber warfare has expanded in many troubling ways. While cyber attacks have long been used to steal money or state secrets, it is now common for an attack to be motivated purely by politics. The story of one such attack begins in October 2013, at Yeshiva University, in New York. Taking part in a heated political discussion was the Las Vegas billionaire and pro-Israel right-winger Sheldon Adelson. When the topic of the ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the Obama administration came up, Adelson proposed the tactic of detonating a small nuclear bomb in the desert. The idea was not to cause anyone harm, but to warn Iran that the United States could, if it so desired, wipe them off the map. A few months later, in early 2014, the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, where Adelson is CEO and chairman, had its systems hacked into by Iranians. The perpetrators successfully installed malware that destroyed 20,000 computers and all of the company’s data. The hackers also posted a prominent and clearly visible message on the company’s website, stating that it was a crime to encourage the use of nuclear weapons in any capacity. They did not, however, take even one penny of Adelson’s money. A similar cyber attack occurred later that same year. This time the aggressors were North Korean hackers and the target was Sony Pictures Entertainment. SPE was the distributor of the comedic film The Interview, which featured a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The hackers didn’t plunder the company’s fortunes. Rather, they destroyed thousands of computers while stealing internal emails and other sensitive information, such as employee Social Security numbers, executive salary details and copies of unreleased films. They then began leaking this information to media outlets, some of which were unscrupulous enough to publish. This leak only stopped when Sony announced that The Interview wouldn’t be released. The attack had succeeded. So what can be done to stop cyber attacks? Or are they simply something we should get used to? Even as technology continues to grow and advance in impressive ways, there is still no way to keep everyone safe and secure from cyber attacks. Surprisingly enough, today’s cyber-warfare problems are by and large the same as they were when the first hackers started to appear. What’s been happening is this: when advancements are made in network defense, the attackers make their own advancements in evading those defenses. So, despite attempts by the US government to create and install software that can detect and withstand cyber attacks, hackers are still a threat. It’s always just a matter of time before the new line of defense is penetrated.   This is also the assessment given in a 2013 report by the Defense Science Board task force. They also concluded that the threat of cyber attacks will persist as long as networks are used to connect computers. Today, our systems and networks are more connected than ever before. This has made it easier for us to communicate and coordinate, but it’s also made us extremely vulnerable. If a hacker can get into one system, there’s almost no limit to where he could go. In other words, vulnerability is inherent in network connectivity. In 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates cooked up a name for the current state of cyberspace. He called it dark territory. As Gates explained, the term came from the railroad industry. Gates grew up in Kansas, and his grandfather worked as a stationmaster for the Santa Fe Railroad. At the time, railroad workers used the term “dark territory” to describe portions of the railroad tracks where signals didn’t exist and no one really knew for sure what was going on. Gates saw cyberspace in similar terms: a “train” could enter the dark territory of a network and cause catastrophic damage. And, since cyberspace is immense, it’s likely that no one would notice the devastation until it’s too late. The key message in these blinks: Cyber warfare – both how we can use it and how it can be used against us – deserves a great deal of attention. It took years for US officials to realize just how devastating a cyber attack can be. We should learn from the past and understand that it continues to be a serious and inescapable problem that requires special attention and resources.  Got feedback?

When you notice that someone has written a nasty comment about Justin Bieber on your favorite Bieber music video, it’s easy to reply with a simple “u suck!” and never have to worry about the consequences. But while your YouTube enemy may never uncover your identity, and while you might erase your browser history and encrypt your devices with secure passwords, even so – your online data is still easily procured and monitored. And with this data, companies learn all sorts of interesting things about what you do online; and from this, we can learn a lot about human behavior in general. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: that white men really do love The Allman Brothers Band; why the word “pizza” is a force that binds all humans; and why being less attractive can actually get you more dates. When researchers interview people about sensitive issues, they have to account for a certain degree of dishonesty. Even when we voluntarily participate in a study, that doesn’t mean that questions – or our honest answers – won’t embarrass us. The internet, and in this case data from dating website OkCupid, has enabled researchers to gather unfiltered information directly from the source. For example, the data reveals that heterosexual men and women typically prefer the same types of partners, respectively. When men are interviewed about their age preferences for the opposite sex, for instance, they tend to give numbers closer to their own age. However, data from OkCupid profiles reveals that most men actually prefer women in their early 20s. OkCupid’s profile ratings data also shows that women tend to prefer men who are older than they are – that is, until the men reach their 30s. At that point, women will show a preference for both older men and men who are their own age. The data also demonstrates qualitative differences in men’s and women’s preferences, namely: men are most interested in physical attributes, while women are more interested in materialistic things, such as social status and wealth. In addition, and despite common wisdom, being seen as conventionally attractive is not always beneficial when seeking a partner online. In fact, having a low profile rating on dating sites can actually bring you more attention. A woman with a rating of two out of ten, for instance, is more likely to find a match than a “perfect ten.” The assumption is that there is less competition for the lower-scoring woman as a partner, which in turn means a greater chance of success for an interested man. Conversely, a woman with a higher score may give people the impression that the competition for her attention is high, and so she becomes less appealing to potential suitors. Some people believe that the internet has degraded our cognitive abilities and distracted us from having a real social life. However, even critics cannot deny that the internet has vastly improved our abilities in at least one art form: writing. Thanks to social media, we write far more than previous generations ever did. Indeed, the internet is a writer’s world. Whether it’s teenagers on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Snapchat, or career bloggers, the very foundations of internet communication require the written word. Even when posting non-text media, such as photos or videos, words are crucial to caption and provide context, comment on the material or discuss it with others. Amazingly, there will be more written on Twitter in the next two years than all the words in all the books ever printed. Not only is writing online ubiquitous, but social media platforms such as Twitter may actually improve our writing skills. Twitter’s 140-character limit, for example, forces users to exercise brevity in order to express themselves.   Research shows that, despite the character limits, writing on Twitter isn’t “dumbed down.” For instance, abbreviations such as “u” in place of “you” are no more prevalent on Twitter than they are on any other medium, and has everything to do with the individual preferences of the user. Moreover, the need to be concise on Twitter can actually be a good thing. Linguists, for example, have measured Twitter’s lexical density, finding that its proportion of “content-carrying words,” such as verbs and nouns, are not only higher than in emails, but even comparable to the writing on Slate, the control used for magazine-level syntax. So, although the medium is changing, we are all still writing, and writing a lot, whether it’s through misspelled status updates, Instagram captions or eloquent tweets. Even before social media, interpersonal interaction has always been viewed as important. We even see this reflected in the way we design spaces – such as the bathrooms at Pixar. To force interdepartmental small talk, Pixar decided to put the only bathrooms in the building in its central atrium. The idea was that bringing people together – even if it means on the way to the bathroom –  would bring about the collision and synthesis of innovative ideas. Ideas, start-ups, movies or anything else that requires a signal boost through word-of-mouth communication is usually spread by people to which you have only loose ties. So, it’s very important to maintain connections with people in general. Think about it – you don’t have to be someone’s best friend to overhear a movie recommendation on the train, and perhaps become inspired to check it out yourself. In fact, we’ve known since the 1970s that innovations come from intersecting ideas, but thanks to robust online data, we are now even more convinced this is the case. Indeed, the cat videos that go viral and are shared with millions of people globally prove that “word of mouth” knows no geographic boundaries. Social connections aren’t just for cute cat videos, however; they can also affect your romantic relationships.   For instance, Facebook data shows that you and your spouse are the link between two different social groups. However, the more connections you have in common, the more likely you are to stay together. In contrast, the fewer mutual friends you share with your spouse on Facebook, the more likely it is that you’ll be disconnected in real life. This can lead to having separate lives, which can quickly escalate to having “secret lives,” followed shortly by a potentially nasty breakup. Now that you’ve learned a bit about how behavioral data from the web can be applied, the next blinks will examine the differences in how people express themselves publicly and privately. How often have we been told not to judge a book by its cover? Or not to make a snap judgment after meeting someone for only a moment? We do it anyway, and eventually these judgments transform into schemas, theories or thought-models which then stick with us. Everyone has their own set of expectations and attitudes which often are not logical. Let’s look at what happened when OkCupid introduced an app, Crazy Blind Love, which allowed two users to exchange information to set up a date in the immediate future. While it sounded good, the app ultimately failed. But why? The problem was that users weren’t able see what their potential date looked like until they actually met. People absolutely “judge a book by its cover,” and thus wanted the opportunity to judge their potential dates solely on how they look. And yet, those who did meet through the app gave it exceptional ratings, showing that appearances and conventional attractiveness had little if nothing to do with how well the date went. Darker still, people are pervasively racist. While it’s no longer socially acceptable to express overt racism, internet data reveals that people still hold racist ideas and beliefs. Taking a look at the numbers, Google data reveals that the “N-word” appears in seven million searches per year. Google’s autocomplete feature, which finishes search terms as you type them based on past searches from other users, are often plagued with racist queries. Examples include such queries as: “Why do black people like fried chicken?” “Why do Asians look alike?” and “Why do Muslims hate America?” If people cannot be openly racist, then they will simply keep their racism out of public view – at least when it can’t easily be traced back to them. Have you ever made the mistake of scrolling through the comments on a YouTube video? Often, comments degrade quickly to bickering, in which people insult each other over things completely unrelated to the video itself. Unfortunately, this kind of vitriol is all too easy to find in every corner of the internet. But why? Basically, people are cruel when there are no consequences for their actions. The anonymity of the internet allows people to act with a total lack of restraint, also called the online disinhibition effect. Hateful people figure that, since nobody knows their true identity, they can write whatever they want, no matter how hurtful or hateful their language may be. We can see this in the unfortunate example of Safiyyaah Nawaz, who on January 1, 2014, tweeted that “this beautiful earth is now 2014 years old, amazing.” Whether it was a joke or simple ignorance didn’t seem to matter: her tweet was then re-tweeted countless times, far and wide. At first, people were confused, but they eventually turned aggressive, reaching a point where comments became hateful and rude. One user even suggested Nawaz commit suicide, writing: “Kill yourself you stupid motherfuck.” Of course, hateful behavior is not exclusive to the internet. We’ve been berating and humiliating each other for as long as humans have been on earth. Even the most ancient polytheistic religions, from Norse to Egyptian to Greek, all have gods dedicated to the dark art of gossip. Even some of the Bible’s most famous verses deal with gossip, such as: “judge not lest you be judged.” Negativity and hate is inherent in humanity, and social media of all forms – Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter and so on – stands as a testament to that. You’ve seen how nasty we can be when we’re anonymous. But how do people choose to represent themselves when their data is more easily available? How do you choose to label yourself? By ethnicity, gender or perhaps age? Interestingly, the vocabulary you use is often enough to identify you as belonging to one group or another. People tend to use words that specifically relate to their ethnic, sexual and political identity. For instance, if you were to map out the most common words found on OkCupid, the results draw an interesting yet stereotypical caricature of different social groups. For example, words and phrases such as “my blue eyes,” “campfire” and “Allman Brothers” are the most common phrases found in the profiles of white men. Black men often use the words “dreads,” “Jamie Foxx” and “Paid in Full.” Asian women write “Taiwan,” “tall for an Asian” and “filipina” more often, and Latinas write “una,” “merengue bachata” and “Colombian” the most. In essence, OkCupid users represented their own cultural backgrounds without ever making explicit reference to that background. As it turns out, ethnic and cultural backgrounds are not the only things that can be distinguished by language alone. Gender, that is, the characteristics that distinguish masculinity and femininity, is equally (if not more) represented by our choice of vocabulary. If you look at the phrase commonality of men and women on Twitter, you’ll find some predictable phrases that clearly distinguish one group from the other. The most common phrases for women include: “my nails done,” “cute texts,” “girls night” and “my makeup.” Men, on the other hand, write “good bro,” “ps4,” “the squad” and “hoopin.” However, essential vocabulary like “the” and “pizza” transcend racial and gender boundaries. So perhaps we aren’t so different after all! With a growing degree of openness and sharing online, the issue of privacy is a hot topic and will remain so for some time. A good starting point is to ask: How much privacy do we even have when online? In essence, we have significant control over our privacy if we choose what and how much we share on social media. If you choose to limit your social media usage, then you’ll enjoy greater privacy. It’s harder for internet megacorporations to collect your online data if you aren’t constantly sharing photos or allowing social networking sites to publish when or where you’re traveling. However, privacy comes at a cost. The services we enjoy, such as Google and Facebook, are free only because these companies have access to and can sell the data we share. Basically, we barter away our private information for the chance to get free information from Google or to effortlessly connect with old friends on Facebook. But what happens if you are a social media user, yet decide you no longer want to be? What should happen to your data? Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Alex Pentland believes that we should have a New Deal on Data which would give us greater control of how our data is used online. One aspect of this New Deal would entail the ability to remove your data from a website whenever you feel like it is or might be misused. It would also mean being able to take your data with you. You should have private access to the personal data collected on you, so you could then sell that data to scientists on your own if you so choose. In the end, however, you can only have as much privacy as you allow yourself. The key message in this book: The massive amounts of data collected by internet services offers scientists and researchers entirely new information that they can then use to investigate the human condition. While the results aren’t always flattering, the data helps us nevertheless better understand our behavior when online. Suggested further reading: Big Data by Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and Kenneth Cukier Big Data provides an insightful look at why a change to “big data” is a major shift in how we collect, use and think about the data around us. It provides great explanations and examples of how individuals and companies already ahead of the curve are using the tools of big data to create value and profit. Casting an eye forward, the book also outlines the future implications for a big-data society in terms of the risks, opportunities and legal implications.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

The last fifty years have been marked by an information revolution that’s become so ingrained in our daily lives that it’s easy to forget just how groundbreaking it is. Garry Kasparov makes an astounding argument for reflecting upon our changing times. He leads us through the kinds of questions we should be asking of technology and what we might expect of this rapidly evolving world. It’s a job he’s well qualified to do. As one of history’s greatest ever chess players, he was pitted against a team of computer scientists and their cutting-edge technology. Could their machines beat him? Kasparov’s sparring with IBM’s Deep Blue in the late 1990s settled that question. What’s more, the mechanics of chess and of artificial intelligence have a lot in common. So when you think about it, you can learn a lot about the workings of the modern technological world through the cultural story of chess. Let Kasparov take you on a journey through the history and the future of artificial intelligence, chess and computers. In these blinks you’ll learn why computer technicians aren’t to be trusted; which lunchbox item caused a fracas at the 1978 World Chess Championship; and the basic programming principles behind Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Chess is an ancient game, and it’s had a place in Western culture for centuries. But while it's admired by most people, it’s often from a safe distance. That’s probably down to the fact that chess has a certain reputation it just can’t shake. In the West, chess is seen as a game for nerds. Typically, chess obsessives are thought of as having no life outside the 64 squares of the chess board. The author, Garry Kasparov, has gone out of his way to challenge such prejudices. However, despite all the interviews he has given where he speaks about politics and history, the media have continued to depict him and other chess players as eccentric oddballs. But actually, they are just ordinary folks with a special talent. It’s hard to shift long-held cultural beliefs; chess players still linger at the bottom of any school social hierarchy. But there are signs of gradual improvement the US, thanks to the introduction of school chess programs. Young children are discovering, without prejudice, that chess can actually be fun. The American view of chess stands in great contrast to the situation in Russia. There, chess has long been revered. When Kasparov was growing up, Russia was still part of the Soviet Union. Chess was widely played and extensively promoted. Consequently, it never had the unflattering associations it had in the West. Rather, it had much the same status as any other popular sport, like baseball in the US. In fact, the tradition of holding chess players and teachers in high regard goes back to Tsarist times. Even though many aristocrats were killed during the Russian Revolution, the aristocratic tradition of playing chess did not die out. Instead, the Communists cultivated and encouraged it. They even went so far as to exempt elite chess players from military service in the ongoing Russian civil war so they could participate in Soviet chess championships. As computational science took its first tentative steps in the 1950s, few people suspected where this new technology would lead. Predictions of utopian and dystopian futures controlled by computers were common. But it was all a bit far-fetched when you consider that the first personal computers came nowhere close to being able to play chess. Scientists did try though. In 1956, a laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico developed the first chess-playing computer. The machine was called MANIAC 1, and it was one of the very first computers that had enough memory to store a chess program. It weighed about 1000 pounds. That said, the computer’s capacity was still limited. The scientists had to use a reduced board of 36 squares, which involved doing away with the bishops. The computer ended up losing to an experienced player, even though they had made him play without a queen. However, that same year, the computer managed to beat a chess novice. It was the first time in history that artificial intelligence had defeated a human in an intellectual game. Before too long, computers were powerful enough to challenge grandmasters. The speed of improvement is largely explained by Moore’s law, which states that computers' processing speeds invariably double every two years. By 1977, computers could compete with the top 5% of human players. They tended to make occasional game-losing errors, but their overall strong defensive and tactical moves often countered this failing. Additionally, a new algorithm, refined by computer scientists during the 1970s, made the world of difference. It was called alpha-beta and it allowed the computers to automatically reject any move that was less effective than the one being considered at that moment, narrowing the number of moves it had to evaluate. As a result, computers became faster at calculating possible moves, and even had capacity to ‘think' several moves ahead. It’s not hard to imagine that the profession of supermarket cashier will soon be a thing of the past. After all, self-checkout machines are firmly establishing their place in supermarkets. This example is indicative of a broader trend. Computers are putting humans out of work, especially those with jobs in the service industry. Debates that pit humans against machines go back to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, when agricultural and manufacturing equipment started to replace human laborers. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, precisely engineered machines effectively made skilled laborers – such as watchmakers or laboratory assistants – obsolete. Finally, the Information Revolution came riding in on the back of the advent of the internet. At a stroke, millions of service and support jobs were wiped out; employees such as bank tellers and travel agents found themselves largely replaced by online e-services. It is surely a matter of time before machines start to nullify even the most prestigious professions. Yes, even doctors and lawyers. All that said, there’s no need to get sentimental over the fact that machines can now shoulder human toil. Technological progress has historically been a good thing. Human civilization has developed in large part because we’ve used our inventions to reduce the need for human labor. As a result, we’ve seen increases in the quality of life and the advancement of human rights. It is truly a sign of our privilege that we can live in air-conditioned rooms, flick through devices that give us access to all of humankind’s knowledge and still complain that manual labor is being eradicated. This just means we have to learn to adapt. It’s clear that things aren’t going back to the way they once were. Clerks, cashiers and call-center employees whose work has been replaced by artificial intelligence will not return to manufacturing jobs, for example. Instead, they will have to be directed towards new types of technological and service jobs as they emerge. In September 2016, Kasparov visited a robotics event in Oxford where he was able to chat directly with a robot called Artie. Such talking robots may still seem pretty futuristic, but they are sure to become an essential aspect of daily life very soon as developments in artificial intelligence continue. It’s long been held true that computers can come up with solutions, but unlike humans, they can’t formulate questions. But that’s no longer the case. Computers can already ask questions, but they can’t, as yet, know which questions are the important ones. Any device can ask you a question that’s been coded into it. It just needs a prompt and an automated response that goes with it, in this case in the form of a question. That’s how devices like Google Assistant, or Amazon’s Alexa work. However, even if the interaction seems authentic, it’s actually just based on very basic data analysis. Scientists are now trying to see whether machines can formulate their own questions directly from the data they’ve harvested. They’ll no longer need a set of human prompts for triggering automated response-questions. Machines may one day even advance beyond that. As artificial intelligence develops, they may surprise us not only with the data they produce but also by their methods. Let’s look at how that might work in chess. Until recently, chess computers had chess strategies directly programmed into them. They knew that a queen was worth more than a rook, for example, because this knowledge was coded into the program. But now, researchers are trying to develop chess computers by just programming them with the most basic chess rules. After that, they’re meant to work out everything else by themselves, meaning they can come up with completely novel strategies and plays which they could also teach humans. It’s an ongoing debate as to whether chess should be considered a sport or not. What is certain, however, is that the nervous exhaustion experienced after a chess match is on a par with exhaustion felt at the end of a track race. This is due to the fact that chess is ultimately a psychological game. Since 2003, Kasparov has been studying chess matches played by famous grandmasters, including his own. He laid out his discoveries in his book My Great Predecessors and argued that even the best chess players make many tactical mistakes. Of course, it’s not because they don’t know any better. It’s due to the fact they're anxious or psychologically worn down by their opponents. The German chess player Emanuel Lasker, who was World Chess Champion for 27 years between 1894 and 1921, epitomized the psychological approach to chess. The idea was that the best move need not necessarily make the most sense tactically, but that it should make an opponent as uncomfortable as possible. This style of play requires careful analysis of an opponent's game before a match begins. Weaknesses must be identified, as well as the moves most likely to psychologically destabilize him or her. No such rules apply when computers play chess. A human will always have a psychological reaction to the stress of a match. But computers are emotionless, both in and out of chess games. For them, it’s purely a question of strategy. By 1985, computers were already powerful enough to compute every possible combination of moves over the next three or four turns and pick the most appropriate one. But, if the player was able to strategize at least five moves ahead, it was quite possible for him to defeat a computer. It’s a commonly held belief that success rests upon innate talent. But, as Malcolm Gladwell wrote in Outliers, this is debatable. What matters is many thousands of hours of practice. For humans, Gladwell’s thesis holds some truth. But as far as artificial intelligence is concerned, there’s no uncertainty. Brute force is what counts. Donald Michie, a British researcher in the field of artificial intelligence and machine-learning pioneer, was among the first to really take advantage of this when he began pairing computers with large amounts of raw data. He tested the concept in the game of tic-tac-toe in 1960. Normally, you might give a computer a series of rules to apply in a game. But Michie gave the computer numerous examples of game moves and allowed it to work out basic principles from there. We actually see this sort of machine learning process all the time with modern translation programs such as Google Translate. They don’t actually know much at all about the languages. Instead, they've just been fed millions of example sentences with corresponding translations, created by people. Based on these, they’re able to piece together a reasonable translation of any given text. Such systems are not infallible, however. Computers that rely of huge amounts of data can also make massive errors. In the 1980s, Michie tried to create a chess-playing machine. He and some other researchers stuffed the computer with raw data: millions of chess moves played during grandmaster games. The computer became a great player, but one that would occasionally do baffling things, like suddenly sacrifice its queen for no apparent reason. What had happened was that the computer had learned from the grandmasters that sacrificing the queen could be a move that signaled victory. But of course, the computer had failed to recognize that the gambit only worked when many other parameters were in place. It was as if it understood everything, but simultaneously nothing at all. For many people, a game is just a game and nothing more. But there are also those who burst into tears or see red if they lose. The author, in his chess-playing days, was hardly a blubberer, but he wasn’t exactly a happy loser either. When he lost a chess match, he sometimes suffered sleepless nights for days after. Sometimes, he'd even throw tantrums at award ceremonies if he didn’t take home the winner’s trophy. And Kasparov isn't ashamed of this behavior. As far as he’s concerned, to be a good competitor, your dislike of losing has to be greater than your fear of competing. Otherwise, you'll just quit. Thankfully, the author didn’t need to face losses often. Of the 2400 career matches he played, he only lost 170 times. But those games were against humans. Playing computers was another story entirely. Kasparov lost a game to a computer for the first time in May 1994, in Munich. Its name was Fritz 3. Kasparov played well at first and achieved an advantageous position. But then, he made just one strategically unsound move. Immediately, the computer was back in the game. The mistake was understandable. It was a blitz chess tournament, a format where players often take mere seconds to mull over every move. Although Kasparov ultimately won the whole tournament, it was the first time that a computer had managed to defeat a chess world champion. Kasparov went on to face an even more powerful computer – IBM’s Deep Blue – under tournament conditions a few years later in 1996. This time it was a full match over 6 games. Kasparov won the first match, but at the rematch the following year, Deep Blue was the victor. It was a close match, but in the end, Deep Blue could calculate so many possible options for each move that Kasparov couldn’t keep up. It marked a major victory for artificial intelligence. It was a moment of realization for Kasparov. He could now be regularly beaten by computers, and they were sure to get only more powerful in the future. And with that, Kasparov resigned himself to the experience of losing. As spectators, we generally see the glamorous sides of competitive sports. But behind the scenes, in the shadows, foul play is hardly unusual. Competitive chess is no different. From a distance, these anecdotes can appear quite amusing. Take the bitter rivalry of Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi, the two dominant players in the 1970s. At the 1978 World Championships in the Philippines, Karpov hired a psychologist called Dr. Zhukar to stare intently at Korchnoi throughout the match, in an attempt to hypnotize or distract him. Korchnoi refused to be outdone. During the same championship, he recruited some Indian sect members to meditate and stare at Karpov and his psychologist, in an attempt to intimidate them. What’s more, each of them constantly accused the other of cheating and would demand to have various objects the other possessed investigated. These included Korchnoi’s chair and glasses, and, famously, Karpov’s yogurt. These days, computers haven’t eliminated the existence of foul play, it just exists in a different form. For instance, a certain amount of human intervention on the computers is allowed during matches. Technicians sort out bugs, restart computers if they crash and adjust computers' evaluative functions between games. At the time of Kasparov’s famous rematch with Deep Blue in 1997, these routine modifications were already accepted. In fact, Deep Blue crashed twice during the six games and was restarted on both occasions. Because the restarts erased the computer’s memory tables, it would have led it to make different moves and decisions than it would have had it not crashed. Illicit triggering of this kind of event during matches could be a way for technicians to give computers an unfair advantage. As a consequence, technicians' interventions are now more firmly regulated. Chess is a complex and beautiful game, but it ultimately proved simple enough for computers to master. That much was in evidence when Deep Blue beat the author, using just the processing power available in the late 1990s. The next challenge for computer science will be to get computers to master more complex board games with many more squares and variables than chess. Something like the Chinese game Go will do just nicely. The key message in these blinks: Artificial intelligence is fast surpassing human intelligence. It has had the capability to beat world class chess players at the game for over 20 years, but much more is to be expected. For the time being, computers are mainly using brute computing force and their abilities to process huge amounts of data in order to do this. But a new revolution in artificial intelligence is in the offing. If computers can start to analyze the data, to formulate questions from it, and to develop solutions independently of human input, then we will have truly entered a new era. Got feedback?

Once a popular and profitable retailer, Blockbuster ended up at rock bottom when the traditional DVD rental model collapsed. It’s a sad tale and a warning to others. No business owner wants to be the next Blockbuster.  Blockbuster is just one example of a business that failed to stay ahead of the curve. These blinks offer a lot of advice to help today’s businesses avoid a similar fate. As they point out, we’re currently in the middle of the digital era. Businesses which fail to adapt to this digital age will be left behind. This includes all those businesses which merely pay lip service to the digital world, without fully embracing it. Digital Darwinism requires you to integrate the digital era into the DNA of your business, not just to add a website with a virtual tour of your business. It’s only a matter of time before digital technology becomes like electricity and is a seamless part of our daily lives. So this is what tomorrow’s leading businesses will need to embrace. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you don’t want to be like Heathrow Airport; why the traditional understanding of disruption is all wrong; and why adding a chat bot to your business won’t get you very far. We often think in terms of “survival of the fittest.” But what does that mean for businesses today, when rapid global change is an ongoing concern? You may think that the most successful companies will always be the massive ones with teams of experts and billions to spend. But, as the author sees it, darwinism in the digital age is about being able to flourish by taking advantage of that rapid global change – it’s about being able to adapt quickly to whatever the uncertain future may bring. Big businesses with a global reach that have been around for 30 to 50 years are no longer the most successful companies out there. In fact, these businesses may be at a disadvantage. After all, they can easily end up so stuck in their ways that they find it difficult to make any changes at all.  For example, Sony invested greatly in making devices such as the Walkman and Discman to play music on cassettes or CDs. This helped them become the market leaders. And then MP3 and digital music happened. Sony could have moved into this new, and potentially very lucrative market. But if this digital music really took off, what would happen to all the Walkmans and Discmans? They’d be outdated. They wouldn’t sell. So, Sony saw the move to digital as a very risky act of self-disruption. As a result, the company was hesitant to move in the new market and it lost its leading position to more disruptive rivals. Instead, too many businesses are only willing to make small gestures toward embracing new technologies. The author refers to this as a “bolted-on” approach. An example of this is when a bank creates an app that allows a check to be deposited by snapping a photo of it, rather than rethinking the need for using paper checks in this day and age. They’re simply wedging technology into a dying system. A good analogy is Heathrow Airport, London. Bucket-loads of money have been spent trying to update Heathrow, despite the fact that it’s located in an area that makes it difficult for planes to maneuver and will be an unwieldy mess no matter how many alterations are made. At some point, a new airport will be built with room to grow in a practical location using modern technology at its very core. In other words, simply trying to update a burdensome, outdated system is unsustainable.  For legacy businesses, it’s essentially the same situation. Instead of tweaking an ailing system, you must be willing to make fundamental changes in order to truly adapt. If there’s one thing for certain, it’s that the future is uncertain. Sure, there are a lot of people willing to sound foolish by trying to predict the future, but no one can be truly certain of what lies ahead. That said, we can look to the past and learn a lot about what to expect in the years ahead. If we look back over our recent history, we can recognize three important eras that demonstrate a pattern in how businesses respond to new technology. By looking at the advent of electricity and computers, we can see that we’re in the middle of a very similar era regarding the internet. In each of these eras, people were, on the whole, reluctant to embrace a new technology and fully incorporate it into society. Time and time again, people applied the technology to their traditional ways of doing things. Old and new would bump up against each other in chaotic ways until, inevitably, the new technology became accepted, fully integrated and so commonplace in everyday life that it was practically seamless. This happened with electricity, but it took a long time. Starting in the 1830s, when its potential for businesses and homes was first presented, it took around 100 years for electricity to become commonplace. For a long time, there was no standardization and factories that had relied on steam power were hesitant to change their ways.  It also took a long time for electricity to be used for truly innovative purposes. For the most part, companies spent decades simply making electrified versions of machines and appliances that already existed. It took an age for companies to learn that they didn’t need updated factories; they needed new, electricity-focused factories. A similar process happened with computers and digital technology, though in both cases the time it took from introduction to mass acceptance took half as long as before. For computers, there was a 50-year mid-period between arrival and full acceptance. In this period, cautious businesses tried to computerize just a few processes while holding on to as many of their traditional processes as possible. Some of the conflict of the computer era was resolved with the introduction of the digital era, which included the internet. PCs and Macs, which had been incompatible, were now able to connect with one another over the internet. But once again, we find ourselves with many businesses just applying modern technology on the fringes of their business.  Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School academic, described disruption in the business world as a new company that comes along with a new technology and a lower price to undermine the legacy companies. But this description doesn’t quite fit.    When you think of some of the biggest disruptors in recent years, like Uber or Airbnb, you can see that these businesses didn’t have a lower price and nor did they just bring along some new technology. After all, Airbnb customers might spend more than they would for a traditional hotel. What disruptors really do is completely rethink the way of doing things, be it running a car service or operating in the hospitality industry. In other words, they shift the paradigm and fundamentally change how people do things. In order to truly disrupt an industry you have to do more than bolt-on some new technology and offer a cheaper price – you have to go beyond the outer layers of your business and have bold innovation at the core of your being. The outer layers of a business include how you communicate with your customers, your marketing efforts, what your product or service is and how your business functions. Most businesses have added technology to these layers, such as using emailed newsletters and Instagram accounts as marketing tools. Few have put technology and truly innovative ways of doing business at their core. Take the car rental company Hertz, for example. It’s made it possible for you to send a recorded video of your customer complaint, rather than having to fill out an online form. It’s using technology as a tool while remaining committed to its traditional car rental business plan. If Hertz were to really embrace the digital age, it would change that core business plan to resemble something similar to how Zipcar, the rental service, operates, and make the entire process app-based. One of the keys to coming up with an innovative plan is to think of ideas that aren’t boxed in by the assumed parameters of your industry. Companies like Uber and Airbnb removed the assumed parameter that a company had to own physical assets, like cars and rooms, in order to connect customers with a ride from point A to point B or a room to stay in during their vacation.  When your idea finds a solution that changes those parameters, you may be on your way to shifting the paradigm and causing real disruption. You don’t necessarily have to be a new business in order to disrupt your industry. In fact, there are essentially four ways for any established business to change and be innovative. The first is self-disruption, which means investing in a technology or way of doing things that would, if successful, make your current process obsolete. This is also referred to as “cannibalism” in the business world and, while it can be risky and difficult, it can also pay off big time. Just think of how Netflix pulled off a remarkable act of self-disruption when it shifted its focus from DVD rentals to streaming. In 2007, after investing $40 million dollars in new data storage, Netflix allowed existing members to stream a limited number of hours of content at no extra cost, while their library of streamable content steadily grew. Then, in 2011, Netflix made the subscription plans for renting DVDs and streaming content separate. Not only that, they made the streaming plan cheaper and moved the DVD plan to a service called Qwikster. Within months, stock prices plummeted from $42 a share to below $10, and Wall Street was calling for CEO Reed Hastings to step down. But Netflix knew streaming was the way of the future. After weathering the initial storm, it became apparent that a lot of new subscribers were attracted to the lower subscription fee, and the library of content continued to expand. Now those shares are selling at over $100. This leads us to the second way of changing: continual reinvention. Instead of making a rigid and inflexible operation plan, make having room to adapt an essential and fundamental part of your business. Think of how Facebook naturally evolved from a place to reconnect with an old friend to being the most powerful media company in the world. It’s no coincidence that Facebook spends millions every year on research and development. The last two ways to cultivate change are making measured and hedged bets. A measured bet is like BMW making a relatively small number of electric vehicles in their BMWi series. BMW don’t count on these cars to be its main source of profit, but the venture allows it to develop new technology. Maybe one day BMWi technology will be used to improve the company’s other car models. Hedging is what companies like Google, Dell, Cisco and Intel do when they invest in other businesses that may develop cutting edge ideas that could be beneficial for them. This is the whole idea behind Google Ventures, or why a plastics and chemical manufacturer like DuPont invested in General Motors when the car manufacturer was just getting off the ground in 1914. Just as it was clear that streaming video was the way of the future over a decade ago, we can also make some safe assumptions about the future growth of other emerging digital technologies. When exploring what the next big thing will be, it helps to try and see one or two steps down the road. For instance, when smartphones emerged, the real innovative minds looked to the further implications of this technology, like the apps and emojis and all the different secondary business opportunities that the smartphone would unleash. One area that is being explored today is known as the Internet of Things. This is what people are calling the advent of the 5G internet service. 5G will make it possible for more and more devices to be connected to each other in real time. This is not only about being able to process more data than ever before, it’s also about allowing seamless transactions to take place. An early example of what the Internet of Things will look like is the digital thermostats being made by Nest. The Nest thermostat makes it easy to program the heating and air-conditioning in your home. It shows us that it’s just a matter of time before you can have your home’s temperature, lighting and background music ready for you when you walk in the door. The Nest thermometer is the kind of forward thinking that more businesses should be moving toward, as it’s making digital technology a seamless part of modern living. This is exactly what happened with electricity and computers. Tomorrow’s leading businesses will be the ones making this seamless interaction happen in digitally connected homes. You could also look at facial recognition technology as an example. Soon, your face could be just as valid a form of ID as your passport. So the idea of being able to travel without a paper passport, or being able to pay by doing nothing more than showing your face, is very much a possibility. Is it that hard to imagine your bank account and travel permissions being linked to one paperless source of ID? Of course, facial recognition technology and other possible aspects of the Internet of Things lead to questions about privacy and data security, which is why businesses need to focus on being secure and transparent about how they treat people’s data. From what we can already see, it’s very likely that the benefits of a seamless digitally assisted life will, for most people, outweigh these concerns. Therefore, it’s up to future companies to give people security as well as great value in return for their data. One of the reasons Amazon’s one-button-purchase option is so impressive is that it understands the difference between shopping and buying. While businesses can try to make shopping a memorable experience, more forward-thinking businesses should consider what Amazon has done and make the buying experience as quick, painless and unmemorable as possible.  If a buying experience is memorable, it’s usually because it was a bad experience. A good buying experience is effortless and easy, like taking care of the entire process with one push of a button. The world is still filled with digital disappointments, like businesses not accepting your preferred online payment method or not being able to stream your favorite BBC show outside the United Kingdom. Basically, the only time we really pay attention to technology these days is when it isn’t working. The leaders of tomorrow will be the businesses that make things like buying products and streaming content easy, no matter where you are. Ultimately, making things seamless and easy isn’t about knowing which technology is the most cutting edge. It’s about empathy and knowing what people want and how to make it simpler for them to achieve that goal. So forget about buzzwords like “interactive” and “digital” and think about the tools that people are already using and how to make those tools more connected. We can see that the digital era is moving us toward a hybrid world, where bluetooth speakers are also portals that can help us buy things or access information. Soon enough, there will be no regional restrictions to content and things like national currency will be less of a concern. It’s time to think across all boundaries and how we can help people everywhere have better, more frictionless experiences with the technology that is already making its way into every part of our lives. For one last example: a lot of people are pointing at AI, or artificial intelligence, as one of the big technologies of the future, and that will likely be the case. But how many businesses are just bolting a chat bot onto their website as a way of saying, hey, we use AI?  The real innovative and disruptive companies will be the ones that use this kind of technology to do new transformative things. They’ll always have the latest tech at the core of their business plan as a tool for helping people in innovative ways. The key message in these blinks: Digital darwinism isn’t about being the strongest or wealthiest business. It’s about being agile and capable of quickly adapting to the changing global marketplace. Companies can stay ahead of the pack by putting innovation and a willingness to change at the core of their business plan. They can also concentrate on looking beyond accepted parameters toward new ways of doing things and helping people to live in the digital era in a more seamless way.  Actionable advice: Create new forms of value. Often, when visiting his parents, the author is willing to take a slower train ride because it offers reliable wi-fi and plenty of places to plug in his devices. By providing these services, the train line created a new form of value by embracing the digital age. In other ways, businesses can create value by saving the customer time and effort, whether it’s a bank that stores all of a customer’s receipts digitally or an app that lets you skip the long checkout line at a store. So start thinking about how your business can create new forms of value for customers by being more integrated with the digital era and your customers’ needs.    Got feedback?

Darwinism is about more than just “survival of the fittest,” and there’s no better way to understand the principles of adaptation and evolution than to go to the source and discover the ideas of Charles Darwin himself.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

So, who wouldn’t want to live forever? Or at least double one’s lifespan? Most people would. Drawing from his own intense wish to end aging – and his scientific knowledge – the author provides a thorough introduction to the seven-step program that he has developed as a means against aging. In these blinks, you’ll discover why free radicals should be avoided if you want to live longer; why graves aren’t glowing in the dark; and how to eliminate cancer. As the saying goes, two things are unavoidable in life: death and taxes. While it’s true that there isn’t much we can do to keep the government from taking a chunk out of our paycheck, we are becoming better at delaying death. We’ve long accepted aging as an unavoidable, though unpleasant, fact of life. Most people don’t think there’s much sense in worrying about something we have no control over. Why waste time trying to prevent the inevitable? After all, how can you enjoy life if you’re worrying about an unsolvable problem? There are also those who believe that solving the problem of aging could be a bad thing; there are concerns that such a solution would contribute to overpopulation, or that the solution would only be available to the extremely wealthy. But there are many – the author among them – who believe it is worth regarding the problem of aging as potentially soluble, just like any other ailment. That’s why the author has developed a program that aims to stop aging. This program is called SENS: Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence. In the upcoming blinks, we’ll see how this strategy could help prevent mitochondrial mutations by clearing up the junk that plagues human cells. This junk includes disease-promoting proteins called AGEs and death-resistant “zombie cells.” We’ll also see how these steps can promote healthy cell loss as well as prevent DNA mutation, which leads to aging. The author’s program does face some challenges, however: there are concerns about insufficient funding to properly develop the technology and conduct the research that is needed to stop people from aging. But if funding does come through, he predicts – with a 50 percent certainty – that it will be possible for us to stop people from dying of old age. Most scientists agree that aging is inevitable. However, the bodily damage that causes aging may be reparable. When we’re presented with a problem, there are generally two paths to explore when looking for a solution: prevention or cure. In the field of medicine, most problems are solved by offering a cure rather than prevention. This approach, however, has major drawbacks. For example, if someone has heart disease or diabetes, they can obtain medication to help cure their ailments without ever finding out what caused the problem in the first place. But prevention isn’t all that straightforward, either. If you want to prevent an ailment, you need to pinpoint its cause. This can be quite complicated; all too often, there are many factors, each contributing to the main problem. And this is the problem with preventing aging: there are so many influences, from cell damage to food consumption, that cause the body to age. So, if prevention is uncertain, and a cure is only a theoretical possibility, the next best thing to focus on is repair. We can see the benefits of this approach by considering the treatment of a 40-year-old. First, how would prevention work? In this scenario, let’s say we could cut the speed of aging in half. That means our 40-year-old, expected to live to the age of 80, would live an additional 40 years and reach 120 years of age. Although this doubles the remaining lifespan, the total lifespan only increases by 33 percent. Now, let’s look at the other scenario: repair. We could cut the accumulated damage of a 40-year-old in half, providing a therapeutic treatment he could follow for the rest of his life. So, by the age of 80, he may have only accumulated the damage of a 50-year-old. Following this treatment, we could increase his remaining lifespan by four or five times, approximately doubling the total lifespan. Instead of 80 years, he’d live 160. As we’ll see, repairing the damage in one’s body is exactly what the author proposes, and it all starts with fixing mitochondrial mutation. So, what exactly are mitochondria? They’re commonly referred to as the “power plants of the cells,” because they produce the energy we need to live. But you only need to learn a little about power plants to know that energy production usually comes with nasty side effects. In our bodies, one of these is free radicals. If you’ve ever heard of free radicals, you probably know that they are bad for our health. But what you may not know is that most free radicals are actually produced within our own cells. In fact, free radicals are molecules that are based on oxygen but missing one electron. Having the right amount of electrons would result in a stable substance, but as soon as one is missing, the molecule becomes highly reactive. A free radical stays reactive until it finds a new electron, which it usually pulls from the nearest stable molecule, leading to a chain reaction. Although free radicals can be the result of pollutants or toxins that come from your diet, the majority are actually produced in your mitochondria. They are harmful because these chain reactions result in mutations and damage in your mitochondrial DNA, which contributes to aging. So, how do we stop this damage from happening? Well, many solutions have been proposed, the most promising of which is allotopic expression. Allotopic expression is a form of gene therapy that involves keeping a backup of our mitochondrial DNA in the protective nucleus of our cells, protecting our genes from the constant exposure to free radicals. And since less than one percent of our cells are influenced by genetic mutation, the likelihood that that stored gene would already contain a mutation is low. So, there’s one possible solution to the problem of mitochondrial damage. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at the junk – both in and outside of our cells – that is another contributor to aging. Just like a household, cells produce waste. And although cells recycle this waste in a better and more efficient way than most households, there is still leftover junk that can cause damage. Part of this waste product is called lipofuscin, which the cells recycle via lysosomes. Unfortunately, lipofuscin is something that can’t be properly disposed of. Lysosomes are unable to get rid of all the lipofuscin that accumulates in the cells, which leads to aging and diseases such as arteriosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in arteries. One possible solution to this problem is as crazy as it is simple, and it can be found in our graveyards. Since lipofuscin accumulates right up until death, graveyards must be full of it. Furthermore, lipofuscin is fluorescent, but since we don’t tend to see anything glowing in the dark in our graveyards, there must be something that is breaking lipofuscin down. And there is: microbes. Microbes in the soil break down the lipofuscin into a usable material, and although there are hurdles to overcome, introducing these same microbes into the body could be a way to process the junk inside our cells that cause aging. But along with the junk inside our cells, there is junk accumulating outside of our cells called amyloids, most of which consist of damaged proteins. As we age, these amyloids can accumulate in cells around the brain, leading to Alzheimer’s disease. The author also has a suggestion for getting rid of this outside junk: vaccination. There’s evidence that our brain’s immune system can get rid of amyloids, but it does so at a very slow pace. A vaccination could increase the speed of this process by stopping the accumulation of junk outside of our cells and slowing down the rate at which the brain ages. But there’s more to repairing our bodies than just clearing out the junk. In the next blink, we’ll learn about other ways we could keep our bodies young. A central cause of aging is the gradual loss of cells. So it only makes sense that creating new ones would be a great way to fix this problem. And while there is a way to do this, politics and questions of morality are standing in the way. For instance, one method involves stem cells. While we all contain adult stem cells, only embryonic stems cells can be used to produce new cells in our body. In fact, embryonic stem cells can be turned into any cell, including heart, lung and muscle cells. The problem is that embryonic stem cells are only available in early-stage embryos. Therefore, these methods are being hotly debated, especially in the United States. Most of this debate revolves around the moral question of when life begins and whether it is appropriate to medically use embryos. But one thing everyone can agree on is that aging comes with many concerns – cancer chief among them, which begins when our DNA mutates with age. The DNA contained in a cell’s nucleus is like a blueprint for our entire biological design. But this can get damaged through UV rays, free radicals or other environmental toxins, leading to our DNA providing flawed and cancerous instructions. These flaws can be replicated when cells divide, causing the cancer to spread. So one possible solution to eliminating cancer is to get rid of the telomerase gene. A telomere is a protective cap that sits on each end of a chromosome; when the cell naturally divides, the caps become shortened. However, the telomerase gene re-lengthens these caps, preventing them from becoming too short and, therefore, being able to die. Since cancer is caused by the uncontrolled replication of cells, the removal of the telomerase gene could prevent this re-lengthening process from happening, which would allow dangerous cells to simply die off after enough divisions. Deleting telomerase would put an expiration date on all of our body’s cells, but this problem could be solved through stem cell therapy. If you’ve ever eaten meat that has been browned or blackened, then chances are you’ve eaten advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) as well. But even if you haven’t, the same process that blackened the meat is also happening naturally in your body. AGEs are the result of a complex chemical process where sugars and other substances bind to proteins. These AGEs accumulate in your cells, decreasing their functionality, and can lead to disease and early death. Several tests and studies have shown that there is no way to prevent the build-up of AGEs, so the author suggests using a drug to clear them out after they’ve built up. One such drug, alagebrium, has shown positive results in animal tests. Unfortunately for humans, however, the benefits of the drug don’t outweigh the negative side effects. The author hopes that, in the future, scientists will discover and create more drugs designed to break up AGEs. As we get older, we also accumulate more “death-resistant” cells, called “zombie cells.” Our body can shut down most of our cells in order to prevent disease and cancer. But zombie cells don’t remain “dead,” they continue to cause problems, becoming toxic, damaging the surrounding cells and thereby aging us. One possible way to eliminate these zombie cells is to stop them from dying in the first place. It might seem counter-intuitive, but we could do this by using telomerase to lengthen their telomeres, keeping them alive. This has been achieved in lab trials; however, this method always carries the risk of causing cancer, as we saw in the previous blink. Another method for getting rid of zombie cells is to use gene therapy to create a suicide gene that targets and destroys the cell. As we’ll see in the next blink, many of these therapies come with risks, but that doesn’t mean they’re not worth taking. As we’ve seen, many of the first steps toward fighting aging have already been taken. But despite this fact, those at work on this issue are still in the minority. This is why the author has come up with a plan to convince the majority. It’s called the robust mouse rejuvenation (RMR). The author will use his proposed techniques on 20 mice of the species Mus musculus. He expects to find successful results after treating the mice and expanding their lifespan from an average of three years to an average of five years. He also plans to start the treatment when the mice are at least two years of age – when they’ll have already accumulated the damage that comes from having lived over half their expected lifespan. The author also hopes that by declaring war on aging, we can learn to accept the possible deaths that come with such advancements. We’ve seen this happen before. For example, in 1999, a teenager undergoing gene therapy died of anaphylactic shock. This incident put gene therapy in a bad light, resulting in a year-long suspension of trails which set progress back and likely caused more deaths. The author suggests that delays such as this, as well as the slow approval of drugs, do little to prevent casualties. In fact, the author believes that the current ratio of lives lost while awaiting drug approvals outweighs the lives lost through unapproved drugs by ten to one. Hopefully, after the success of RMR, drugs will be quickly approved in order prevent more time being wasted, and more needless aging from occurring. It’s always possible that people could die as a result of treatment. The author hopes that shifting the aforementioned ratio to two to one will convince people that progress is being made, and help them accept the change. It is possible: in a few decades from now, aging, which was considered unavoidable for thousands of years, will no longer be an inevitable fact of life. The key message in this book: Aging should no longer be considered inevitable. There are modern technologies and therapies that may allow us to stop the accumulation of damage within our bodies, which is the main contributor to aging. Furthermore, these techniques could also reduce the risk of cancer and several other fatal diseases.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It’s just one of the many cryptocurrencies that’ve been making headlines in recent years. Cryptocurrencies are often touted as the next big thing in finance, but few people really understand how they work. In fact, rather than the currencies themselves, it’s the technology that powers them – known as blockchain technology – that has the truly revolutionary potential. Some people believe that blockchains offer so many benefits that they’ll eventually render banks obsolete. Others think they also represent the future of contracts and secure data storage. And there are still others who see all this technology as nothing but a fad that will eventually implode. After reading these blinks, you’ll have a good idea of what blockchain expert Henning Diedrich thinks, and why it might be still too early to tell where Ethereum will take us. In these blinks, you’ll discover why b-money was just a few years ahead of its time; which country uses as much electricity in a year as one Bitcoin blockchain; and why Ethereum may surpass Bitcoin as the blockchain of choice. In the 1980s, the world entered the computer age, with PCs becoming part of many homes and workplaces. To some people, however, this development was anything but welcome. To them, it seemed to foreshadow the rise of a complete surveillance state, not unlike something out George Orwell’s 1984. So a handful of computer programmers decided to fight back, and their weapon was code. Thus, in the late eighties, the cypherpunk movement began. Their main aim was the protection of people’s privacy in the digital world. One of the founders, the American programmer Eric Hughes, cataloged their goals and intentions in the 1993 book A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto. The cypherpunks wished to see safe, encrypted communication in the digital world; this would allow people to make anonymous transactions. Unlike credit card transactions, where the payer and sender can be identified, cypherpunks desired a digital currency where people could send and receive money without being tracked – not unlike paying with cash at the local corner store. They took the first step toward a private communication system in 1997, by launching the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer (CDR), which was basically an anonymous, decentralized email system. Not long afterward, came the first version of a cryptocurrency, called b-money, whose invention is credited to an individual with the online handle “Wei Dai.” Remarkably, b-money worked similarly to how bitcoin works today: all users of the currency held a copy of the transaction log, so that each payment was posted for all to see and potentially approve or dispute. The big difference between b-money and bitcoin is this: in b-money’s day, there was no decentralized way to maintain the accounts. Nevertheless, other attempts at cryptocurrencies followed, but each died when the dot-com bubble burst around the turn of the century. Nearly a decade of silence followed. And then, in 2008, bitcoin emerged, becoming the world’s first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin’s inventor is known as “Satoshi Nakamoto,” but his real name remains a mystery. However, Nakamoto did make his intentions clear. He wanted to make the concept of a traditional bank – that is, of a central financial institution – obsolete. This is why Bitcoin doesn’t operate on any central registry and why all transactions are made directly between the users. Now that you know how cryptocurrencies were born, let’s look at how they work. If you’ve read about bitcoin, you might have seen the word “blockchain” and wondered, what the heck is that? The simplest way to understand a blockchain is to think of it as a secure and shared database that contains transactions. Blockchains can be used for many purposes, but Bitcoin has become the most well known. For the purpose of this digital currency, the blockchain is used to hold transactional information about how many bitcoins are being transferred between two accounts. So the data would read something like, “Account A transfers 10 bitcoins to account B.” The database is called a blockchain because the data is stored in sections known as blocks, and these blocks are organized in a precise way that basically creates a chain of data. The first block of data is called the genesis block, and each block that follows contains information about the preceding block, thereby linking them together like a chain. However, a more appropriate analogy might be a series of Russian nesting dolls, with each block containing the information from previous blocks inside it. The real defining feature of a blockchain database is that it’s decentralized. This is an important feature for a number of reasons, the most important being that it prevents trickery. Generally speaking, most digital things can be easily duplicated – just consider how easy it is to email someone a JPEG or an MP3. But a digital currency, in order to have real value, needs to be protected against duplication. Blockchain technology overcomes this challenge by decentralizing the database. So if you have five bitcoins, this data isn’t being stored on one central computer; it’s constantly being synchronized over a whole network of computers. If you tried to go in and quickly change your bitcoin amount from five to fifteen, this change would show up on everyone’s copy of the blockchain and anyone can disagree and prevent it from becoming official. The other level of security provided by blockchain is its use of cryptography, which is why the term “cryptocurrency” is used to describe bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital currencies. Cryptography allows for secure communication and secure storage of information and provides added levels of authentication within the blockchain. Every transaction requires a digital signature that uses cryptography to authenticate transactions and ensure that past transactions aren’t tampered with. To get a better understanding of how cryptocurrencies work without the aid of a central banking authority, we need to look at the step-by-step process of a transaction. Blockchains operate through a consensus protocol known as proof-of-work. This protocol ensures that the blockchain always accurately represents every transaction made. This works by having all the individual computers in the network, called nodes, agree on one “true” version of the blockchain. The nodes that actively participate in the consensus-building process are called miners or validators. Obviously, it can be a challenge for all the nodes to agree on everything, from the order in which the transactions should be processed to what the next block should look like. And it’s not uncommon for nodes to contend with different, and sometimes conflicting, proposals on what the next block should be. However, aside from the different proposals, there is always a “longest chain” or “heaviest chain.” This is the one chain that is ultimately approved and considered “true” by the consensus protocol. It’s referred to as the “world state.” All of this work and building of the blockchain takes a lot of energy. In fact, maintaining the bitcoin blockchain for one year consumes as much energy as the entire country of Ireland uses in that same time period. Therefore, to help them cover their electricity costs, miners and validators are allowed to give themselves 12 bitcoins for every block they add. As you might imagine, the decentralized nature of blockchain makes the process a bit slow compared to conventional databases. In a conventional database like MySQL or VoltDB, a new entry takes a few milliseconds. However, for the Ethereum blockchain, which represents today’s most advanced blockchain, a new entry takes an average of three minutes. Nonetheless, that means blockchains are a thousand times faster than transactions made on the stock market, which take around three days to finalize. And compared to credit card payments, which take around four months, a blockchain transaction is about 100,000 times faster. Blockchains aren’t just a database for digital currency, though. They can also be used to create a binding contract between two or more parties. In the world of contracts, any number of things can cause one or more of the parties to fail to fulfill their contractual obligations. And this can result in endless and exhausting periods of litigation. Blockchains may obviate many contractual issues, however, since they can manage smart contracts. A smart contract not only stores the details of an agreement; it can execute the terms of the agreement as well. Smart contracts are essentially a legal text written as a computer program and inscribed into a blockchain. And since blockchains never forget anything, a smart contract is certain to execute on time. So a blockchain smart contract can be used to trigger a payment at a certain time, whether the payment is made in cryptocurrency or with a traditional credit card. Or it could guarantee that digital goods, such as a music or video file, are transferred to a party’s email account. Through the use of smart contracts, blockchains make it possible for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to operate. Bitcoin and Ethereum are just two examples of this kind of organization. A DAO is essentially a company built out of computer code and managed by blockchain. It functions through a series of smart contracts that interact with each other in order to perform certain functions. You could think of a DAO as a car that not only drives itself but also regularly tunes itself up and takes care of itself. Some smart contracts function as the engine and keep it running, while others pay for gas or charge the battery. And though the car represents its own organization, it could also be part of an Uber-like network. However, while things can run smoothly in a DAO, there can come a time when a problem arises and, with it, a question: Who should be held responsible? One thing should be clear by now: blockchains are not a fad. It’s already been proven that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize commerce and finance. But there are some issues that need to be worked out. One of the most important problems is that blockchains can lose data. This isn’t a common or likely problem, but it is something that’s already happened to the Bitcoin blockchain. This happens when two or more of the large groups in the computer network – the ones responsible for storing the information – are unable to agree on the correct state of the blockchain. When this occurs, the network forks, or splits. So you could ask two nodes about your Bitcoin account, and if each node is on a different side of the split network, you could get two different account statements. Obviously, this would be a nightmare for every financial institution using the blockchain. A split can also occur if the connection between the nodes is cut. This would cause the formation of isolated groups within the network. But such a split would be resolved as soon as the connection is reestablished. The network will always accept the group with the highest computing power as the “true” state of the blockchain. This is because the “longest” chain requires the most power and is considered the most up-to-date. Unfortunately, this would mean that all transactions made on the smaller, rejected chain would be lost. Another issue with blockchains is that it’s impossible to be completely anonymous or confidential. Every transaction requires a sender address and a receiver address. These addresses are also called pseudonyms, and are only a long string of letters and numbers – things like “17fHXHDB8.” But the details of every transaction can be seen by everyone. So if someone’s paying close attention, it’s quite possible for the patterns and details of your transactions to reveal your true identity. This lack of confidentiality, especially as it pertains to extremely sensitive data such as medical information, might prevent blockchain becoming widely popular. But there’s also hope that the issue could soon be resolved. Unless you’re really familiar with blockchain or digital currencies, chances are you haven’t heard of Ethereum. But let’s have a look at this recent development in blockchain. Bitcoin may be the first blockchain, but it’s also limited. It’s focused exclusively on money, whereas Ethereum is a general-purpose blockchain, which makes it much more versatile. In addition to cryptocurrencies, Ethereum enables you to build such things as land-title registries and the kind of rating systems used on eBay and Amazon. Ethereum was invented in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, who wanted to avoid the problem that highly specialized blockchains were experiencing when being employed for other uses. So, even at the time of its conception, Ethereum was meant to do many things well, and this is the reason it’s the most advanced blockchain to date. Like other DAOs, Ethereum isn’t owned by anyone. It’s also free and highly accessible, thanks to an intuitive programming language called Solidity. Ethereum does come with its own digital currency – or its own bitcoin, so to speak – called ether. This is the currency you’d use on the Ethereum blockchain to pay for transactions, running calculations or storing data. While Bitcoin may be the king of the cryptocurrency world today, ether, thanks to its more adaptable blockchain, could become the preferred digital-payment method of the future. Now that we’ve taken a broad look at Ethereum, let’s put some of the specifics under the microscope. There are a number of ideas and potential applications of the Ethereum blockchain that make it quite exciting. For example, the Ethereum blockchain could make voting virtually tamperproof. Every voter could use their signature to make an entry in the blockchain that would represent their vote. In this system, no one could change it since the proof-of-work process would forbid it. Plus, the process of vote counting would be completely transparent. Another possibility for Ethereum is in the management of land titles, especially in developing countries where the confusion over land ownership has held back the economy. The Ethereum blockchain would again make this process fully transparent and straightforward. And then there’s banking. It comes as no surprise that most major banking corporations have been funding research of blockchain technology. The financial market, along with trading in stocks and other assets, could benefit greatly from the transparent and programmable nature of blockchains. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Ethereum could also improve escrow payments, social networking, ridesharing, employment services, crowdfunding platforms and much more. However, since Ethereum is open-source software and without warranties, there is concern about how trustworthy it really is. This is an important issue for big corporations, since they’ll never agree to use something that isn’t fully reliable and bug-free. In this respect, Ethereum’s developers have yet to make real efforts to make it ready for corporate use. Finally, there’s the issue of the imposition of government regulations in the future. Blockchains can be used for criminal activities, like money laundering or black market sales, which could result in some governments imposing heavy regulations or even outlawing blockchain technology. But the fact remains that blockchains have the potential to change our world just as profoundly as the internet did. And as it stands now, Ethereum could be the blockchain of the future, since it is by far the most advanced we’ve seen to date. The key message in this book: Blockchains are not a hype. They have real potential to bring about major change and Ethereum is the most advanced blockchain to emerge. This is because it isn’t highly specified, but rather a general-purpose blockchain that can be used in a wide variety of social and commercial spheres. Got feedback?

Maybe you know someone who uses a 3D printer to manufacture cute little action figures – or something equally inconsequential – in his living room. Sure, 3D printing is neat, but it doesn’t seem very revolutionary. Well, what we’re seeing today is actually just the tip of iceberg. Over the next few decades, 3D printing is going to change many areas of our lives – from the working world to cooking to the ways we treat serious illnesses. These blinks will tell you more about the latent power of this emergent technology. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you soon won’t have to be rich to become a producer; about designer legs; and whether 3D printing is going to save the environment. Even if you’re not very computer literate, you probably know how to use an everyday inkjet printer. You click “print” and the machine spits out a piece of paper with some words or maybe a photograph printed on it. A 3D printer is a whole other story. Rather than imprinting a two-dimensional piece of paper with ink, a 3D printer is designed to build objects, varying in size and shape, out of a wide array of materials. Like a standard printer, a 3D printer can’t do anything without a computer to tell it what to print. The computer is needed to send the 3D printer information from a design file, which is basically an electronic blueprint for what you want to build. So if you want to print a copy of your favorite seventeenth-century brass vase, for instance, you have to first get the right design file. With that, the computer can tell the printer to fabricate a replica that is an exact match in each and every way. The printer does this by painstakingly building a three-dimensional object, one layer at a time. For your brass vase, it would start with the bottom, creating a thin, flat layer of brass that represents the base. Once that solidifies, another layer is added to the top of the first one. And this process continues – a new layer being added after the solidification of the last one – until the entire vase is finished. By changing the dimensions of each layer, an object of any shape can be created. Using this process, anyone can fabricate any object, as long as the details are contained in the design file. In the blinks that follow, we’ll explore the major impact 3D printing will have on our lives, the economy and the environment. But first, we’ll take a closer look at the software that makes it all possible. Did you know that most of the furniture in your home was probably designed digitally with the help of sophisticated computer software? In all likelihood, that lamp on your desk, or even the desk itself, was once a concept that only existed as ones and zeros in a computer file. What’s great about design software is that it offers designers and engineers the opportunity to shape and model their designs in a three-dimensional environment. This is extremely useful since it offers a world filled with geometric possibilities that two-dimensional blueprints simply lack. Take a look around. Everything you see – the entire world – is made up of countless interacting shapes. Obviously, it’s hard to accurately represent the three-dimensionality of all these shapes on a flat piece of paper. But with the help of 3D design software, you can create a perfect model of whatever object you wish to create – be it a house, a car, a coffee mug or even a flower. The software creates these accurate reproductions by using an XYZ coordinate system and programing that involves highly complicated mathematical equations. This allows you to move your object around, observe it from any conceivable angle and design the tiniest details. If you want to turn your object upside down or look at it from directly above, you can; the XYZ coordinates will readjust to whatever angle you desire. You can also adjust the proportions of your object. Widening your vase’s aperture, for instance, is just a matter of stretching it out on the screen. Making it smaller is just as easy. All of this can be done with ease; it’s not necessary to redesign the entire thing. Thus, 3D design software provides an invaluable service. It gives you a safe environment to experiment and realize your vision. In the next blink, we’ll see how 3D printing differs from traditional production methods. You might be asking yourself: What advantages does 3D printing really provide? After all, traditional production methods have worked so far, right? Sure, today’s methods of mass production enable the efficient production of specific products. But we run into problems when the product needs to be changed. When a production line is set up, every piece of machinery and each worker is assigned a very specific task so that work can be done precisely and at a low cost. This works well if you want to churn out millions of copies of the same product. On the other hand, it also makes it difficult to change even one design detail. Say you make toothbrushes. One day, inspiration strikes, and you have a genius idea for a new and improved model. Well, unfortunately for you and your company, this would mean major changes: production couldn’t get rolling until personnel were retrained and assigned new tasks. As you can imagine, the more complicated the new product, the trickier the reorganization process. Okay, but let’s say you’re an artisan of some kind. Artisanal production is the polar opposite of mass production. Products are usually hand crafted and one-of-a-kind – things that can’t be made on an assembly line. Artisanal products take more time and money to produce but they also give the producer more freedom. It’s easy enough to alter a design or add custom touches. If a customer wants to order a personalized vase, for instance, there’s no problem. The sculptor could even add a unique inscription. The downside is that artisanal businesses can only produce so many products. But there are compensatory perks: less overhead, for example, and the fact that customers are usually willing to pay more money for a unique product. But wouldn’t it be nice to find the middle ground between artisanal and mass production? Well, that’s where 3D printing comes in. Like mass production, 3D printing allows you to make an endless number of precise reproductions. Though the printing process can’t be broken down into simple steps that would increase output and lower the price per unit, it does allow for freedom of design changes. At any time, product design can be easily altered without fear of business repercussions. Over a century ago, the assembly line disrupted the manufacturing status quo. It forever transformed the job market and the way companies do business. And this is exactly the kind of disruptive potential 3D printing has. First of all, traditional production systems could be revolutionized by cloud manufacturing. Nowadays, the majority of manufacturing is done by a few giant factories. But cloud manufacturing works by decentralizing production and spreading it over a network of small contributors. If you have a product, you can simply add your design file to the cloud and the system will match it with the appropriate manufacturer and make sure that they receive your order and deliver it to your address. With this method, you can have a wide array of options. You can get a big order printed, a single part or anything in between. Maybe you spent the past few months designing your own bike and want to test it out. Using cloud manufacturing, you could get the parts of your bike delivered the next day and assemble them yourself to give it a test ride. This business model shifts the focus away from big factories, expensive machinery and the engineers needed to operate them. It allows small-scale manufacturing companies to enter the marketplace, which will inevitably change the way the business world operates. We’ll no longer have to rely on mass production; cloud manufacturing gives anyone with a design file the chance to start a business. This business model will also lead to more innovation since it greatly reduces risk and cost. Since today’s big manufacturing companies use enormous, complex and expensive equipment and technology, any attempt at innovation requires a huge investment. Such an investment represents a considerable risk since any failed attempt can leave a company with severe losses. 3D printing removes the costs and risks of experimentation. If you want to print a test run of a new product, just prepare the design file, click “print” and see what happens. Perhaps the most exciting thing about 3D printing is the limitless possibilities. In addition to making it easy to print standard material goods, the technology also has the potential to save lives. People are already climbing what’s known as 3D printing’s “ladder of life.” The ladder of life is a model that represents complexity, with each rung signifying how difficult it is to print a certain thing. The lower rungs are occupied by things that are relatively easy to print – inanimate objects such as hearing aids or artificial joints. Halfway up the ladder, things get more complicated: living tissues, bones, skin and veins. After that come organs like the liver, kidney and heart. At the top of the ladder are living creatures. We’re a long way from the top of the ladder of life, but we’re getting pretty good at printing things from the lower rungs, such as replacement bones that are designed to fit perfectly into a person’s body. There’s even a start-up in California called Bespoke Innovations that prints custom-made prosthetic legs that not only fit an individual’s body but are designed to complement that person’s lifestyle and personality. In the future, we’ll probably start 3D printing food. Sometimes, after a long day’s work, the last thing you want to do is prepare a meal. Well, imagine sending an email from work that tells your 3D printer to have lasagne and tiramisu ready for you when you get home. That idea isn’t so far-fetched: 3D food printers are already being tested in laboratories. One design team by the name of Zigelbaum & Coelho has created Cornucopia, a project consisting of four different 3D food printers, each devoted to a different type of “cooking.” One of them even prints out chocolate. In our final blink, we’ll take a look at some of the concerns raised by 3D printing. 3D printing has given rise to a slew of concerns. Foremost among them is its carbon footprint. Today, most manufacturing companies still use petroleum-based fuels to manufacture and transport their products and, as a result, harm the environment with their large carbon footprint. These companies also produce enormous amounts of non-recyclable waste that pollutes the earth and the ocean. Unfortunately, 3D printing doesn’t solve environmental problems related to regular ways of manufacturing. In fact, when compared with current mass-production standards, its carbon footprint and waste production can be worse. Of all wasteful materials, plastic is among the worst. It’s everywhere and just about everything comes packaged in it. And plastic, though versatile and cheap, isn’t environmentally friendly. This remains a major issue for 3D printing. According to researchers at the University of Nottingham, 3D printers are voracious consumers of energy. For example, if you tell an average 3D printer and a traditional production machine to make an object of equal weight, the 3D printer will consume up to 10 times more electricity than its more traditional counterpart. And since many industrial-sized 3D printers use thermoset plastic, a material that can’t be recycled after it is heated, they actually create more waste. It’s not all bad news, however. The researchers at the University of Nottingham did spot some benefits too. After traditional manufacturers heat up their plastic and press it into molds, they use “release agents” to pry the plastic out. These substances are generally toxic chemicals that add to the harmful waste that gets produced. 3D printing avoids the need for release agents since the plastic never reaches the same degree of heat in the process. Another good example of an environmental advantage to 3D printing is metal. Traditional metal manufacturing results in literally tons of wasteful byproduct. When making airplane parts, for instance, manufacturers will process 15 kilograms of metal to make a part that weighs just one kilogram. In contrast, nearly 100 percent of the leftover metal powder that 3D printers use can be recycled. Clearly, 3D printing can’t solve all the world’s problems, but it’s still early days and there are benefits and exciting possibilities that make the technology a fascinating tool that will continue to be explored. The key message in this book: The age of 3D printing is upon us, and it has the potential to change our lives. Even though the technology is still in its infancy and comes with disadvantages in certain areas compared to mass production, it will certainly provide great opportunities and innovative remedies in the future.

Your Facebook profile? Your Twitter account? Almost certainly more often than you’d think. The influence of the internet and the cloud on almost all areas of society is massive – and, mostly, inestimably beneficial. However, as these blinks will show you, there is a dark side to this force. It’s made possible hitherto unimagined forms of crime. And it isn’t just hackers in the murky waters of cyberspace that pose a threat to our integrity and safety. Companies like Google, Facebook and even Angry Birds play a role in this, too. That is, unless we read the fine print in the user agreements. But, honestly, when is the last time you read one of those? Luckily, there are other ways to protect ourselves. These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll learn what Angry Birds knows about you; why writing your novel in Google Docs might be a bad idea; and why your city’s Sewer Department maybe shouldn’t be connected to the internet.  We’ve come a long way since the 1950s, when a single computer could barely fit inside a small building. Compare that with the world of today, where the iPhone in your pocket has more computing power than all of NASA during the Apollo 11 moon landing. But nowadays, technology is more than machines and gadgets. Rather, it’s an essential part of our lives – so essential, in fact, that over 80 percent of us check our phones within the first few minutes of waking up. And then we keep the same phones within three feet of us at all times. Our attachment to our phones can also be highly emotional. According to one US study, more than 90 percent of Americans feel high levels of anxiety if they forget their phone at home. Similarly, research from 2013 showed that Americans were spending more than five hours online every single day! We book our doctor’s appointments, check our bank statements and health insurance bills online, and browse Facebook and Amazon without considering the digital footprint we’re leaving behind. Often, our obsession with technology makes us forget that we’re putting our lives in the hands of software that can easily be hacked. This ignorance (or negligence) comes at a price. One study showed that, about 75 percent of the time, hackers successfully infiltrated the devices they attacked within mere minutes. This could in part be due to the fact that in 2015 “123456” and “password” remained the most popular passwords. To combat this, many companies have begun implementing multifactor authentication methods (e.g., using your password and a one-time code sent to you via SMS) to improve security. But you should nonetheless change your passwords regularly, keep them over 20 digits long and include numbers, symbols and spaces. Avoid being counted among the 50 percent of people who use the same password for all their online accounts. We take our smartphones everywhere: to the toilet, to the gym and even to bed. You could say that our smartphones know us pretty well. They have plenty of data on our habits and our relationships, but how well is that data protected? As it turns out, you aren’t the only one with access to your personal information. In fact, your mobile phone acts a lot like a spy who knows exactly what you’re doing, where you’re doing it, who you’re doing it with, not to mention for how long and how often. For example, Google has developed technology that enables it to access calls made on your Android device, and use your conversation and the sounds around you to create targeted ads. Say you made a call while Usher was playing in the background; next time you googled something, an ad about his next concert might pop up. We’re mostly oblivious to all this data-gathering. A study done by Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute revealed that only five percent of Angry Birds’ users knew that the app collects locational data, which it then sells to advertisement companies. These companies then use this information as a forecasting tool to determine your future behavior and, thus, your purchases.  In fact, according to a McAfee report, 82 percent of all Android apps check your online activities and 80 percent collect your location data without your permission. But should you care about location privacy? Who cares about your whereabouts anyway? In 2012 a Russian company launched an app called Girls Around Me that provided users with an interactive map displaying Facebook profile pictures, status updates and check-ins of the women in their proximity. The app was even approved by the Google Play and Apple App Stores! Is this social media or stalking? Whatever it is, it should be enough to make you think twice before skipping through the Terms of Service Agreement for your next app purchase. So how is it that Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn can all offer their services for free?  Most people assume it’s because of the money they make from advertisements. But that’s only part of it. In actuality, you aren’t really their customer at all. Rather, you’re their product and primary source of income. Today, everything is connected via iCloud or Google products. But that convenience comes at a cost: our privacy. Just imagine all the intimate insights into your private life that you’ve unwittingly shared with Google: that time years ago when you googled “Symptoms of gonorrhea” or “Am I pregnant?” These searches didn’t fade with the passage of time. They’re still stored in a database somewhere, and could be used against you when you least expect it. That’s exactly what happened to British 26-year-old Van Bryan, who, before traveling to the US, tweeted to a friend that they should meet “before I go and destroy America.” Unfortunately, the US Department of Homeland Security didn’t appreciate the poetry of this party metaphor; they flagged him as a potential security threat and barred him and his partner from entering the United States. Very often we simply have no idea what kind of information we’re giving up and what it will be used for. That’s because terms and conditions, which outline that information, are designed such that we ignore everything on the page except “I Agree.” One day you might walk by a pharmacy and see a picture you took last summer of your child playing in the sand in an advertisement for children’s sunblock. If it’s on Instagram, it’s no longer yours. Similarly, all the documents you store on Google Drive belong to Google. If J. K. Rowling had written Harry Potter using Google Docs, she would have given Google the rights to the book and squandered her potential $15 billion fortune along with it. Hacking has come a long way since 1971, when Apple founders Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs hacked into phone networks and sold hacking devices called  “blue boxes” to their fellow students at UC Berkeley. Nowadays, hackers understand that whoever possesses information has the upper hand in “the game.” Thanks to Edward Snowden’s leaks, we’ve learned that this is exactly what the National Security Agency (NSA) is after when spying on billions of people and leaders around the world – the upper hand. But the US government isn’t the only one trying to get their hands on information. In fact, in 2010 Google publicly admitted that hackers in China’s People’s Liberation Army had targeted their global password management system, thus granting them access to the accounts and web searches of millions of Google customers worldwide. Or consider another mass invasion of privacy that occurred in 2013, when the personal information from 110 million accounts was stolen from retail company Target’s database by a 17-year-old Russian hacker. As our data migrates away from physical silos into “the Cloud,” the need to protect our information becomes even more pressing. From a business perspective, the cloud seems like a great idea because of its implications for innovation, productivity and entrepreneurship. However, from the standpoint of public policy, security and law, problems such as privacy rights and the jurisdictional aspect of criminalizing hackers still need to be addressed. Questions like, “Where was the crime actually committed?” or “Where does the criminal operate from?” aren’t easily answered within the current legal framework. Thus, regular citizens share the responsibility of staying informed about cyber regulations. We must encrypt the data on our computers and phones with encryption programs, such as BitLocker and FileVault, and by keeping the operating system up to date. We know the stereotype of a hacker: a 16-year-old computer whiz in a dimly lit room, hacking victims for the thrill of it. But according to a study by the Rand Corporation, 80 percent of hackers actually work for a company or government, and are closer to the age of 30. Indeed, cybercrime is much more organized, meaning we have to be extremely careful about what we post online. When you post about your upcoming vacation or weekend beach getaway on Facebook and Twitter, for example, you’re actually warmly inviting organized burglars to come and rob your home in your absence. Criminals have even used a website, PleaseRobMe.com, dedicated to this purpose. On it, they can window-shop for empty homes to ransack. And according to a 2011 study of convicted burglars in the UK, 78 percent admitted to having monitored Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare before choosing which house to rob. Alternatively, hackers can also target you by examining the hidden data embedded in the pictures you post online, such as the GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken. So, think twice before showing off your new diamond ring or your plasma TV on Facebook for the world to see. Some people, distraught by how easily hackers can obtain their data, think that the solution is to get rid of these online profiles. But things aren’t so simple. Someone could easily create an online profile posing as you, and it’s far better that you control what sensitive information you post, rather than someone else. Just be careful about what you post on social networks, and consider the possibility that there will most likely be someone watching besides your Facebook friends. In addition to privacy issues, however, these new technologies have other, far-reaching effects. Our final blinks will look at how our reliance on the internet affects society as a whole. Imagine a world where your alarm clock could connect with traffic cameras to adjust your alarm based on congestion estimates. Or where you didn’t need to ask your children whether they’d brushed their teeth because their toothbrushes would send a message to your phone once they had done it. While this may sound like a futuristic Hollywood movie, the technology is already here. In fact, Cisco has predicted that there will be 50 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020, compared to the 13 billion in 2013. The trend has been to connect any and all devices in the hope that it will make our lives easier. Many of us have already begun using RFID tags, wireless electromagnetic fields used to transfer data. We find these, for example, in our work ID tags that we use to get into our office or hotel buildings, in “wave and pay” credit cards and in the E-ZPass that we use to pay highway tolls. In Australia, RFID tags are even used to monitor the location of 300 sharks off the coast. If they come too close to the beach, the chips implanted in their skin send an electronic signal that is turned into a tweet that warns tourists at the beach of possible danger. And that’s just the beginning. If we’re already vulnerable to cyber attacks through computers and phones, imagine having hundreds of hackable devices in your home. We’re only now learning that the cameras on our phones, computers, baby monitors and security systems could be streaming live to someone on the other side of the world, even when we think they are turned off. Luckily, this problem has a simple fix: when you’re not using your laptop’s camera, just stick a small Post-It on it to cover the lens. While the internet has helped us to “modernize” our infrastructure, it has also put us at greater risk. Our railways, gas pipelines, 911-dispatch systems, air traffic controls, stock markets, drinking water, streetlights, hospitals, sanitation systems and electrical grids all depend on the internet to function properly. We have to ask ourselves: Is that a good idea? Hacking any of these critical infrastructural systems could have catastrophic consequences. Targeting a city’s electricity grid, for example, would leave that city in complete chaos. There would be no lights, no elevators, no ATMs. Garage doors wouldn’t open, traffic lights wouldn't work, air traffic control would be unable to contact the airplanes in the sky. There would be no cellphones and no internet. This happened in South Houston, where the Water and Sewer Department was hacked by an attacker who was traced to Russia using his IP address. Luckily, nobody got hurt, as he was only able to cause the water pumps to fail. But if he had mixed the wrong amount of chemicals to treat the water, he could have easily poisoned or even killed thousands of people. Clearly, connecting our infrastructure to the internet has some inherent dangers, and we should seriously consider whether it’s actually worth the risk. Consider our prison system. In California, for example, an alleged computer glitch in a program designed to ease overcrowding in many of the state’s prisons led prison officials to release 450 dangerous criminals on unsupervised parole. Then there’s the national Criminal Records Bureau, which admitted that more than 20,000 people had been criminalized due to errors in computer systems. Errors like this could damage your credit and prevent you from buying a car, a house or even from applying for a job. Even if you know you’ve filed your taxes correctly and on time, for example, an “error” could suggest that you committed tax evasion and ruin your life.  There’s no denying that newly emerging technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and 3D printers will have an unimaginable impact on our lives. Whether these technologies will have a positive or negative effect on society depends much on who controls them. Ultimately, we decide what the consequences of this technology will be. Physicist Stephen Hawking and entrepreneur Elon Musk, for instance, have both argued that the rapid development of technology in areas such as artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and synthetic biology will forever alter humanity’s path. There will simply be no turning back. We have to decide how much of this technology we want in our lives. For instance, while having a driverless car sounds very enticing and fascinating, would you want to entrust the lives of your family to a car driven by a system that could easily be hacked? Given the cyber threats we face every day, there are a few things you can keep in mind to make you less vulnerable to such attacks. For one, be mindful of the pictures you take, and, if you send them to someone, always encrypt them! For that matter, encrypt all of your data. Create a “guest” account on your computer, and use this account for your day-to-day use. Only use the “admin” account when updating programs from a trusted source. This will make it harder for malware and hackers to infiltrate your system. Next, turn off your computer when you are not using it. Do the same with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and hot spots when you don’t need them. Finally, when you use your credit card or want to check your banking balance, only do it on your own device. Using a friend’s phone, or an airport or coffee shop network, will only put your data at greater risk! The key message in this book: Modern technology and the internet have changed not only the way we interact with one another, but also the way criminals commit crimes. With so much of our information floating around on the net, and with so little prudence about what we share, we constantly put ourselves at risk. Actionable advice: Take the time to research new apps. Do your homework and make sure you understand whether your new favorite app actually protects your privacy and location. If not, you put yourself at risk of totally avoidable criminal abuse.

On the one hand, you’ve got the greasy-haired geeks of academia who speak in zeroes and ones. On the other, you’ve got the hackers. There are good hackers and bad hackers, of course – both greedy hackers who plunder bank accounts and heroic hackers who unveil the misdeeds of corrupt regimes. Yet they all have one thing in common: they’re cunning and smart and their life is exciting. Well, obviously it’s not that simple. A hacker’s life isn’t all excitement and intrigue. But there are some people who certainly make it seem that way. Kevin Mitnick is one such person. Mitnick’s life story is chock-full of exciting escapades. So let’s dive into the personal history of this notorious hacker. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Mitnick’s passion for magic got him started with hacking; how he outwitted the FBI; and how he eventually became an ethical hacker. Born on August 6, 1963, Kevin Mitnick was an only child raised primarily by his mother, Shelly Mitnick. They lived an itinerant life in Southern California, as Shelly looked for work and entangled herself in a string of bad relationships. The constant movement meant Kevin didn’t get much of a chance to make friends. Plus, his mother’s boyfriends had a bad habit of being abusive to Kevin, which probably contributed to the development of his anti-authority attitude. Kevin managed to get decent grades in school, and he excelled in sports, but his imagination was captured by an extracurricular activity: magic. When Kevin was ten years old, a neighbor showed him a magic trick. It was love at first sight. Kevin loved the element of deception and became obsessed with practicing tricks and discovering ways of manipulating the audience, all of which would influence his later escapades. When he was 13, Kevin could often be found at the Survival Bookstore, perusing the pages of The Big Brother Game, a step-by-step guide on how to gain access to people’s property records, their driving history and even their bank account details. These were techniques that would continue to come in handy as Kevin got further into the world of social engineering. As the young Mitnick would come to learn, social engineering is the subtle art of manipulating people so that they do what you want. And the first key is to establish trust. Say you want to call a company and acquire some specific information. You’ll sound more trustworthy if you use the correct terminology and lingo – the words and phrases used by everyone else at the company. Using this technique, Mitnick was able to pick up a phone and, by saying the right things, get records and personal information on friends, teachers, and even some people he’d never met. It might sound unlikely, but it worked more often than not. And this was all before his seventeenth birthday! The 1980s were the perfect time to exploit the digital world; digital records were increasingly popular, yet security systems were still rather simple. But before he moved to computers, Mitnick sought to find out just how far he could get with a simple phone call. On one occasion, he called the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and gained access to all the files he wanted. All he had to do was call up the offices and pose as a police officer. Naturally, the DMV clerk asked for his “Requester Code,” which was exactly the sort of specific terminology Mitnick needed. He could now call the local police station, posing as a DMV representative, and ask to confirm the Requester Code of a particular officer. Mitnick simply made up a code on the spot, and the person at the police station corrected his mistake by giving him the right code. It was as easy as that. He could now call the DMV back and gain access to any address, license plate number or driving record for anyone in the state of California. However, it wasn’t long before Kevin had his first run in with the authorities. What got him in trouble was his attempt to get a phony computer administrator account at a research company where his friend’s father worked. Everything went fine for a while. He used the father’s account to bypass the shoddy security system, and once he was in the system, he easily gained access to an administrator account. The problem arose when his friend Micah accessed the admin account on his own and forgot to cover his tracks. The company noticed the security breach and had to notify the FBI, thinking that Micah’s father was the hacker. The father questioned Micah about the incident and Micah eventually pointed the finger at Mitnick. The FBI soon paid Mitnick a visit, but there was little they could do. Not only were there no laws on computer hacking in the 1980s; Mitnick wasn’t yet 18 years old. So all Mitnick received was a stern warning, and it wasn’t long before he went right back to his mischievous ways. Kevin Mitnick liked to see how far he could go with a simple phone call or a modem – he was never into hacking for personal or financial gain. But this distinction didn’t prevent him from getting into trouble with the authorities. This time, no mistakes were made. It was a scorned woman who put him in hot water. Mitnick wanted to see if he could hack into the giant company US Leasing, and he recruited a friend named Lewis to help him. The job started with a phone call. Mitnick posed as a network technician calling to warn the company about a computer bug that was putting their data at risk of being lost. This was enough to convince the company to provide an admin account so that they could “fix” the system. Everything was fine until Lewis broke up with his girlfriend, Susan, who happened also to be a hacker. Using the account data that Lewis left lying around, Susan entered the US Leasing system and had every possible machine in the company print out pages with Kevin Mitnick’s name on them. And that wasn’t all. When Susan learned that Lewis and Mitnick had also worked together to steal the employee manuals from a local phone company, she immediately called the cops, leading to Mitnick’s arrest. Mitnick was not yet 18, so he was sentenced to 90 days in a juvenile detention center. The judge overseeing Mitnick’s case was thoroughly confused by what had happened. Here was someone who was going through all this trouble to get his hands on personal data, but he wasn’t doing anything with it. Since hacking for the mere thrill of it was unheard of in the early 1980s, the judge assumed Mitnick was profiting from it somehow. Mitnick turned 18 in juvie. And even though he’d be tried as an adult if he were ever caught again, he didn’t stop. Kevin Mitnick was already making a name for himself in the local IT community; his juvenile offense had been reported on in the LA Times. This newfound notoriety brought some new problems. For a start, being known as a hacker meant he’d probably have trouble putting his skills toward legitimate computer work. After all, which company would want to give a talented hacker access to their system? Luckily, however, after completing a six-month computing course at a trade school, Mitnick was able to use the school’s job placement program to find work at the telephone company GTE. If you guessed that GTE was one of the companies Mitnick had hacked, you were right. Luckily, the HR department never picked up on this, and it looked as though Mitnick was going to get paid for doing what he loved. That’s right, the job was to hack the company’s system on purpose in order to identify weaknesses and build stronger security. If this sounds too good to be true, sadly, it was. Since the job would involve getting access to sensitive information, GTE required the filling out of a security form. Mitnick knew this spelled doom for him; once they ran a background check, they’d realize who they were dealing with. Sure enough, after only nine days on the job, Mitnick was let go. And, unemployed, Mitnick went right back to his old ways. He had a girlfriend at the time, and though he told her he was taking night classes at UCLA, he was actually spending his evenings hacking. When Mitnick hacked into the software company, Santa Cruz Operations (SCO), he was caught red-handed, and this time he faced more than just criminal charges. SCO filed a lawsuit against him and his girlfriend for 1.4 million dollars – each! However, when the dust settled, it came to light that SCO was actually using the lawsuit as a way to pressure Mitnick into revealing the methods he’d used to hack into their network. Mitnick cooperated and SCO dropped the charges. This time, he managed to get away with just three years probation. In 1989, Kevin Mitnick was again ratted out by a friend, and this time he spent four months in jail. Though he initially saw this as a much needed wake-up call – the warning that would get him back on the straight and narrow – when he got out of jail, he was hit with bad news right away. While he was locked up, his girlfriend had been cheating on him with his closest friend, Lewis. But what really inspired Mitnick to jump back in the hacking game was Eric Heinz, a hacker he’d heard about through a friend. Supposedly he was the new whiz kid on the block and Mitnick was eager to find out more. When they met, Mitnick was immediately fascinated by Heinz and he could tell that he really knew his stuff. But Heinz was also extremely paranoid, which made Mitnick uneasy. The other oddity about Heinz was that he seemed to be getting by financially without having any discernible job. And when Mitnick got back home after the meeting, he tried to find some trace of him through the usual channels but could come up with nothing. The mystery deepened. But one thing was certain. Heinz told Mitnick that he had his hands on access codes that could be used to hack into any phone system on the west coast. In other words, they had the power to listen in on any phone call in California. It was intriguing, to say the least, but Mitnick couldn’t shake the feeling that Heinz was acting suspiciously. Furthermore, after their first meeting, Heinz kept on coming up with excuses to cancel future meetings. Mitnick was sure something was up, and was starting to become confident that whoever he’d met wasn’t a real hacker. Mitnick eventually began listening in on Heinz’s phone calls and, sure enough, he was right. This imposter was actually an FBI agent, and he overheard him talking to another agent about getting a search warrant for Mitnick’s house and setting up a sting operation to put Mitnick back behind bars. Luckily, the FBI had no clue that Mitnick was eavesdropping on their phone conversations. This gave Mitnick the upper hand – and possibly a way to avoid their trap. At this point, it was the early 1990s and the 28-year-old Mitnick began a careful dance with the FBI, listening to their plans and trying to stay one step ahead of them at all times. He knew the FBI was staking out his apartment, watching him from neighboring windows and hoping to gather enough evidence for a search warrant. So he carefully cleared his apartment of anything that might be used against him, and then he stuck a note on his refrigerator that read “FBI doughnuts” to let them know he was well aware of their plan. It would seem that the FBI didn’t take kindly to this message since a search party soon came knocking and ransacked his apartment. But Mitnick had been thorough in his clean-up job and the FBI came up empty handed. It was a hollow victory for Mitnick, though. They’d found nothing this time, but it was likely that they had no intention of stopping their investigation. Shortly afterward, Mitnick’s three-year probation was finally up, making it legal for him to travel. It was just in the nick of time, too, since three days later the FBI went to his mother’s house, where he’d recently been staying, to try and serve a warrant for his arrest. Clearly, if he had hoped to stay out of prison, Mitnick needed to get out of town. He decided to start over, with a new identity, and so he moved to that metropolis of dreams and deceit, Las Vegas, Nevada. Putting his social engineering skills to use, Mitnick got a birth certificate and social security number for a name that he idolized: Eric Weiss, the actual birth name of master illusionist, Harry Houdini. While establishing his new life as Eric Weiss, Mitnick kept all his money and his ID on his person at all times. But there’s a reason people shouldn’t walk around with $11,000, which is how much Mitnick lost when a thief broke into his gym locker. That was every penny Mitnick had; it was time to get a real job. And so Mitnick decided to move to Denver, Colorado, where he set about sifting through the job ads in the local newspaper. This led to an interview at the law firm Holme, Roberts & Owen. While the interview went well, there was the matter of coming up with a résumé and references. But Mitnick did this without breaking a sweat; he simply invented a fake company in Las Vegas with a PO box and phone number connected to an answering machine. Then he called up the law firm posing as his former employer and gave Eric Weiss a glowing recommendation. Three days later, Mitnick had a legitimate job working in the firm’s computer department. But this certainly didn’t bring his hacking days to an end. Cell-phone technology was making leaps and bounds in the early nineties, and Mitnick was eager to unravel the programming codes, or source codes, that ran these new devices. Motorola, Nokia and NEC, the industry leaders at the time, were at the top of Mitnick’s hit list. Motorola and Nokia went smoothly. He got in, found the source code and covered his tracks on the way out. But with NEC, he wasn’t so lucky. While he was in the process of double checking to make he wasn’t being tracked or followed, he intercepted an email from an NEC admin that said the FBI was aware that someone had transferred their source codes to a server in Los Angeles. This was exactly what Mitnick had just accomplished! Mitnick’s heart was racing. The FBI was still on his trail, and if he wanted to stay out of jail, he’d need to take better precautions. In early 1994, Mitnick was enjoying his new job with the Denver law firm. Little did he know it was about to come to an abrupt end. He had gotten into the habit of using his lunch break to make social engineering calls on his cell phone and his bosses were starting to take notice. They believed Mitnick was using company time to conduct outside consultancy work. In the spring of 1994, at the age of 30, Kevin Mitnick was once again unemployed. So he did what he’d done before. He hit the reset button by relocating and changing his name. This time, he became Brian Merrill of Seattle, Washington. Mitnick didn’t have any problems finding a job in Seattle’s booming tech industry, but his life as a fugitive from the law was starting to take a toll on his psyche. His paranoia had gotten so bad that a helicopter flying overhead would trigger a panic attack. He was becoming convinced that the authorities could use his cell phone signal to track his whereabouts. But, in an ironic twist, it was Mitnick’s method of covering his tracks that finally caught the attention of Seattle law enforcement. He’d been using cloning methods so that he wouldn’t have to pay for his phone calls and to make it appear that he was calling from a different phone number. And what began as an inquiry by local authorities into illegal cell-phone use soon became a matter for the FBI. Mitnick was unaware that an old hacker buddy was now an FBI informant, and after Mitnick called him up, the FBI soon learned that Brian Merrill of Seattle was actually Kevin Mitnick, the wanted fugitive. Mitnick was aware that the feds were closing in, and so, once again, he packed up and got out of town – this time, to Raleigh, North Carolina. But it was no use. The FBI was now able to use his cloned cell phone as a tracking device and they were soon knocking on the door of his Raleigh apartment with a search warrant in hand. Mitnick was hoping his fake identity might hold up, but the agents found what they were looking for. In an old ski jacket that he hadn’t worn in years was an old pay slip with the name Kevin Mitnick printed right at the top. After three years on the run, Kevin Mitnick was finally arrested on February 15, 1995. Standing in a North Carolina courtroom to hear the charges being filed against him, Mitnick realized that the feds were going to go after him with everything they had. Every call he made with a cloned cell phone came with a maximum sentence of 20 years. And since they had 23 calls on record, he was looking at 460 years in jail. Mitnick had never committed a violent crime, but the feds wanted to make an example out of him and set a precedent that would put fear in the hearts of other hackers. In addition to the cell-phone fraud, they found him in possession of 20,000 credit card numbers and billions of dollars worth of trade secrets, such as the source codes from the mobile-phone companies. Yet Mitnick had never made an attempt to profit from this information; for him, such information was a sort of trophy. But this didn’t seem to matter to the corporations Mitnick had hacked; they demanded $300 million in damages. The prosecutors treated Mitnick like some sort of super villain and the judge even denied Mitnick the right to a bail hearing. This shocked Mitnick’s defense attorney since he’d never heard of a prior case in the history of American law that didn’t include a bail hearing. The judge also denied Mitnick’s right to review the evidence against him since it would mean he’d be near a computer. People outside the courtroom were also shocked by the treatment Mitnick was getting. A “Free Kevin” campaign was quickly launched. Stickers were made, and news articles popped up everywhere to protest the injustice. And it seems that the protesters and pro-Kevin articles made a difference because, soon enough, a much friendlier plea agreement emerged. The damages would be reduced from $300 million to $4,125, he would be forbidden the use of any electronic devices for three years and he’d be put under tight supervision during this time to make sure he cooperated. Mitnick knew that a better offer was unlikely to appear, so he took the deal. By the time all was said and done, Mitnick ended up spending five years in jail. Mitnick found a new life for himself after the trial. It all began with a letter from US Senator Fred Thompson, inviting Mitnick to take part in a Senate hearing on how safe the US government is from cyber attacks. Mitnick agreed to testify and offer his expertise, and soon thereafter he was being bombarded with requests for similar speaking engagements. Obviously, since he was no longer allowed to even check his email, this offered a great opportunity to use his computer savvy to earn a living. He was quickly making the rounds at companies, government agencies, think tanks and television news shows, speaking his mind and offering advice. The Hollywood producer and director J.J. Abrams, who was an active supporter of the Free Kevin movement, even gave him a cameo role on his TV show Alias. (His character was, ironically, not a hacker, but a CIA agent. And to get around the rules of his probation, the prop master made sure his keyboard was disconnected.) So Mitnick was experiencing something of a celebrity moment, which is a bit unusual for a convicted criminal who is still being closely monitored. Mitnick was well aware of the fortunate turn his life had taken, and he was eager to keep it going by finding work as a technology consultant and writer. Thankfully, his parole officer agreed to allow him use of a laptop, so long as it wasn’t connected to the internet, to write his first book, The Art of Deception. The book was an instant bestseller in 2002, even in Poland, where it outperformed a book by the Polish-born Pope John Paul II. Mitnick has found that consultancy work suits him perfectly. It lets him do what he’s spent his entire life training for: ethical hacking. Companies around the world pay Mitnick to hack into their systems and advise them on how to improve their security measures. It’s a dream come true. The key message in this book: Kevin Mitnick is among the world’s most notorious hackers. But unlike many others, he never used his talents with phones and computers as a way to make personal gains. He did it all for the thrill, not unlike a magician performing a seemingly impossible escape routine. The law finally caught up with Mitnick, but it was probably the best thing that could have happened to him. He is now a free man, no longer living in fear, and able to help companies improve their online security by doing what he’s best at – finding a company’s weak spot. Got feedback?

Thanks to the latest, state of the art gene technology you can reduce the chances that your child will develop Alzheimer's disease, certain types of cancer and heart disease later in life. You can even choose traits which will influence your offspring’s height, IQ and personality type. This scenario might sound like science fiction, but it could soon be reality. Thanks to recent leaps in technology and a better understanding of the human genome, we will be able to play an increasingly active role in designing our future offspring. Welcome to the genetic revolution. In these blinks, you’ll survey the history of evolutionary biology and genetics, spanning from Darwinian evolutionary theory to the latest in gene technology. In these blinks, you’ll learn why a genetically altered baby is no more unnatural than a vaccinated one; how you might soon be able to change your skin color to blue; and how developments in genetic engineering could mean the end of hereditary disease. When combating fruit flies in your kitchen, it may seem hard to believe that these annoying little creatures are related to you. But, in fact, 700 million years ago, a mutual ancestor of humans and fruit flies roamed the planet. Had you told someone this two hundred years ago, you would have been called a heretic. At that time, most people believed that humans were magically put on Earth by God along with all other creatures and that they had always been the same. This assumption was challenged when Charles Darwin published his classic On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859. Based on years of meticulous research from his voyage around the world, Darwin posited that all life on Earth is related. Small, inherited variations in traits enabled populations to compete to survive and reproduce in a process which he called natural selection. In other words, populations evolved since species with more advantageous traits survived and reproduced more than those with less advantageous traits. Today, most scientists agree that the first single-cell organisms emerged 3.8 billion years ago. Around 540 million years ago, mutations among organisms skyrocketed, exploding into diverse ecosystems of plants and animals. Our species, Homo Sapiens, emerged around 300 thousand years ago. Human traits have been so advantageous that we have survived and multiplied across the planet. In the process, we have outcompeted other species, such as our Neanderthal cousins, to extinction. Darwin understood the big picture of evolution. But it was one of his contemporaries who took the first steps in understanding how our biological heritage actually works. By studying the traits passed down to the offspring of over ten thousand pea plants, the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel found that a plant’s traits are formed by pairs of genes inherited from each parent plant. Mendel posited that individual traits are passed on independently of other traits. In cases where the two genes in a pair are different, one gene will always be dominant. That meant that an offspring’s genes are inherited as distinct units rather than being a perfect blend of its parents’ genetic makeup. Together, Darwinian evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics turned the tide in biology. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at how we are entering a new era beyond natural selection. Darwinian evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics began an unprecedented age of biotechnical progress. At the heart of this progress is our understanding of genetics. So let’s start with some basics. Our genetic code is made up of pairs of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, molecules stacked in a sequence that forms a double helix. There are four kinds of nucleotides, or DNA molecules, commonly known by their first letter: G, A, T, or C. Each pair of nucleotides contains one molecule inherited from our mother and one inherited from our father. The sequence in which these molecules are strung together form unique units of genetic code known as genes.  Usually formed by sets of 23 base pairs, or nucleotide pairs, genes contain instructions for our cells to produce proteins, the building blocks of our body. These instructions determine everything from our eye color to how our skin is produced. In total, humans have roughly 21,000 genes and 3.2 billion base pairs. With the discovery of the genetic code, scientists knew the language of human life. However, they didn’t know how to read it. That is, until the mid-1970s when Frederick Sanger and Alan Coulson found a way to sequence a cell’s genome – or, determine its genetic code in its entirety – using machine technology. Advances in automating this process planted the seed for a more ambitious project. Launched in 1990, The Human Genome Project was a 2.7 billion dollar international effort to sequence the first human genome. By the time the project was completed thirteen years later, private efforts had also propelled the field of genome sequencing forward. Since then, the technology has not only evolved, it’s also become a lot less expensive. The cost of sequencing a full human genome has fallen from $100 million in 2001 to around just $700 today. With both private and government-led efforts to collect data, such as the 100,000 Genomes Project in England or the recent launch of the All of Us Research Program in the United States, it’s predicted that two billion human genomes will be sequenced over the next ten years. That means scientists have another challenge on their hands – making sense of all that data. Some traits, like eye color or diseases like cystic fibrosis, which are expressed in single gene mutations have been relatively straightforward to identify. But for the most part, the human genome functions in complex ways that we have yet to understand. That’s where artificial intelligence, or AI, and big-data analytics come in. In the past two years, revolutionary developments in both fields have enabled scientists to apply these tools to the field of genomics. Among other efforts, Google and the Chinese company WuXi NextCODE have released AI-driven genome sequencing technology. These databases synthesize genomic information and run algorithms to analyze patterns. The hope is to identify specific genes and further our understanding of the human genome. We are beginning to understand our genetic code as a kind of information technology. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at the technological developments that allow us to hack it. Even with the help of AI technology, we are only at the beginning of solving the secrets of the human genome. Nonetheless, scientists have made groundbreaking progress in the realm of reproductive technologies. Reproductive technology can be as simple as preventing reproduction between two carriers of a recessive disease. Take Tay-Sachs, a recessive genetic disorder carried by around four percent of Ashkenazi Jews. Affected children suffer a painful death through the slow destruction of their nerve cells. By avoiding reproduction between two carriers who test positive through genome sequencing, the Orthodox Jewish community has effectively eliminated Tay-Sachs from the population since the genetic mutation for the disease was identified in 1985. Genome sequencing had even greater implications with the inception of embryo selection. On July 21, 1978, Louise Brown was born – the first baby conceived through in vitro fertilization, or IVF, meaning that the mother’s egg was fertilized outside of the mother. Soon after, scientists wondered whether they could sequence an IVF embryo’s genome before inserting it into the mother’s womb. In 1990, doctors executed the first successful PGD or preimplantation genetic diagnosis procedure, screening an IVF embryo to determine its gender, as well as single-gene mutation disorders such as Huntington’s disease and spinal muscular atrophy. PGD is now grouped under a broader category of preimplantation genetic testing, or PGT. Whereas terminating a pregnancy can be devastating and physically dangerous, PGT combined with IVF can ensure that offspring are healthy before they’re implanted into mothers’ bodies. Up to fifteen embryos can be screened, depending on how many eggs are extracted from the mother. As our understanding of genome indicators for traits and diseases grows, we will be able to scan for even more diseases, including cancer. That’s only the start of embryo selection. Within ten years, we’ll be able to screen for traits such as height, intelligence and personality. Since hundreds of genes make up complex traits like IQ, embryo selection for these complex traits will likely elicit a probability, rather than a binary option. In other words, you’ll be able to select that your child will have a 70 percent likelihood of being tall. In some nations, selecting embryos for preferable traits is already becoming accepted. Though illegal in countries including the United Kingdom and China, selecting an offspring’s gender already accounts for 9 percent of PGT procedures in the United States. As we’ll see in the next blink, it won’t be long before advanced reproductive technologies become the norm. People tend to be dogmatic about what qualifies as “natural.” That’s why most people are hesitant when it comes to the idea of conceiving babies in a lab. But when you look at the world, you’ll realize that we have been manipulating nature for our own advancement for thousands of years. Take vaccines. They have been embraced in spite of the seemingly shocking idea of injecting your child with a virus and the risks of having an allergic reaction. Assisted reproduction technology will be no different. Currently, IVF makes up around 1.5 percent of all births in the United States. It has been embraced by older women and mothers with high risks of hereditary diseases and has allowed same-sex couples to have a biological child. But the author predicts that IVF will soon be adopted by the mainstream, surpassing sex as humanity’s primary method of reproduction by around 2045. As IVF and PGT grow to circumvent more and more genetic mutations, prospective parents will increasingly opt to give their children the best chance for a healthy life. If type 1 diabetes or cancer become avoidable, for example, it’s easy to imagine a future in which conceiving through sex will be as stigmatized as opposing vaccinations is today. Future parents won’t be the only agents favoring assisted reproductive technology however. Governments and insurance companies will promote IVF and embryo selection to eliminate the expenses of preventable genetic diseases. Right now, an IVF procedure costs between $12,000 and $30,000 in the United States. If the technology becomes cheaper than treating these diseases, healthcare providers will be incentivized to cover the procedure. Still, IVF has some very obvious downsides. Some women will want to opt out of the difficult and painful process of having one’s eggs extracted. On top of that, older women using IVF have seen a higher rate of birth abnormalities. Because of this, many younger women have begun freezing their eggs to reduce the risk of birth abnormalities if they choose to use IVF later in life. Companies such as Facebook and Apple have been covering the costs for women to freeze their eggs since 2014. Though initially criticized as a maneuver to keep workers from taking maternity leave, the offer has since been lauded for giving women more career choices. Embryo selection enables prospective parents to select their future offspring based on the genetic makeup of the embryo. But developments in gene editing suggest that in the future, rather than just choosing an embryo, you’ll be able to manipulate your embryo’s genetic code. Though it has been around since the 1980s, gene-editing is more precise and affordable than ever. This is thanks to the development of the 2010 CRISPR system, which uses bacteria to cut DNA in precise locations, like tiny molecular scissors. In 2015, scientists in China used CRISPR to alter genes in an unimplanted embryo to prevent the development of a severe blood disorder. In 2017, a team in the United States successfully altered defected sperm cells to prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which reduces the heart’s ability to pump blood. Advanced research into gene-editing will lead us into an era of genetic manipulation that goes far beyond healthcare. In Japan, for example, scientists have already used gene-editing to make purple flowers white. With today’s research into injecting human embryos with human or animal DNA, it won’t be long before people can choose skin colors from any color of the rainbow. In the very distant future, we might be able to give humans enhanced dog-like hearing, or eagle vision. Advances in gene-editing have also led to breakthroughs in gene therapy for adults. CAR-T therapy, a gene therapy for cancer, gained media attention when 83 percent of the patients in its early clinical trials saw their cancer go into remission. The technology works by extracting blood cells from the body and genetically engineering T cells, a type of white blood cell. Once inserted back into the body, the engineered blood cells fight cancer. But scientists aren’t only working toward editing our genes. Progress in the field of synthetic biology suggests that we’ll one day be able to write them from scratch. In 2010, the American scientist Craig Venter created the world’s first synthetic cell by replicating the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides in an empty bacteria shell. In the future, scientists might write genetic code for new traits that don’t even exist yet, like heat-resistant skin, in order to survive radiation, a hotter planet or space travel. Technically speaking, the possibilities for genetic engineering are infinite. The more critical question is how humanity will respond to them. Cultural diversity is part of what makes humanity so special. Unfortunately, it also often leads to conflict. This is especially true when it comes to new technologies. Just look at genetically modified (GM) crops. Studies across the board have revealed that GM crops are as safe to eat as traditional crops. In America and China, farmers have adopted GM seeds to yield more crops using fewer pesticides. But fearmongering led by anti-GMO activists, who see GM crops as dangerous, led to their being banned by seventeen countries in the EU. The issues surrounding GM food production illustrate how humanity might clash over the regulation of genetic engineering. So far, polls on genetic engineering in the United States reflect that Americans are in favor of manipulating genes to prevent diseases, as well as genetic alterations that would protect their children from harm. But ideological differences will be inevitable. The Jewish community adopted genetic engineering to combat Tay-Sachs. Some Jewish scholars have argued that the participation of Jews in clinical trials for mitochondrial replacement therapy, which could lead to genetically altering offspring, is chesed, or an act of kindness, for the betterment of humanity. However, the Catholic Church has formally denounced both embryo-selecting and gene-editing research. As a result, PGT, the prenatal testing of IVF embryos, is illegal in Catholic-leaning countries such as Austria and Chile. And that’s just one example of how legislative approaches to assisted reproduction are already playing out on a global scale. In the United States, legislation for advanced reproduction technologies is almost non-existent. In Europe, the lack of EU-wide regulation means that people in Austria could easily travel to a neighboring country where regulation is less restrictive. In the end, even the most reluctant views on genetic modification won’t be able to stop the genetic revolution. That’s because human competition will cause a genetic arms race. Let’s look at this in the next blink. For years, Russia and China have secretly sponsored doping athletes for international competitions like the Olympics. Not long from now, these and other countries will be able to edit the genes in adult athletes. This will technically be cheating. But, as it will be difficult to determine whether someone has been genetically edited or not, curtailing how genetics will be used in international sporting competitions presents serious challenges. In the United States, parents can already check the athletic aptitude of their children through genomic tests. Uzbekistan’s national sports program has incorporated genetic testing since 2014. China recently announced that the selection process for the 2022 Winter Olympics will include genetic sequencing. But athletic competition is only a fragment of how competition is driving an international genetic arms race. Leading the race are the United States and China. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared his desire for China to become the dominant power in global technology, and China has made aggressive efforts to understand the human genome. Although research facilities in the United States are superior, stalled developments in a national development plan and major budget cuts to science under the Trump administration have helped China take center stage. More than an agenda to better humankind, the genetic arms race is about power. In the long run, countries who opt out of genetic engineering will risk falling behind as citizens in other nations around the world become taller, smarter and more resilient to global climate disasters. But if certain countries take this too far, for example by genetically altering an armed force to be strong and aggressive, it could easily lead to genetic warfare. Whether we like it or not, the future of humanity will be shaped by genetic engineering. Though we have no option but to embrace these technologies, considering their ethical implications is necessary to prevent the worst case scenario. Will the universal adoption of embryo selection lead to a homogenous monoculture? Or will genetic enhancements result in new class hierarchies? And how will we treat parents who decide not to engage in genetic engineering? These are just a few of the ethical questions we must face as we march forward into the genetic era. One of the most pressing concerns about reproductive technologies is diversity. The future of humanity will depend on diversity for survival, as it has for the entirety of our evolution. Genetic alterations that shift sexual orientation or skin color to fit a certain social bias would be socially devastating. More concerning, since we can’t predict for certain what the demands of our future world will be, interfering with our evolutionary processes could accidentally kill off our species. Ensuring that we won’t end up with a homogenous monoculture in the future requires that we work to celebrate diversity in the world around us, from our different skin colors to personality types. Similarly, in order to prevent inequality fostered by genetic engineering, we need to address issues of inequality in the world today. It’s not difficult to imagine that the genetically enhanced will be favored by employers and even have a better chance at survival. Parents who can afford it will go to great lengths to ensure that their child isn’t left behind. In a nightmare scenario, governments could even breed a superhuman class to rule over a class of servants. There is no question that inequality between the genetically enhanced and the unenhanced should remain an urgent concern. But the truth is that we already live in a world of immense inequality. In some cases, this already created genetic inequality. Studies have found that in the Central African Republic, malnutrition has resulted in children with lower cognitive abilities on a genetic level compared to children in other countries. Tomorrow’s solutions for genetic inequality will likely depend on how we collectively approach this issue today. At the same time, suggesting that we shouldn’t tamper with our genetics in the name of diversity or equality would be unreasonable. Doing so would be giving up the potential for these technologies to cure fatal diseases and ultimately prove futile in light of international competition. Ethical concerns are only one potential pitfall of genetic engineering. Terrorists could also use gene-editing to create harmful pathogens to use as weapons. Even unintentionally, the introduction of genetically altered organisms could wipe out whole ecosystems. We need to create national and international institutions to determine the regulation of genetic engineering going forward. People will argue that setting up an international infrastructure around genetics is not an urgent matter. But just look at our past attempts to create international bodies for regulating potentially devastating technologies. Ratified in 1970, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has prevented a global nuclear crisis but has failed to prevent the United States and Russia from possessing nuclear weapons or countries like North Korea and Israel from acquiring them. International regulation is often a chaotic and conflict-ridden process. Apart from regulation, the future of humanity will depend on public education so people can develop informed opinions on these technologies. Every country should devise a public-education program, a bioethics commission and its own regulatory framework. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority is setting the bar for how new reproductive technologies might best be regulated. Public education on advanced reproductive technologies has resulted in increased approval of genetic selecting and engineering amongst the British population. Even genetic engineering for capability enhancements, such as increased intelligence, has a 40 percent approval rate. And while creating an international regulatory body will be complicated, setting up a framework for global dialogue could be relatively simple. We should devise a commission made up of scientists, intellectuals and religious leaders to answer crucial concerns ranging from the treatment of diseases through technologies to the standards of a global regulatory body. Until then, we don’t need to wait for national or international agents to take action. It will be up to each of us to educate ourselves, our peers and our communities about our genetic future. The key message in these blinks: As AI and big-data analytics lead to more discoveries about the human genome, our increased ability to use advanced reproductive technologies to cure hereditary diseases will lead us into a new era of screening, altering and writing genetic code. The parental instinct to protect offspring and international competition will lead to the universal adoption of these technologies. It is up to individuals, nations and the international community to create educational and regulatory bodies and ensure that the genetic revolution leads to a brighter future. Got feedback?

We generally associate this concept with abstract, large-scale processes and movements. What’s often missing, however, are the personal stories of the people who define our increasingly interconnected world. Few biographies capture the realities of a globe-spanning life better than that of Satya Nadella. From a youth spent dreaming of cricketing stardom in the 1980s in India to his meteoric rise through the ranks of Microsoft in the US, Nadella’s story is a fascinating thumbnail sketch of the world we live in today. But it’s also a deeply intimate portrait of a fascinating individual. As Nadella himself likes to point out, his business acumen and leadership skills are rooted in everyday life. Whether it’s on the cricket field or as a father raising a disabled son, his way of seeing things has always reflected his personal experiences. In the following blinks, you’ll learn what businesspeople can learn from cricketers; why empathy is so important to leadership; and why automation doesn’t necessarily mean a jobless future. Nadella was born in Hyderabad, India, in 1967. His father was a civil servant, and his mother was a scholar of Sanskrit, the ancient language of many of the country’s religious texts. As a young boy, however, Nadella wasn’t interested in politics or religion. What he really cared about was cricket. But his parents had other ideas for him. In fact, his father even hung a poster of Karl Marx in his son’s room in the hope of inspiring him to become a great economist and intellectual. His mother responded with a poster of the Indian goddess of fortune and prosperity, which she hoped would remind him of the value of spiritual contentment. Nadella wasn’t having any of it. His favorite poster? A blown-up image of the Hyderabadi cricket star ML Jaisimha! Nadella’s love affair with the sport gradually became a source of real concern. What, his parents wondered, would he do if his dream of becoming a professional cricketer didn’t come to anything? The answer Nadella came up with was banking. His father wasn’t happy with that either, however, and told him one day, “You’ve got to get out of Hyderabad. Otherwise, you’ll ruin yourself.” That got Nadella thinking. At 18, he dusted off his old Sinclair ZX Spectrum personal computer – a gift his father had given him three years earlier. As he played around with the gadget, his thoughts increasingly turned to engineering, software and the great potential of personal computing. He enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology to study electrical engineering and graduated in 1988. It was during his studies that Nadella’s dream of playing cricket professionally finally came to an end. At Manipal, he fell in with a group of entrepreneurial peers whose passion was positively infectious. After a single match for the Manipal college team, Nadella hung his cricketing gear up for good and decided to devote himself to a career in technology. After completing his studies at Manipal, Nadella found himself at a crossroads. His two options were to either stay in his comfort zone of his native India or follow his father’s advice and move on in search of greener pastures. Initially, the choice seemed easy. As a young man, Nadella was deeply influenced by his mother’s spiritual philosophy, which held that it was always best to do your own thing in your own time. So without any pressure to shoot for the stars, he was inclined to accept the offer he had received from a good Bombay university for a place in its master’s program. But that’s not what fate had in store for him. Contrary to his expectations, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee also offered him a place in its computer science program. Expecting little, Nadella duly filed his visa application – the chances of receiving a visa as an Indian were pretty slim. But then the news came that he’d been granted the visa. That was surely a sign! Accepting that he now had no way out, in 1988, he began packing as many sweaters as he could lay his hands on and prepared for the move to chilly Wisconsin. After settling in, Nadella became ever more interested in theoretical computer science. The question that occupied him was finding out the limits of what computers could do. In his dissertation, he looked at an aspect of computational complexity theory called graph coloring – the area of computer science concerned with assigning labels to graphs within certain constraints. To get an idea of how that works, imagine coloring the 50 states of the US in such a way that no two bordering states have the same color. Graph coloring is all about figuring out the minimum number of colors necessary in such a scenario, and Nadella became obsessed with solving these sorts of problems in fast and effective ways. Nadella graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1990. His career at Microsoft was about to begin. Nadella first set foot on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington, in the fall of 1992. There was a buzz around the place. Work on Windows 95, the largest consumer technology product ever to be developed, was well underway. Bill Gates was still unknown to the wider public, but it was clear that something huge was about to happen. Nadella arrived just in time to see the project bear its first fruits. Nadella was recruited to work on the Windows NT operating system. His job was to travel the country convincing customers – usually companies – to switch to Windows NT. While he was excited at the prospect of helping get the new system off the ground, Nadella also had other plans. He wanted to go to business school. His opportunity came when he was offered a place on the University of Chicago’s MBA program. But there was a catch: Nadella didn’t want to jeopardize his position at Microsoft. So he kept his enrollment in the part-time course secret, worked a regular five-day week in Redmond and flew to Chicago every weekend! This gamble paid off. Looking back, Nadella regards these two years as incredibly formative. Not only had he been intimately involved in the launch of an exciting new operating system, but he had also honed his strategy and leadership skills. What he learned over the course of the MBA laid the foundations for his rapid rise through the ranks of Microsoft later on. By 1994, Nadella had successfully completed his MBA and received his first managerial project – overseeing the development of the “Tiger Server,” a revolutionary video-on-demand or VOD service. More than a decade before the arrival of Netflix, Microsoft was already developing the technology that would make it possible. This was also Nadella’s first taste of leadership. Even better, his hard work and dedication were beginning to make an impression. It was around this time that he received one of Steve Ballmer’s famous high-fives. That was a promising sign. Being noticed by Ballmer, who would later become Microsoft’s second CEO in 2000, suggests he already had his feet firmly on the first rung of the company’s career ladder! In January 2011, Steve Ballmer asked Nadella to take the lead on Microsoft’s new cloud technology project, “Server and Tools Business” or STB. Cloud technology was already a multi-billion dollar business by this point, but the largest slice of the pie had been gobbled up by Amazon. Nadella’s task? Reversing this and getting Microsoft into pole position. It was an incredibly ambitious project that would require excellent management skills. But before we get to that, let’s take a closer look at cloud technology. Essentially, it’s a distributed computing system – it relies on a network of servers. That’s important because relying on a single server ends up crashing the whole system.   To see why that’s the case, imagine a search engine receiving thousands of different questions every second. If the engine were hosted on a single server, it’d quickly break down. Cloud computing solves that problem. It’s only when you distribute the computational work over a network of servers that something like a widely used search engine becomes feasible. That’s what makes cloud technology such a breakthrough. And that’s where Nadella came in. His job was to optimize Microsoft’s products and technology to create a hybrid solution for people who wanted both a private on-premise server and a publically accessible cloud. So how did he go about doing this? Well, his priority was to establish a sense of trust and group cohesion in his team. These things were sorely missing when Nadella took charge. Each leader was isolated from the next, and communication between them had broken down entirely. Nadella began by sitting down with each of them and asking them to talk about their concerns and issues. That simple act laid the foundations for a much more open and trusting working atmosphere. The results of Nadella’s approach spoke for themselves. Within six years, Microsoft’s cloud technology was worth an astonishing $20 billion. Nadella might have given up on his boyhood dreams of becoming a professional cricketer, but the game continued to inspire him during his career at Microsoft. In fact, it was cricket that taught him the three principles by which he continues to live. Rule number one is to compete when intimidated. As a teenager playing on his school cricket team, Nadella came up against an unfamiliar team, featuring several burly Australians. As they warmed up, Nadella and his teammates watched their opponents with awe. They wondered how on earth they were going to beat them. Their coach wasn’t having any of it. He placed Nadella right next to one of these powerful Australians and told him to observe his batting technique. Sure enough, he realized this player had strengths and weaknesses. It was a memorable lesson, and Nadella has never forgotten the importance of pushing past his sense of awe for opponents and simply competing! Rule two is simple – always put your team first. Nadella used to play with a wonderfully gifted bowler whose talents outshone the rest of the team. After being replaced by another bowler during a game, this talented individual decided to boycott the game. When the ball came to him, he sunk his hands into his pockets and made a show of ignoring it. Needless to say, the team suffered. The lesson? Raw talent just doesn’t cut it if you’re not prepared to work with others – success is all about being a team player. Rule three: get to know your teammates and play to their strengths. That’s something Nadella learned during a game in which his bowling was below par. Noticing that Nadella’s confidence was sagging, the captain took charge. He wasn’t a particularly great bowler, but he kept at it until he got a wicket. At that point, he handed the ball back to Nadella. It was a sign of trust that gave Nadella a much-needed boost, and he went on to take a further seven wickets! Applying these three rules to the world beyond the cricket field has made Nadella the successful leader he is today. That just goes to show, the most important lessons in life often come from unlikely sources! Nadella’s son Zain was born in August 1996. His arrival changed the lives of his parents forever. Like cricket, fatherhood has taught Nadella an invaluable lesson – some of life’s problems just don’t have an easy fix. Zain suffered from “asphyxia in utero,” an absence of oxygen in the womb that left him with lifelong disabilities. After his birth, Nadella and his wife Anu experienced months of anxious visits to intensive care units, touch-and-go surgeries and endless sleepless nights. It was a tough time, but it left Nadella with a greater appreciation for the preciousness of life and the beauty in difference. At his first annual speech as the CEO of Microsoft, Nadella spoke about Zain and his two other children. He told his audience how much he’d learned while trying to accommodate their varying needs, and how fatherhood had made him more empathetic – a quality that also changed his approach to business. That’s hardly surprising – with Zain’s birth, the personal and professional overlapped. All those visits to hospitals gave Nadella a newfound appreciation of how technology can improve and save lives. One visit to an intensive care unit in 2014 shortly after taking up his position as CEO of Microsoft stood out. As he entered the ward, Nadella noticed how many of the machines buzzing and beeping away in the background were run on Windows. It was cloud technology that allowed the hospital to care for his son! It was a startling revelation. Nadella remembers being overcome by a sense of responsibility. Lives depended on his work at Microsoft, and it was his duty to get things right. Nadella soon became more attuned to how cloud technology can be used to improve the lives of people around the world. One start-up, for example, uses the technology to create a solar grid for rural Kenyans living on less than $2 a day. That not only gives them access to affordable electricity but also allows them to replace dangerous kerosene-fuelled generators. Even better, the project allows its users to develop a credit-rating, thus giving them access to sources of credit! On February 4, 2014, Nadella followed in the footsteps of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer to become Microsoft’s third CEO. It was a considerable achievement, but there was a problem – the company that he was now in charge of was struggling. Why? The consensus at the time was that Microsoft just wasn’t as innovative as it had been in the past. People were swapping their PCs for smartphones, and Android and Apple operating systems were gradually pushing Microsoft out of the market. The view within the company wasn’t any better. In fact, in the annual employees’ poll, a majority stated that they believed Microsoft was heading in the wrong direction and questioned the company’s ability to innovate. The figures underscored such concerns. After decades of healthy growth, the number of worldwide PC shipments began to stall as the smartphone revolution continued. In 2013, 70 million PCs were shipped every quarter, compared to an astonishing 350 million smartphones – a reversal which would have been unimaginable ten years earlier. And because every PC sold brings in royalties for Microsoft, the company’s bottom line was also taking a hit. Nadella had his work cut out for him. So how did he approach the daunting task of returning Microsoft to its old position as the undisputed king of computing? Well, as with his first managerial challenge of overseeing the company’s cloud project, he emphasized a sense of unity. On July 10, 2016, Nadella sent every employee an email containing his manifesto for Microsoft’s future. As he wrote in that message, “We must all understand and embrace what only Microsoft can contribute to the world and how we can once again change the world.” The way to start doing that, he argued, was to adapt. That meant ditching nostalgia for the old days in which the PC market was booming and tackling people’s current needs, above all their difficulties in managing the growing sea of apps, social networks and devices. To do that, Nadella realized, Microsoft would have to learn to listen to its customers. Hoping to expedite that process, he organized customer visits during the company’s annual retreat. On the first day, dozens of different teams met up with pupils, students, teachers, administrators and managers from schools, universities, hospitals and corporations. It was an effective strategy – after all, the only way you can help someone solve a problem is if you know what the problem is! One of Microsoft’s greatest challenges is to deal with competitors like Apple, Google and Amazon. The traditional approach would be to show no mercy in an all-out business war. But that’s not the path Nadella chose. Instead, he chose to reach out to his company’s rivals and work together. That, he believes, doesn’t just benefit Microsoft – it also benefits the world. Nadella first offered the metaphorical peace pipe to Apple shortly after taking up his position as CEO in 2014. At an annual Salesforce marketing event, Nadella pulled an iPhone out of his pocket and began talking about its unique features. The audience was stunned. No wonder –  it was the first time a Microsoft CEO had ever shown off an Apple product in this way! So, what on earth was he up to? Well, the answer could be found in a close-up of Nadella’s phone, projected onto a giant screen. This wasn’t any old iPhone. As Nadella demonstrated, it was a smartphone running Microsoft software on Apple’s signature operating system iOS. Combining the two, Nadella argued, would create great synergy. Users could keep their phones and their favorite Microsoft programs like Outlook, Skype and Word, as well as a ton of new apps like OneNote and OneDrive. Burying the hatchet with one of Microsoft’s greatest rivals was a savvy move, but it took time to establish enough trust for the relationship to really blossom. When Nadella took charge of Microsoft, for example, he announced that the company was working on developing Office for iOS. After initial skepticism, Apple responded by asking Microsoft to help it optimize Office for its new iPad Pro. Over time, wariness gave way to something closer to friendship. But, as Apple itself noted, what really kickstarted the two tech giants’ collaboration was Microsoft’s newfound openness. And that’s a great example of how Nadella helped the company rediscover its soul. After all, Microsoft was a partnership between Paul Allen – a hardware developer – and Bill Gates – a software developer – in the very beginning! People around the world are anxious about the direction the global economy seems to be moving in. Their biggest worry is the effect of new technologies on the labor market. As outsourcing and automation become ever more common, workers are increasingly concerned about the prospect of a jobless future. The real problem, according to some experts, isn’t automation itself but the fact that there are more jobs automated out of existence than jobs being created. That’s the view of MIT economist Daron Acemoglu, a special advisor to Microsoft on economic affairs, who argues for a more balanced approach. Eliminating menial, poorly paid jobs can be a boon, but only if more rewarding, better-paid positions replace them. If those two processes aren’t in sync, however, the result is lower employment. That’s also Nadella’s opinion. As far as he’s concerned, companies must take responsibility and ensure that they create new skilled jobs when they automate others. One example of a business doing exactly that comes from Manning, South Carolina. In 2017, local bicycle company Kent International decided to move 140 jobs back to the US from China. The reason the firm was able to do that was simple – automating jobs that had previously been done by humans had sunk manufacturing costs and allowed the company to move its production plant back home. And even though it had outsourced jobs, it also created new jobs in the US. Today, the company plans on creating 40 new positions every year – not bad in a town as small as Manning! As one manager at Kent International put it, “a lot of people have the misconception that automation decreases jobs. It’s just a different type of job, a more skilled job.” Ultimately, Nadella encourages businesses to take a responsible approach to automation. While the disappearance of menial jobs may cheapen production, businesses have a corporate responsibility to ensure that automation doesn’t lead to mass unemployment. The key message in these blinks: Nadella’s journey began in Hyderabad, India, where he spent his youth devoted to cricket. After falling in with an entrepreneurially-minded set of peers at college, his priorities began to change. Increasingly fascinated by new computing technologies, he took a leap of faith and traveled to the US to continue his education. His dedication and empathetic leadership skills soon put him on the path to his current position as the third CEO of Microsoft.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The incredible speeds at which computers can crunch numbers and solve problems is astounding – and that’s only the beginning. Yet we’re seemingly still a long way from conscious computers, or robots that are genuinely creative or that possess free will. Or are we? In these blinks, you’ll learn the basics about how the human brain works and processes information – and quickly understand that there’s no reason to think that a powerful computer couldn’t do the same, at least in theory. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the smallest whiff of perfume can unearth a wealth of memories; how you brush your teeth elucidates how your brain handles information; and when exactly artificial intelligence will become as commonplace as the washing machine. Memory is a curious thing. You might not think about an event for what seems like years, but a small, sudden detail – like the smell of your grandma’s cookies – brings a moment back with amazing clarity. Interestingly, this phenomenon tells us a lot about how information is organized in the brain. The brain stores and organizes information according to patterns. Think, for example, of the last time you were walking down a sidewalk. How many details can you remember of this trip? Could you describe even a single person who might have passed you by? Such common details can be hard to visualize. However, with the help of certain techniques, a sequence of memories can be coaxed back. Police sketch artists, for example, show a person a collection of varying facial features to help trigger and recover memories. Because the brain stores information as a sequence of patterns, seeing a similar set of eyebrows could help a person recall the rest – in this case, a face. Triggers like this occur all the time. The things you see, smell or otherwise experience with your senses (like grandma’s cookies) can unlock memories from ages ago. Countless memory techniques are based on this pattern principle: if you can get your hands on just one piece of a pattern, the rest of the sequence will reveal itself. Some simple thought experiments show exactly how the brain retrieves information. You can no doubt recite the alphabet. But can you say it backwards? In theory, this should be a simple task. Your brain has all the information it needs, stored away somewhere. However, accessing that information any other way than from A to Z is challenging! Similarly, it’s difficult to play a piece of music you’ve memorized if you start not at the beginning but at some point in the middle. This is because the brain stores information in sequential order. Thus starting out of order feels “unnatural,” and the brain struggles to put the pieces together.  The neocortex is the brain’s outermost layer and accounts for the majority of its mass. Its size is unique to modern human beings. The neocortex is responsible for many important brain functions, such as object recognition, language comprehension and body control. The brain’s neocortex stores and organizes information hierarchically. This makes sense, as everything we do, including thinking, can be broken down into hierarchies and patterns. To illustrate this, think of the steps involved in the process of getting ready for bed. Most likely, your first step is to brush your teeth. But within this step, there are other steps: putting toothpaste on the toothbrush, actually brushing, rinsing with water and so on.  Your brain stores these steps-within-steps in cortical columns, or uniformly organized groupings of neurons found in the neocortex. There are about 500,000 such columns in the neocortex, each containing about 60,000 neurons. Within each cortical column are pattern recognizers, comprising of about 100 neurons. All in all, there are approximately 300 million pattern recognizers in the neocortex. Some of these are low-level recognizers that fire whenever certain pieces of a pattern are present. This information then flows to the higher-level recognizers, which put the pieces together. For example, when you look at a word, low-level recognizers will fire when they see the lines and shapes that distinguish individual letters. High-level recognizers then detect the combinations of letters that create a complete word. Our senses constantly receive input, and this input is compared with past experiences and patterns. To keep up, the brain’s recognizers fire continuously! Thanks to pattern recognition, your brain can usually predict what a thing is even if you see only a small part of it – and even if it’s something you’ve never seen before! Like any good manager, the neocortex is a proficient networker. Depending on the task, it cooperates with other parts of the brain to get a job done.  Whenever we see, hear, touch or smell an object, the sensory information we receive starts its journey in the sensory cortex and moves through the thalamus before reaching the neocortex. Located in the midbrain, the thalamus plays a part in the instinctive reaction as to whether a sensation, like a touch or taste, is pleasing or displeasing, before that information is passed to the parts of the neocortex called the insula. The thalamus and neocortex are in constant communication. In fact, this communication is so critical that a person with a damaged thalamus could fall into a coma – or even die.  The neocortex relies on another specialized part of the brain, called the hippocampus, a small region located in each brain hemisphere that tells the neocortex which events to remember. Whenever sensory information reaches the neocortex, the hippocampus decides whether it’s connected to something new or noteworthy, or perhaps a twist on an older sensation. Then the neocortex treats the information accordingly. For example, your hippocampus is important in recognizing new faces, and keeps you on good terms with friends by alerting you if someone has a new haircut. Many symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, such as trouble learning new things, are caused by a damaged hippocampus. When it comes to controlling movement, the neocortex divvies up the work with another part of the brain, called the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for certain instinctual reactions, called basic functions. When you instinctively reach out to catch a rapidly thrown baseball, that’s the cerebellum at work.  The cerebellum is actually a relic of a time when the human neocortex was much smaller. Nowadays, most movement is controlled by the neocortex. Surprisingly, however, refined or graceful movements, such as dancing or penmanship, are still controlled by the cerebellum. To be human is truly fantastic. So fantastic, many think, that quintessentially human experiences and activities, such as creating art, couldn’t possibly be accounted for by purely neurological processes.  But is this really true? As you learned earlier, sensory input from the world travels to the insula, a portion of the brain’s neocortex. And it’s here that spindle cells originate.  These cells are long neurons that connect relatively distant parts of the neocortex. Spindle cells are heavily involved in creating feelings of sadness and anger, or love and sexual desire. The other areas of the neocortex try their best to control these feelings and make sense of them. But excited spindle cells are difficult to tame, as they’re connected to so many different areas of the brain. And this is the reason why people don’t always make the best decisions when in the throes of passion or anger! Similarly, creativity originates directly in the brain’s neocortex. The larger your neocortex, for example, the more profound your creative potential. One of the inherent qualities of the pattern recognizers that make up the neocortex is the ability to create metaphors and to interpret multiple meanings from symbols, a key element of poetry and art. Pattern recognizers fire 100 times a second, allowing your brain to potentially recognize millions of metaphors in a single second. If we were to somehow strengthen the neocortex, it could result in a person becoming more creative. One way to do this in practice, however, is through collaboration. After all, two heads are better than one! In the future, however, we might expand human intelligence by incorporating some kind of nonbiological neocortex, or artificial intelligence. Clearly, modern science has a good grasp on how the brain’s neocortex and other regions create the human mind, as we understand it today. The next blinks will explore how we could apply this knowledge to machines, with the goal of developing true artificial intelligence. Inventors don’t always start from scratch. Sometimes they find inspiration for innovation in nature.  One such bit of inspiration is right between your ears: the brain. If we could create an artificial mind, why not simply develop a “digital” neocortex that emulates the functions of the human brain?  The secret to creating an artificial mind lies in developing systems that learn by themselves – just like the brain’s neocortex. And thanks to one statistical method, this is now becoming possible. Research into artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to the 1930s and 1940s, the early days of computing.  Initially, researchers were daunted; even if they could develop a sufficiently powerful processor, they’d still have to feed it tons of information to create a truly artificial mind. At the time, this was a considerable obstacle. All this changed in the 1980s when scientists started working with a mathematical solution based on probabilities. This method, called the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) after Russian mathematician Andrei Markov, empowers software to learn and become smarter, much like a child.  Software that employs this model learns through pattern recognition. Just as the pattern recognition performed by the brain’s neocortex, HHMM is based on a hierarchical system. First, the software makes a prediction about what will come next in a series of data. For example, if it reads a three-letter word that starts with a T and an H, it might predict that the next letter will be an E, based on its past learning experience. If the prediction is correct, this triggers another prediction in the next level of the hierarchy, that the following word in the series would be a noun. This method is being used today with voice recognition software, for example. What’s more, variations of HHMM-based software are being used by millions of iPhone users when they ask Siri, Apple’s automated assistant, where the nearest restaurant might be. If you’ve ever tried to chat with iPhone’s Siri or any other online bot, you know such software is seldom convincingly human. At least not yet.  But Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are quickly becoming smarter and more autonomous. IBM’s Watson, for example, provides an early look at the possibilities of AI. In 2011, millions of people watched as Watson defeated some of the best contestants on the American game show, Jeopardy! Using a combination of programs, Watson was able to read and comprehend 200 million pages of natural-language documents, including all of Wikipedia. Even the tricky, pun-filled phrasing of the quiz show’s clues didn’t phase the processing power of Watson.  Watson works by combining all possible answers to a question, and then performing a statistical analysis to identify which answer is likeliest to bet the right one.  But what if Watson were instead programmed to grapple with the problems of the world? Could artificial intelligence even develop a consciousness, or free will? Philosophers have long pondered what it means to be conscious. Rene Descartes famously said, “I think, therefore I am.” He essentially meant that so long as a person is aware of having an experience, then that person is also conscious. But what about free will? The concept of free will too is still hotly debated. Indeed, research has shown that the brain actually initiates actions before a person is even aware of the decisions he or she is about to make. It could be the case even that the idea of free will is really more a feeling than a reality. The author argues that when it searches through all that self-attained knowledge, Watson actually is thinking. And if today’s machines can emulate the brain enough to think, future machines could think and perform acts of free will, assuming that free will exists, in a way that will make machines difficult to distinguish from humans.  If we can indeed create true artificial intelligence, when can we expect such machines to be a “normal” part of society?  As it turns out, technology is rapidly catching up with the requirements of AI. The author’s so-called law of accelerating returns describes the predictable, ever-accelerating growth of information technology. Assuming technological development follows this trajectory, in the very near future it will be advanced enough to simulate the human brain. Intel has already begun manufacturing 3D computer chips which effectively circumvent the problem of space on a circuit board by stacking components on top of each other, rather than shrinking them further. The company expects such chips to be an industry standard by the end of the decade. The author estimates that processors required for a digital neocortex would need to be capable of running 1016 calculations per second. Today’s fastest supercomputer in Japan can already perform calculations at this speed. A digital cortex would also need to be able to store around 20 billion bytes of data, assuming it has about 300 million pattern recognizers with 72 bytes of memory each. Again, this is a level of processing power that even average computers today can exceed.  We will soon see convincing examples of AI in 2029, the author claims, and AI will become commonplace in the 2030s. According to the author, all the portrayals of AI in movies and on television - where robots are often treated as conscious beings - has prepared us to welcome conscious artificial intelligence into our lives. The author’s track record for these kinds of predictions inspires confidence that this will indeed be the case. In the 1990s, the author made 147 predictions for 2009 – and only three of those proved to be false!  The key message in this book: If you were to open up your computer and look at all the components, it would be easy to get lost in the complexity. And yet, if you take a step back, you could elegantly describe its functions with a few pages of text and specific formulas. The same can be said for the human brain; and it is this understanding that will bring us closer to the first truly artificial intelligence.

But exactly how much smarter? Smarter than you? No, you might think. And you might very well be right. But what happens when computers start detecting human emotions? And are you quite sure that an emotionally enabled computer wouldn’t kick your ass if you were to battle in the art of storytelling?  Well, these blinks introduce you to some important advances that computers have made in recent decades. And they are not insignificant. However, you’ll also learn about those human skills that, as the title implies, do not even compare to – or cannot be substituted by – those of a computer. Because humans are indeed underrated. In these blinks, you’ll discover what the “Love Machine” is all about; how a computer is able to detect your emotions; why spending hours and hours in front of a screen is a very bad idea; and who is more likely to win the storytelling battle – humans or computers. Wouldn’t it be nice to increase your brain power by 100 percent every two years? Impossible, you say.  But not for computers. According to Moore’s law, IT systems increase their computing power by 100 percent every two years. In the long run, that’s a big increase. For example, Sony’s first transistor radio had five transistors and would barely fit into a pocket. Today, Intel’s latest processor has five billion transistors and it fits in the palm of your hand. So, will computers become infinitely powerful? Not quite. Eventually Moore’s law will end due to sheer physical limitations: you can only fit a finite number of transistors in a certain space. But until that time, you’d better not compare your brain power to a computer. In fact, nowadays computers can surpass us in tasks we usually think are uniquely human. For example, computers can detect emotions more effectively than humans. Paul Ekman, a famous psychologist, discovered micro-expressions: the minimal movements in your 40 facial muscles that lead to certain expressions. After many years of research, Ekman figured out which of 3,000 different micro-expressions is connected to which emotion. The result is his Facial Action Coding System. This is how it works: If you put all this emotional data into a computer equipped with a camera, and point it at a human face, the computer can correctly detect the emotion 85 percent of the time. Whereas humans, even with training, got it right only 55 percent of the time! Have you ever thought about how much your cell phone or tablet affects you?  It turns out that the use of phones, computers and other “screens” decreases our social skills. In today’s world it’s easy to spend hours in front of a screen without even noticing. The problem is that the more time we spend in front of screens, the worse our social skills, like reading body language or understanding emotions, become. In fact, when sixth-graders stayed at a screen-free camp for only five days, researchers found a substantial increase in the children’s emotional understanding. They did two more tests to verify the results, and each time they were statistically significant. But what about social media? Doesn’t that bring us closer? Nope. It turns out that social media isn’t that social after all. Originally, humans evolved to be sociable in order to stay connected to a tribe that could keep us safe and provide us with food.  But today we can maintain connections from our computer at home, and find our food in the fridge. Even though at first glance that seems like a revolutionary development, it’s actually the opposite.  For example, a study showed that US teenagers who use a lot of social media are less likely to have good relationships with their parents or their peers, and are often unhappy. This might be because bonding via social media is less effective than in person or over the phone. Another reason might be that social media users typically become less trusting, so the quality of their relationships suffers. So although computers do improve our lives in many ways, we should be careful when using them, especially since social skills like empathy have become more important – as we’ll see in the next blink. The old saying goes: Knowledge is power. These days though, knowledge is increasingly stored in computers, with little need to keep it your head. So where does this leave us humans? We have to shift our main focus from acquiring knowledge to other uniquely human capabilities – like social skills. Consider a lawyer: She has to possess skills ranging from the ability to analyze a case to figuring out a strategy to support her position: all time- and cost-intensive labor. But today a computer can analyze millions of cases and find all the supporting literature in a bleep. Computers can even predict the outcomes of Supreme Court decisions more accurately than legal experts! So do we no longer need lawyers? We do need them, but their focus is shifting toward skills that computers cannot replace: social skills, like building an emotional connection with a client, and helping them act in their own best interest. But there’s another reason why social skills are becoming ever more crucial. As the world becomes more interconnected, people from different cultures are interacting more and more. One step out of place can be taken as a deep insult – and in the wrong context, it can be deadly. For example, in 2004, during the war in Iraq, an American marine drove too close to the third holiest site in Shia Islam, the Imam Ali Mosque, causing an uproar. If the soldier had known better, they could have avoided the conflict. But when harnessed, social skills can be incredibly powerful. A few weeks earlier, a group of American soldiers was surrounded by hundreds of enraged Iraqis. But instead of attacking them, the soldiers used their knowledge of local culture, and knelt down, pointing their guns to the ground. This simple use of body language calmed the Iraqis down, and the soldiers could withdraw in peace. Have you ever had a bad experience with a call-center person? It’s partly because they typically have to follow rigid scripts instead of having genuine empathy for your problem. We find this irritating because empathy is a basic element for every relationship – even in business. In fact, being empathic – understanding what the other person is feeling – is becoming more important in every area of the economy. Whether you show it as a doctor or a call-center worker, empathy is the first step of every meaningful relationship. For example, consider how American Express is using empathy in business. When Jim Bush was placed in charge of AmEx’s call centers, he threw out all the scripts. Instead, the workers received information about each individual customer, and could act as they personally felt right. This led to higher recommendation scores from customers, higher profit margins and a 50 percent reduction in the employee attrition rate. And the good news about empathy is that it’s a skill everybody can learn that will probably never be replaced by a computer. Empathy consists of two elements: understanding the thoughts and feelings of others, and reacting appropriately. For example, an empathic doctor would try to understand what the patient is going through and show an appropriate level of concern. And this is where we have an advantage over computers. We are hardwired to only accept empathy in its most powerful form from fellow humans, so no matter how elaborately a computer responds to our problems, we simply won’t be convinced. Have you ever worked in a team where things just didn’t click? While everyone in a team can bring great skills to the table, their different personalities may be a bad fit. So what determines the success of a team? While many factors such as size, stability or appropriate rewards do matter, they are not as important as social sensitivity, meaning the social abilities of the subject.  Consider the US golf team in 2008. Their coach, Paul Azinger, wanted to assemble a team that would win the Ryder Cup. In previous years the United States had lost five out of six tournaments because they couldn’t work together as a team. So Azinger tried a new approach: instead of choosing the players with the best skills, he selected those whose personalities would best fit together. He made sure that each golfer felt comfortable and understood in the team. The result? One of the biggest US wins in the past 25 years. F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, “No grand idea was ever born in a conference,” but today he might be wrong. Being able to work together in a group is crucial for the success of any organization. In the world of scientific research, the most influential work is generally conducted by teams. This system allows each member to specialize in specific topics, helping them break into new territory faster. Teamwork is also critical in the business world. In addition to the CEO, there’s usually an entire team running a business, like the chief financial officer (who emerged in the 1970s) and chief information officer (a product of the 1980s), as well as many other coordinating roles. This kind of team composition is essential for success today. We’ve all left the cinema after experiencing a movie with a great plot that has moved us to tears. But did you know that if you can tell a good story like that, you’ll find it’s more convincing for people than a purely logical argument – and can change millions of lives? Consider Stephen Denning, the director of the Africa region at the World Bank. He realized that the World Bank had an incredible amount of information on important subjects like malaria. If this information were made accessible to, for example, Zambian health workers, they could use it to help millions of people.  At first Denning tried to sell his idea to his colleagues with logic, charts and slides, but they didn’t listen. So he tried a new method, and told them the story of a health worker in Zambia logging onto the World Bank’s site to access all the information about malaria.  The problem: the worker couldn’t access the information. So despite the wealth of information that the World Bank possessed, the bank wasn’t actually making any difference. This story led to a change in the World Bank’s strategy, which eventually helped millions of people. Denning used a skill in which humans have a clear advantage over computers: he told a good story. Stories exist to “move people to change,” but a computer-written story will never achieve this because it lacks authenticity. We humans want to know and evaluate the teller of the story, and computer-written stories simply seem suspicious. Even though in recent years computers have been getting better at writing stories, from simple reports on sports matches to more complicated narratives, they still do not beat those of humans. Have you ever made a meal from a recipe devised by a computer? You haven’t? Well, if you get the chance, you should try it! Computers can indeed be creative, and cooking is a great example. IBM taught their supercomputer Watson to be the ultimate creative cook. At first, Watson scanned thousands of existing recipes and all of the food combinations involved, such as tomatoes and oregano. He was also “fed” the chemical profiles of thousands of ingredients. He was then asked to create brand new recipes.  One of the results, the Austrian Chocolate burrito, which included the astonishing combination of ground beef, dark chocolate, mashed edamame, apricot purée and cheese, was sold from a food truck at the South by Southwest festival in Austin – and people loved it. Clearly then, computers can perform creative tasks. But it seems true creative breakthroughs are still generated by human interaction. Consider really creative companies like Apple, Google and Pixar. They actively encourage creativity by increasing “random” interactions between employees – interactions that make the innovation sparks fly. For example, Google serves really good food in their cafeteria. As a result, everybody goes there. When standing in line, people often start talking with someone they wouldn’t normally interact with. There are also long tables instead of small ones, which increases the chances of sitting next to someone unknown.   Then there’s Steve Jobs’ methods: he designed Pixar’s headquarters with one central meeting spot where everyone interacted. And at Apple, he was famous for his face-to-face meetings, which got everyone’s input directly. As you’ve seen in these blinks, humans are still superior to computers in many areas. But it gets even better: computers can also help us to excel.  Take education, for instance: it turns out that learning at a computer is more effective than learning in a crowded classroom. For example, the US Navy uses software to teach students how to repair technical systems on ships, a purely knowledge-based task that doesn’t require any human interaction. Then there’s Stanford University, which in 2011 launched the first MOOC or Massive Open Online Course on artificial intelligence, inviting everyone to follow it from their own homes around the world. Eventually, some 160,000 students from 190 countries registered, but the biggest shock was that the top 400 performers were not the elite students in the parallel classroom course – they were the online participants! Nowadays there are even ways of learning the social skills crucial to your success by simply using software.  For example, there’s a piece of software called Love Machine that helps employees build better social skills by incentivizing them to interact with each other. With it you can send a thank you message to a helpful colleague. The twist is that all the other employees can also see your thank you message. The goal is to encourage employees not to hide and protect their knowledge, but instead to share it and help others.  As it turns out, the thank you message creates an incentive for other people to help. It sometimes even develops into a competition about who can be the most helpful! The key message in this book: Technological progress is inevitable, but has both positive and negative consequences. If we humans want to keep our jobs, we need to build up human skills that computers can’t develop, such as empathy, and take action to manage technology’s negative effects.  Actionable advice: Use technology to enhance your skillset. Take advantage of the huge range of online learning communities and learn something for free that will boost your skillset – and your résumé. For example, you can learn leadership, decision-making or project management skills with thousands of other learners, and even get a certificate from the university when you successfully complete the course.

Hess and Katherine Ludwig","summary":"The cult classic sci-fi film Blade Runner featured flying cars, powerful artificial intelligence and a world unlike any that had ever been seen. But movies like this rarely if ever depict the nitty-gritty of the technological advancements we can expect to witness in the future. For instance, what will a factory floor, a call center or a real-estate office look like in the year 2100? Transformative technologies like flying cars may sound cool, but the changes to the working world are likely going to be more momentous. So what can we expect from the future of work? And more importantly, how can humans prepare for a world dominated by smart technology and robotic intelligence? Well, as AI takes off, humans will need to secure a professional niche for themselves or risk falling into obsolescence. The key to doing so is humility – cultivating interpersonal skills and collaboration and leveraging the creativity that sets us apart from machines. In these blinks, you’ll learn how machines are changing the world as we know it; the four skills you need to succeed in the future; and what it means to truly have humility. The second millennium may be young, but we’re quickly approaching one of its defining eras: the Smart Machine Age, or SMA. This term describes a time when machines will become increasingly capable of performing complex tasks and nonroutine work – jobs that once required human labor. As the SMA dawns, technologies like robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and genetic engineering will quickly come to dominate the professional and personal lives of humans. As they continue to become more sophisticated, machines will take on more manual and cognitive tasks, both in and outside the workplace. What does this mean for humans? Well, if you’re a lawyer, a journalist, a teacher or an accountant, you can’t be too certain that your job is secure. It could be taken over by a robot in the future. In fact, a 2013 study done by researchers at Oxford University found an extreme likelihood that as many as 47 percent of US jobs will be replaced by technology within the next two decades. So human success in the SMA depends on a whole new approach; we must be NewSmart. After all, we can’t compete with machines in terms of processing and retaining huge amounts of information. Our options are either to complement the work of machines or do the work they can’t, which includes critical thinking, emotional engagement and creative practices. However, in a society that’s hyperfocused on competition, aggression and individual success, we’re often too self-involved and fixed in our beliefs to be adept at such skills. This impedes progress. We will only excel when we learn to collaborate, an ability that enables greater critical thinking, emotional engagement and creativity. But our general unwillingness to work together doesn’t mean humanity is doomed. Indeed, there’s a way to acquire the skills that will help you transcend your current limitations. In the next blinks, you’ll learn all about it. So what skills are key to success in the Smart Machine Age? Well, the first is known as quieting ego. This refers to the ability to trim back your emotional defensiveness, directing empathy toward others by letting your guard down and becoming more objective, open-minded and open-hearted. For instance, when you get unflattering feedback from a friend or colleague, you should welcome the criticism. Avoid the very human impulse to tell yourself that he’s just wrong. In addition to quieting your ego, you should also focus on managing self. This means fostering a healthy and controlled approach to your thoughts and feelings. Without this skill, you’ll grow preoccupied with your fears and insecurities, which will prevent you from connecting with others. And this may deprive you of the power of critical and creative thinking that can be derived from human collaboration. For example, many people fear that they won’t be accepted for who they are. This anxiety can be so pronounced that it actually prevents them from interacting with others at all. The third skill you need is reflective listening, which is a way to free your thoughts and perceptions of the world, and transcend your cognitive and emotional biases. Reflective listening is about taking the time to truly understand other people and their ideas. Practicing this skill will help you open your mind and challenge your preconceived notions of the world. With a more open mind, you’ll be better at forging productive, collaborative relationships. And finally, to succeed in the SMA, you need to master otherness. This skill simply refers to the ability to establish strong connections with other people. In the SMA, a focus on creative thinking and emotional connection is of the utmost importance – so it’s clear why mastering otherness is necessary. Before you collaborate with others, you first need to connect with them. Now you know which skills will help you navigate the SMA, but before you begin developing them, you need to focus on making one important change; you need to transform your personal beliefs. For the vast majority of us, our worldview doesn’t sync well with the skills required by the SMA. To overcome this obstacle, you’ve got to change your mental model. The mental model is the sum total of your personal ideas, beliefs and perceptions of the world. In other words, it’s everything that has shaped your experience and understanding of the world, from your education to your culture, your geography to your religion. The issue is that most mental models are based on an understanding of the world that was, not of the new world that is to be. This past world was all about individualism and competition, which are anathema to the skills that will benefit you in the SMA. So success means updating your mental model, and the name of the game here is humility. Humility is the foundation for the ideal SMA mental model. But what exactly is humility? You might be thinking that it’s some religious concept, the idea of being submissive, meek or occupying a lowly position. But humility is actually just a mindset that allows you to lower your defenses and wash away your biases, which, in turn, enables you to perceive the world and meet people as they truly are. To put it differently, humility is an attitude that lets you operate in a self-accurate, open-minded way that focuses on others, rather than on yourself. The idea isn’t to act selflessly or think less of yourself; rather, humility will help you think less about yourself. If you can master humility, you’ll be on track to developing the skills necessary for the SMA. So, with that information in your back pocket, let’s move on to how you actually build those other skills. Have you ever tried to carry out a complex task while nervous or upset? Well, just as being upset or nervous can make it hard to perform at your best, so can a nervous or tangled up ego. To break down this roadblock you need to quiet the ego and the best way to do so is through mindfulness. Mindfulness is simply about paying attention; it means purposefully noticing the present moment in a nonjudgmental way. Employing this practice is simple: Get into a comfortable position, whether it’s sitting, lying down or some other arrangement. Then, focus your attention and awareness on one thing and one thing alone. This could be your entire body or a particular part of it, or an abstract concept like compassion or kindness. Regardless of what the one thing is, focusing your attention on it alone will allow you to experience all of your personal – and thus biased – thoughts in a more detached way. This space will allow you to recognize when these thoughts are interfering with the attention you’re trying to direct toward someone or something. Eventually, you’ll get better at letting go of your biased thoughts, and, soon enough, you’ll no longer have to identify with or act on them. Thus, you’ll learn to focus less on your ego. From there, it’s but a hop, skip and jump to mastering self-management. Self-management begins with slowing down and thinking deliberately. Some people protest at this point, thinking, “If I slow down, people will think I’m lazy or incompetent.” However, such thoughts are simply your fear and insecurity at play – your worries of not being accepted or respected. The reality is that slowing down is essential to your success in the SMA as it will allow you to act and think deliberately. After all, if you rush through life you’ll have a hard time doing more than going through the motions. You’ll never have the time to manage yourself and consider what you actually should be doing or thinking. How do you become a reflective listener? Getting started is as simple as focusing on the other person, keeping an open mind and asking clarifying questions. Making an effort to understand other people requires giving them your utmost attention, an act of focus that will prevent you from jumping to conclusions that could result in judgments. Let’s say a lower-level colleague of yours has an idea for how the company can increase sales. You might be her senior, but you should listen nonetheless. If the idea doesn’t make sense, ask her why it’s important. Who knows – your own preconceptions might be blocking your understanding! But you should also prepare yourself to listen reflectively using a more pragmatic approach: a checklist. Make one for yourself by writing down every aspect that you consider key to your ability to listen reflectively. You might put down things like, “don’t interrupt immediately” or “don’t allow focus to drift.” For example, after a workshop on reflective listening led by one of the authors, a participant made a checklist before calling his wife and kids. He reminded himself to ask questions and avoid interrupting his family with stories about himself. Afterward, he said that the conversation was one of the best he and his wife had shared in years. And of course, you’ve got to develop your ability to connect emotionally with others. To do so, indicate to other people that you’re present and listening, using both verbal and nonverbal cues. This second part is crucial because showing people that you’re present isn’t just about greeting them; it also means displaying welcoming attention through your actions and mannerisms. So when you meet a potential collaborator, be sure to make eye contact and welcome her with a smile; greet her with open arms and put down whatever phone or gadget you might be fiddling with. If you follow all these steps, you’ll be much more likely to welcome the other person with your full being, and to forge an emotional connection that lasts. The key message in this book: For better or for worse, a new age is dawning on humanity: an age dominated by machines. To succeed in this new time, humans need to focus on the attributes that distinguish us from machines; we’ve got to focus on emotional connection and collaboration, and on the creative thinking that these two activities give rise to. Actionable advice: Ask yourself how you think. Managing yourself can be difficult but you can get a handle on your thoughts and feelings by considering how you think. This question of course implies that there are multiple ways to think and, once you start thinking about it, you’ll start to notice your different approaches. Maybe you’re thinking fast and operating on autopilot. Or you could be giving yourself time to slow down and deliberate. By simply taking space to consider these different modes, you’ll already be one step closer to managing yourself and your mind. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It has also opened up entirely new modes of content consumption, be that content music, movies or books. We now live in the world of file-sharing, where paying for music, movies or software might seem outdated, because, usually, it’s possible to download it for free. When attacked, the proponents of file-sharing protest that information wants to be free. But does it, really? In these blinks, you’ll learn why copyright laws need to change; why locking your content up is not the way to go; and how a Pennsylvania school spied on their students. People often say that the rise of the internet precipitated the downfall of record labels and copyright law. Huge record labels no longer have much say in who emerges as the next big musical star. Stars now rise and fall online, and the internet has its own criteria. It’s in this environment that no-name indie bands like the Arctic Monkeys can achieve monumental success. But how does this work? Well, the internet has made fundamental changes to how consumers access creative content. If you want to listen to a song or look at a painting, for instance, you no longer need to pay for an album or a museum ticket; you just need to go online. As a result, people are growing accustomed to free access. We stream movies; we listen to music on YouTube; we search for images.  But, in such an environment, artists must be unable to earn money from their content, right?   Actually, not really. If given the opportunity, people still want to pay for quality content. In fact, since the advent of art, there have always been people willing to pay for it. For instance, long ago, patrons greatly influenced the creative process of artists like Michelangelo. More recently, this power was wielded by major labels like EMI, who paid bands like The Beatles for their music. And today, thanks to the internet, lovers of art can directly pay those making it. So, the internet is actually advantageous for artists.  When people are given free creative content, like music on YouTube, a lot of them will check it out, appreciate it and move on without spending a dime. But there will always be a few who want to support and appreciate the artist by paying, especially if paying the artist is easy. If all it takes is typing a song name into the iTunes Store, some consumers will always pay their fair share instead of illegally downloading a lower-quality file. So, the internet has opened up access to content. Naturally this raises copyright concerns for creators and consumers alike. But how can a content creator make a profit and prevent the pirating and free distribution of their work? Well, digital locks are one possibility.  A digital lock is basically an algorithmic way to scramble your content, protecting it until the proper key is entered, at which point the content returns to a readable form. These types of keys are used just about everywhere, from your Kindle to your DVD player.  The trouble is that digital locks don’t really work: any programmer with a few days on their hands could easily crack a key. So, while such locks are widely used by the likes of Amazon and Sony, they’re far from secure. Just take the hacker Muslix64, who cracked the key to a HD-DVD player in a snap. After that, the information on how to play such DVDs on any player spread all over the internet.  What’s worse, the middlemen who create the digital locks can hold your content captive. Once you let a middleman – a distributor, say – lock your content, they control who has access to it. For instance, Hachette, one of the world’s largest book publishers, learned about the power of the middleman the hard way. They allowed a digital lock to be put on all the books they sold on Amazon, but when they turned down an unfair contract renegotiation from Amazon, the reaction was immediate. Mere hours later, none of the publisher’s books were available on Kindle. Not even ones from famous authors like J.K. Rowling. What’s worse, Hachette basically couldn’t do anything but complain.  Clearly, digitally locking your content isn’t very helpful. Furthermore, it can actually be dangerous, too. In the previous blink, we saw just how ineffective digital locks can be. But there’s more: they can also expose you to hackers and viruses. That’s because digital locks enable companies to install hidden software on your computer.  For instance, since computers at this point are designed to run essentially any program, the producers of digital-content locks have to prevent computers from running certain programs, like those capable of copying a CD. Accomplishing this requires the secret installation of what’s called a rootkit, which is essentially a bunch of software, often malicious, that taps into otherwise inaccessible parts of your system.  Just take Sony BMG who, in 2005, sent out over six million CDs to customers. Unbeknownst to these customers, running this CD installed a program that prevented consumers from copying music off of it. This program – a rootkit – was an easy target for abuse. Essentially, Sony made their customer’s computers vulnerable to hackers and virus producers, because the rootkit provided a gateway for installing malware, which can disable a user’s system, and spyware, which surveils customers’ computers, stealing passwords and other information.  However, Sony isn’t the only one doing this. Another huge scandal broke in 2009 when a Pennsylvania school gave out 2,300 laptops to its students. Installed on the laptops was hidden software that enabled the camera to turn on and snap photos without the user’s knowledge.  Thousands of unsuspecting students had their pictures taken, but it only became clear what was happening when the school used photographic evidence taken in a student’s bedroom to bust him for drug use! So, what’s the common ground shared by resistance to copyright laws, digital locks and censorship? They all point to one simple truth: people want to be free and want the internet to be as free as they are. But naturally, that won’t happen without a fight.  In fact, over the last few years, the battle between censorship and the free internet has intensified. For instance, digital locks have been broken by internet “pirates,” censorship is being protested across the globe, hackers are waging escalating cyber wars against governments and state secrets are being exposed on pages like WikiLeaks. No matter which side you’re on, the free internet is a controversial topic.  So, while multilateral contracts like SOPA and PIPA were designed to reduce internet piracy and protect copyright laws, these contracts have only produced outrage online. Millions of angry citizens called the US senate, and the legislation was repealed.  In fact, more restrictive copyright laws will only make this “copyfight” worse. If customers feel that copyright restrictions are impinging on their freedom – if, say, videos critical of the government are banned or corporations attempt to control internet content by demanding the removal of copyrighted material – these consumers will join forces and more people will turn to the illegal corners of the internet, like the deep web.  But censorship happens in other ways, too. For instance, tech companies like Facebook, YouTube and Google are becoming more powerful by the day, increasing the risk for greater censorship in the process.  How exactly? Well, most people rely heavily on sites like Facebook, YouTube and Google, which puts tremendous power in the hands of these companies. They literally determine what content you’re most likely to see. If you doubt this, ask yourself how often you look past the first ten search results on Google? By controlling the content of the top search results, Google is essentially deciding which content makes it through to you, and, by extension, which companies go broke and which ones succeed. So, the restrictions of copyright laws are a point of contention and conflict. However, the whole idea behind copyright is to protect people against exploitation. That’s why it might be time to adapt copyright to the needs of those it seeks to regulate. It was once safe to assume that anyone who wanted to reproduce copyrighted material was seeking to make a profit. Therefore, it made perfect sense to require anyone hoping to reproduce something to first obtain the permission of the original producer.  Today, however, the issue isn’t so clear-cut, which raises the question: To whom should copyright laws apply? We’re in the twenty-first century, and everyone copies everything. It’s ridiculous to require a ten-year-old fan-fiction writer to seek Warner Bros.’s approval to use characters and storylines from the Harry Potter franchise. Such laws simply shouldn’t apply to the cultural activities of normal people. A more sensible solution would be to limit copyright to industrial regulation. Furthermore, in so far as it limits our privacy, access to information and freedom of speech, copyright is also an issue of human rights. Since we do just about everything online – our shopping, our banking, even our dating – the internet has transformed from a luxury into a necessity.  Limiting access to this necessity by copyrighting content therefore threatens our right to freedom of expression. Just imagine if stories of human rights abuses were copyrighted: we’d be unable to access them and so unable to speak out. And copyrights can also be used to infringe on our privacy. For instance, a few years back, Viacom sued Google and YouTube for letting users upload videos that had been flagged as private because this prevented Viacom from reviewing the videos for proprietary material.  Luckily, the judge ruled against Viacom; if he hadn’t, however, there would have been huge ramifications. Companies would then have been able to access a user’s personal files to check for private material. The key message in this book: As it functions today, copyright law often enables censorship and is dangerous to content creators and consumers alike. Clearly, the digital age requires a new approach to regulating creative content.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

These blinks shine a light on the breakthroughs being made by female innovators today, from their academic success to their innate knack for business, and instigation of vital social change. It also reveals the incredible challenges that women face, due to gender discrimination that is deeply – but not irredeemably – rooted in the industry. Astonishing statistics and inspiring personal tales make these blinks a fascinating read and a reality check. In the following blinks, you’ll also learn how 2001: A Space Odyssey and a brilliant female innovator brought live sports to your living room; the euphemistic technical term for only hiring white male nerds; and how sexual harassment killed a multi-million-dollar deal. Think about some of the great innovators in the technology industry. Who comes to mind first? Founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, or Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame? Or perhaps, Kay Koplovitz? If you haven’t heard of Koplovitz’s groundbreaking work, here’s the reason why: She’s a woman. Why is it that we usually associate the technological advances of recent decades with only the men behind them? It’s not the case that women don’t have what it takes to innovate, in fact, quite the opposite. A study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that females matched males in mathematical achievement. Moreover, for every 100 men that enrol in higher education, there are 140 women. Not only do women excel academically, they are also no less business-savvy than men, if not more so. Another study completed by Babson’s Global Entrepreneurship revealed that female-led high-tech start-ups have noticeably lower failure rates than those that are male leaders. Despite this, the technology industry itself often praises the achievements of men only. In fact, even over the past few years, the TechCrunch Crunchies Awards (the Oscars of the tech industry), have often been exclusively awarded to men. As a result, we’re often left unaware of the achievements of female innovators like Kay Klopovitz, who you should thank if you’ve ever watched a live sports game on TV. In 1977, Klopovitz singlehandedly brought professional sport to cable television in the United States. Inspired by a talk given by the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke, she brought the future to life by developing the novel idea of using satellites for commercial rather than military purposes. If only we heard more about success stories like Klopovitz, we’d see that women might even have an edge over men in their abilities to innovate. This is exactly what we’ll be exploring in the next blink, as we take a closer look at the tech businesswomen we rarely hear about. Did you know that women actually have a knack for success in entrepreneurial ventures?  In 2009, a Kauffman Foundation study showed that women were more capital-efficient than men. Or, in plain English, women in business spend the money they start off with more wisely. They also see more stable or greater returns on this money. Not only do women in business have a knack for managing money, they also demonstrate sophisticated people skills. Women generally place a higher value on personal and professional networks than men, and spend more time cultivating good business partnerships. Another distinctive way in which women make great business leaders is what Whitney Johnson, cofounder of Rose Park Advisors, calls disruptive innovation. How exactly can something be disruptive and innovative at the same time? Disruptive innovations outperform existing and outdated ideas or businesses. For example, email is a disruptive innovation, when we consider how it blew the almost-obsolete snail mail out of the water. Women are disruptive innovators in the way that they build and maintain networks outside of their organizations. A professor of the Harvard Business School has demonstrated this in his research, showing the way women work “outside the box” to bring new ideas and people together in a novel way. Of course, anyone can dream up novel ideas, but it seems women in particular are also highly successful at turning these ideas into profitable companies. This can be seen when we look at companies backed by venture capitalists: highly selective and demanding investors who invest in small businesses so they can grow. One study showed that on average, the successful venture capital-backed companies have double the amount of women in their highest ranks, indicating the value of their contribution. The CEO characters that you see in TV shows and movies all tend to look the same – middle-aged, suited-up and male. But this pop culture stereotype is far from reality – while we don’t often see powerful female CEOs depicted in the media, female-led and -owned businesses shouldn’t be overlooked. Not only are women beginning to lead their own companies, they’re also enjoying large amounts of success. And they’re no minority either – the Center for Women’s Business Research says that as many as 41 percent of private businesses in the United States are owned by women. These businesses also tend to be highly successful and consistently outperform their male-owned counterparts. After surveying highly profitable firms in 2013, American Express found that among businesses with revenue greater than $10 million, those owned by women enjoyed a 47 percent higher rate of growth. Moreover, from 2002 to 2012, female-owned businesses grew 28.6 percent, while other businesses only grew 24.4 percent. Once again, women-owned companies came out on top! Despite their success, businesses led by women often struggle to acquire funding. Another study, also by the Center for Women’s Business Research, discovered that in spite of the large portion of private businesses owned by women, as little as three to five percent of these actually receive venture capital-based funding and support. A significant reason for this can be directly tied to gender bias. Venture capitalists often talk about their skill in pattern recognition, or their aptitude for spotting bright entrepreneurs with profitable ideas. What this often means, however, is that these venture capitalists look for people that remind them of themselves. Of 89 venture capitalists on TheFunded.com’s top 100 list, only one is a woman. So “pattern recognition” is really just a euphemism for investing in white, male nerds. Not only are women making waves in technology, they’re also making a difference in the world. Many female innovators have utilized technology to address worldwide poverty and inequality. As entrepreneurs, women have a vested interest in overcoming an oppressive status quo. Women all over the world are socially and economically marginalized, and this is particularly clear in developing countries. For example, in Mexico, the prevailing macho culture forces women into traditional gender roles and often prevents girls, particularly in rural towns, from completing their education. However, there is now a growing current of social change in Mexico, as women begin to set up microenterprises – very small businesses, usually started from a low- or no-interest loan. 36 percent of microenterprises are run by women, which amounts to around two million small companies. These new developments are highly promising, but unfortunately up to 90 percent of microenterprises fail in their first year. This is something that female entrepreneurs like Leticia Casanueva are working to change. Her company provides training and tools like simple inventory tracking software to help rural women start and run financially stable businesses. Not only do entrepreneurial women help to boost the rural economy, they also work hard to provide a much-needed source of female employment in these areas. A leading example is the work of Resha Jazrawi as the co-founder of Acumen – a firm that makes investments specifically aimed at creating jobs for those who need them most, i.e., women. Acumen’s investments are called patient investments, as they allow a business to develop slowly without the expectation of fast returns. One example of Acumen’s impact can be seen in the A to Z textile mills in Tanzania, which manufacture anti-malaria mosquito nets. Aside from providing a helpful product, this investment has created as many as 80,000 jobs, 90 percent of which are designed for women. Right from the outset, women in technology struggle against the industry’s gender bias. In fact, this sort of discrimination begins before they can even launch their careers. Many women and minorities are actively discouraged from pursuing a career in science, technology, engineering or mathematics. These disciplines, known as the STEM fields, are rife with gender stereotypes – countless women talk even of high school teachers who deemed them not good enough to make a career in STEM, despite their exceptional grades. Female students are often judged using unfounded assumptions, such as that women are “too sociable” to work in science. A 2010 Beyer Corporation survey found that as many as 40 percent of female and/or minority chemists and chemical engineers had been discouraged from pursuing their careers. If, despite this discouragement, a young female student makes her way through her studies with excellent marks and begins to search for a job, she will yet again be met with discrimination. In tech, hiring policies are so skewed that certain jobs are effectively “men only.” Bright Labs found these gender discrepancies were overwhelming in the United States: 92.7 percent of network engineers, 91.5 percent of PC technicians, 90.4 percent of IT support workers and 90 percent of software engineers were men. Despite this obvious imbalance, high-earning companies have yet to show any initiative to rectify things. A 2012 survey by McKinsey & Company found that only eight percent of larger companies had women in more than 25 percent of the top jobs. This is a reality we can see statistically and socially. For example, when attending a tech conference in Uruguay, female telematics engineer Agustina was briskly told by a key investor: “I don’t have much to say to you because I’m a techie nerd.” The investor assumed that women weren’t interested or knowledgeable, nor had anything to say about technology. It’s easy to admire the success of a high-powered male professional. But you should remember that these men enjoy an advantage: they have been free to pursue their career, unlike women, who are forced to decide between career and family in order to achieve their goals. This is a great challenge for female professionals, especially as workplace culture makes technology industries notoriously unfriendly places for single mothers. The collective mind-sets of many start-ups are geared toward the single male rather than a woman with family responsibilities. For example, the simple act of leaving work at 5 p.m. is considered a faux pas in the industry. Female employees frequently report being stigmatized by their male colleagues for working “mommy hours” to accommodate school and child care, even if these women come to work as early as 5 a.m. and work just as many hours! The entrepreneurial environment also involves networking during “happy hours” – late nights and weekends. As a result, many women are forced to pay a “female tax” by not participating in these extracurricular activities, because they look after their children instead. Thankfully, formal support systems are starting to assist career-oriented women with families. Some progressive countries have legislation to support women during maternity leave and ensure companies don’t discriminate against them when hiring. Germany, for example, has developed the Elterngeld system, which pays either parent 67 percent of their earnings during leave. In many cases, however, men do not take up their parental leave. So mothers are frequently called upon to be the primary caregiver. This was highlighted by a study conducted by Stanford University, which found that mid-career men were four times as likely as their female counterparts to have a partner who took responsibility for household and children. And yet our cultural norms still dictate that only “bad mothers” would place the same importance on their career as their family. Although we wish it were a thing of the past, sexual discrimination is still alive and well. In fact, it’s something women have to deal with on a daily basis to varying degrees. Remember the “female tax” we learned about earlier? Well, it also extends to what female professionals wear – make-up, style and sex appeal are all things women have to worry about before they even start the day. Some businesswomen have even internalized this, instructing younger employees to pay attention to how they dress as a critical factor in their career success. Unsurprisingly, many women, such as Catherine Rose, project manager for interactive teaching tool LightAide, are dismayed that they are not valued by their PhD or MBA, but for their outward appearance. This trend is also seen in the mainstream press. For example, when interviewing entrepreneur and technology executive Kim Polese, Fortune magazine chose to run the story with a close-up of her face, and used the angle that Polese was a tech industry “femme fatale.” Polese had explicitly asked beforehand that the story focus on her software management company Marimba. Worse still, women in technology also unfortunately suffer outright sexual harassment. Heidi Roizen, the former worldwide developer for Apple relations, experienced this first hand. While working for a multi-million-dollar software company, Roizen was on the verge of signing a company-defining deal with large computer manufacturer. She was invited to sign the deal over supper in a luxurious restaurant and during the meal, the vice president of the manufacturer lewdly tried to coax her hand onto his crotch. Naturally, she stormed out of the building, and the deal fell through. Millions in revenue were lost. These are just some of the manifestations of the sexism still sadly prevalent in the high tech industry. From what we’ve seen of the workplace culture in the technology industry, the challenges for women are deeply entrenched. Which makes one wonder – is change even possible?  Not if we deny the problem, which only reduces accountability and maintains the harmful status quo. Instead, gender imbalances need to be discussed in a public forum, though such dialogue may not be received warmly. For instance, in 2010, co-author Vivek Wadwha published a widely read piece called Silicon Valley: You and Some of Your VCs have a Gender Problem that exposed the shocking gender imbalances in high tech companies. It was met with a huge uproar, and many senior figures publicly attacked the author on social media. Some colleagues even emailed him, saying “there are easier ways to get laid.”The article also brought Twitter under fire, by exposing the imbalanced demographics in the company: all of Twitter’s board members and executives were male. Its leaders vociferously attacked those that attempted to bring the gender issue to light. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo actively denied the existence of the issue. However, in 2014, Twitter added an additional female board member, and a flurry of other tech companies followed suit. Clearly, it took a large-scale public relations embarrassment for Twitter to bring positive change to their company and others. Positive change in the technology industry should begin with reform in a crucial area: hiring policies. If recruitment pools are broadened, there is a chance to bring about gender equality. Universities have equal numbers, if not greater numbers, of female STEM graduates than male. If firms recruit directly from graduate programs, a higher percentage of female applicants are instantly available. Another way to increase diversity is through a quota system. This has been successful in other fields such as sports management. For example, the “Rooney rule” employed in National Football League ensures that minorities are interviewed for management positions. This could be an effective approach in the technology industry, ensuring that a certain percentage of positions are filled by women.  The key message in this book: The technology industry is a boys club that needs to be exposed. Firstly, for the sake of the talented women, who are challenged daily despite being instinctively business-savvy high academic performers, and arbiters of social change, not to mention mothers. And secondly, for the progression of the technology industry today and in the future.  Actionable advice: Girls make great geeks!  If you are turning away from a career in technology, perhaps because you feel it’s only for geeky guys, then you’d better think again! There are many innovative, powerful and inspirational women in the technology industry today, all proving that it’s not only possible for women to be tech leaders, but vital.

Or maybe you’ve bought ethically produced clothes? You may have felt good afterward – but how much lasting change did your actions bring about? Probably very little. This is the underlying problem with modern-day participatory left-wing politics. While such actions may offer the feeling that you are doing something at the moment, the long-term effects are harder to judge. In a world where capitalism and neoliberalism are the ruling ideologies of the day, any will to change must imply something more than buying the “right” banana or coffee. So let’s look at how we got to where we are and how to move forward. In these blinks, you’ll find out why complex systems like the economy show the limits of folk politics; how a fringe group of academics and intellectuals would come to dominate mainstream politics; and why the automating work will be a blessing for workers around the world. What do street protests, shopping at local stores and teach-ins all have in common? Well, every one of these standard leftist political actions is an example of folk politics, a term that refers to ideas and attitudes that emphasize local, direct-action and small-scale approaches to politics. Good examples of folk politics are movements like Occupy Wall Street, ethical consumption or any of the many student occupations throughout history. While each of these examples might have received its moment in the media spotlight and a burst of temporary momentum, they often fail to make structural change in the long run. These tactics are no longer sufficient in the contemporary political climate and, if applied now, would fail to produce structural change. How come? Because at its core, folk-politics is about everyday manifestations and not structural problems. For instance, it promotes personal action like sign-making and the occasional protest over systematic thinking like making changes to legal structures or running candidates for office. In other words, it puts feelings – like anger, frustration and outrage – above critical thinking and strategy. But the issue here isn’t that folk politics is morally bad or incorrect. Rather, the problem is that it has no sustainable long-term strategy or vision. Instead of guiding the course of history, folk politics simply reacts to the actions initiated by corporations and governments. Not only that, but by bringing people together around single issues, it loses sight of the bigger picture. A classic example is the organization Live Aid. In 1985, this group raised loads of money to provide famine relief in Ethiopia. To do so, they hosted tear-jerking, celebrity-led events. The problem was that their approach solely appealed to people’s emotions, rather than their rational minds. Beyond that, a lot of the money raised ended up in the hands of rebel militias, thereby extending the civil war and worsening the famine. So, folk politics’ reliance on local, individual actions and personal emotions severely limit its efficacy, but another problem is its focus on immediate, self-gratifying goals at the expense of lasting, long-term change. For instance, folk politics might celebrate a corporation delaying the construction of an oil pipeline, failing to recognize that the company is just waiting until people look away so that it can move forward with the project. In this case, the issue isn’t that folk politics is local, but that it sees local actions as sufficient in and of themselves, rather than as necessary elements within a longer-term vision. But if it’s so ineffective, why are people so enamored with folk politics? A major reason is that it simplifies complex global issues. After all, global society is a complex system, loaded with interlocking arenas like world politics, economics, climate change and globalization. For most people, such ideas are difficult to grasp. For instance, the global economy isn’t something that can be directly perceived. Instead, it’s a collection of different actions, players and outcomes, distributed across various systems. In other words, you’ll never meet “the economy” in person. It’s a convoluted web of elements from property laws to natural resource distribution, technological infrastructure and much more. Such a separation between everyday experiences and the systems within which we live alienates people, as the extensive and complicated effects of these systems make it difficult for us to find our own experience within them. Just take the cultural theorist Fredric Jameson. He says conspiracy theories are popular because people feel so alienated from the systems in which they live. Conspiracy theories narrow perspective into a single, culpable party, whether it be the Freemasons, the Bilderberg Group or any other convenient scapegoat. Conspiracy theories are popular because they provide a simple answer to the question, “Who’s responsible?” The problem is that these theories obscure our own role in the situation at hand and simplify cause-and-effect relationships. Similarly, folk politics is appealing because it simplifies the complex world by directing energy at concrete, immediate actions. In so doing, it bypasses the complex, elusive reality of global relations. To better understand the limits of folk politics – and the contemporary left in general – just think about what the other side has been able to accomplish. While folk politics is failing to make lasting change, the political opposition has been able to transform society through neoliberalism. This political ideology can be summed up by a steadfast belief in unimposed, free-market capitalism. However, since classic liberalism is about free markets and opposing government regulation, neoliberalism ironically relies heavily on state influence to defend property rights, impose antitrust laws and generally sustain the neoliberal world order. Since its inception, neoliberalism has covered the globe, infiltrating media outlets, public policy circles, education, labor and even the self-perception and identities of ordinary people. Neoliberal hegemony peaked in the mid-1990s with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise of the Clinton administration in the United States and the ubiquitous penetration of this ideology in academic economics circles. Nowadays, it can be seen in the social expectation that people will constantly update their skill sets to remain employable, a reflection of a continual push toward self-branding and the incessant drive to network, with all the stress, anxiety and depression this produces. In fact, neoliberalism has become so entrenched in our worldview that it’s practically impossible to see any alternative. However, before it became the behemoth it is today, neoliberalism was a fringe theory. It emerged in Vienna in the 1920s and in Chicago, London and Germany in the 1930s. Then, in 1938, all of these previously independent movements formed a transnational organization at the Walter Lippmann Colloquium in Paris. This gathering brought together classical liberal theorists and economists like Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises to form the Mont Pelerin Society or MPS. The explicit aim of this group was to develop and spread a new type of liberalism. The MPS was a closed intellectual circle that included most of the central figures in the postwar creation of neoliberalism. Hayek and von Mises played key roles, as did the American economist Milton Friedman and many others. But how did such a small group of thinkers bring their neoliberal project to dominate the global stage? We’ll learn all about it in the next blink. While we can complain about neoliberalism being the dominant political and cultural idea of our time, it’s impossible to dispute how effectively it carried out its aims. In fact, the hegemonic position neoliberalism achieved is the result of a carefully considered, long-term, top-down strategy. This strategy had neoliberals put together policy arguments that were then systematically pushed through think tanks, like the Heritage Foundation and the Hoover Institute, as well as universities. These institutions then trained the global elite, further spreading neoliberalism and cementing its ideological influence across the globe. For instance, in Chicago, Milton Friedman wrote detailed op-eds and news columns, and regularly appeared on TV, an unprecedented move for an academic at the time. Newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, the Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times worked in sync to promote his ideas, while businesses funded a popular TV show in the 1980s based on his work called Free to Choose. Not only that, but Friedman’s 1980 book, also entitled Free to Choose, sold better than any other nonfiction title that year. The combined effect of all these efforts assembled a massive audience for Friedman’s economic and social ideas. As you already know, this strategy worked. By the 1980s, neoliberalism was the commonly accepted political ideology across the board. Politicians rose to prominence under its free-market flag, including Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom. So, what can be learned from this absolute neoliberal onslaught? The most important takeaway is that the left needs to build a similarly long-term, strategic vision. To do so, the left will need to abandon its fear of organizational secrecy, hierarchy and rationality. Such changes are essential if we are to build and sustain a comparably hegemonic position. This means that, instead of just reacting to the political moves of the right and the now-accepted neoliberal policies of our world, the left must actively build an alternative. We must construct a positive vision for society by increasing the sophistication of our organization. Next up, we’ll take a closer look at what that vision entails. Now that we know what type of approach is called for on the left, what should we be fighting for? Well, to answer that question, we first need to begin with an examination of the current state of labor. This is a key factor, since full automation and unemployment grow more likely by the day, even as people work more than ever. Take industry as an example: while the industrial sector employed just 1,000 robots in 1970, today it relies on over 1.6 million. Meanwhile, unemployment is on the rise, with job growth predominantly confined to the service sector. But even in service jobs, robotization is creeping in. Pretty soon, every person, whether they’re a chef, a construction worker or even a stock analyst, will be vulnerable to replacement by machines. In fact, the most detailed estimates of the labor market’s trajectory suggest that between 47 percent and 80 percent of today’s jobs could be automated. As a result, people who do have jobs are desperate to keep them and are therefore working longer hours than ever before. It’s interesting to note that economists and thinkers in the past didn’t believe this would happen. The economist John Maynard Keynes famously argued that nobody would work longer than a 15-hour week by 2030. Karl Marx also assumed that people would be living very differently by now, with far greater personal freedom from monotonous jobs. But none of these predictions have come true. Shortly after World War II, the workweek stabilized at 40 hours, and since then there have been few attempts to change that. Moreover, technology has eroded the separation between work and life. As a result, the average full-time worker in the United States works closer to 47 hours per week. That all being said, full automation should be our goal – and we’ll learn why in the final blink. How can we deal with the impending reality of full automation? By embracing it! After all, the loss of jobs prompted by automation will lead to the need for universal basic income or UBI, the idea of giving every citizen enough money to live on. It might sound like a utopian impossibility, but UBI isn’t as radical or new an idea as you might think. For instance, in the 1960s and 70s, basic income was a core proposal of the US welfare system. Economists, NGOs and policymakers were all exploring the idea in great detail. In fact, 1,300 economists signed a petition urging the US Congress to pass UBI, and two presidents, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, attempted to pass it as legislation. UBI is an idea that has been gaining momentum in the modern era as well. Support has come from writers like Paul Krugman and Martin Wolf, and news outlets like the New York Times and the Economist. So, UBI might not be as far-fetched as it sounds and it has a great deal to offer. For instance, an automated workforce paired with UBI would liberate humanity from work itself, allowing each of us to do whatever we wanted with our limited time on earth. In this way, it would free workers from the shackles of capitalism. For most people, working isn’t a fulfilling part of life – it’s simply a means of survival. As a result, just 13 percent of workers worldwide say their jobs are engaging. For most of them, work is a degrading, draining, downright stressful necessity. This problem would be solved by a leftist UBI that is sufficient to live off of and provided to all citizens, universally and unconditionally. But UBI wouldn’t just free us from work, it would also challenge the very notion of work itself. This is actually one of the major barriers to UBI, since most of us identify ourselves solely in terms of our work. As such, to successfully enact UBI, we must first consider how our thinking will change when we no longer need to work. The key message in this book: The current political tactics of the left are failing for working people. To succeed in transforming society, the left must take a page out of the right-wing playbook and build a long-term, strategic vision that offers an alternative to the current neoliberal, capitalist world order.

Standard office temperatures are set to the male metabolic resting rate. Regulation car safety tests are performed on male crash test dummies.  We live in a world designed for and around men. How did this bias come about?  It’s partly down to the gender data gap. When we assume that males and male needs are standard, we neglect to consider women and women’s needs. This tendency to overlook women leads to a gender data gap, in which women aren’t adequately represented in the data that underpins decision-making. The gender data gap is the source of many inconveniences that women experience on a daily basis, like longer lines for public bathrooms that aren’t built to accommodate their needs. At its most extreme, the gender data gap can have lethal consequences – for instance, worse outcomes for women in a car crash can be traced to this gap.  It’s not just women who suffer, either. From politics to the global economy, the gender data gap negatively affects all of us. To address it, we first need to face up to how it shapes our world. In these blinks, you’ll learn why snowplowing might just be a feminist issue; who reference man is; and how the gender data gap is costing us trillions in global GDP. When archaeologists uncovered an armored Viking skeleton in Sweden in 1889, they assumed the bones belonged to a male warrior – despite the skeleton’s female pelvic bone. Worse, no one noticed the error for over 100 years! And the archaeologists’ assumption here wasn’t a one-off. Women are overlooked all the time because we’re conditioned to view male as the default gender. Our tendency to center maleness goes back at least as far as the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. In On the Generation of Animals (340 BC), he describes men as normal and women as aberrations. In anatomy, too, the male body was historically the default. The female body, when it was considered at all, was the exception. Some female organs, like the ovaries, weren’t even named until the seventeenth century. But gender bias isn’t just a thing of the past. Even something as contemporary as emojis, the world’s newest language, still privileges masculinity. All emojis are assigned by a single company, called Unicode. But it’s up to each emoji-supporting platform to determine how they depict Unicode’s emojis. Before 2016, Unicode didn’t assign genders to emoji symbols; they simply stipulated that emoji symbols should include, for example, a runner or a police officer. The platforms chose to depict male runners and male police officers. It was only when Unicode began to assign gendered emoji symbols that women and men achieved “emoji parity.” In many other aspects of contemporary life, though, representational parity is a long way off. From statues to banknotes to textbooks, representation skews male. In the UK, there are more statues of men named John than there are statues of all non-royal women put together! And when it comes to UK banknotes, there’s currently only one woman depicted – Jane Austen. This skewed representation is reinforced in education. In 2014, a study found that in grammar and language textbooks, references to men outnumber references to women 3:1. In fact, as we’ll see in the next blink, this bias affects every aspect of our lives, from the design of our cars and smartphones to local neighborhood authorities’ procedures for snow shoveling! On snowy mornings in Karlskoga, Sweden, snow is cleared from sidewalks, pedestrian areas, and roads. In that order. But it used to be the other way ‘round. Why? Because first thing in the morning, full-time commuters tend to drive, while part-time workers or carers tend to travel on foot. The Karlskoga council saw the full-time commuters as the priority. But what they didn’t know is that this also meant they were favoring men over women. Full-time workers are mostly men, whereas carers and part-time workers are overwhelmingly women. The council realized they hadn’t thought to look at women in their data set. When they did, they saw the flaws in the snow-clearing schedule, and the new procedure resulted in far fewer snow-related pedestrian injuries.  Why are women's needs frequently overlooked at a policy level? Perhaps it’s because many policies, whether governmental or corporate, are set by men. Look at Facebook: COO Sheryl Sandberg wasn’t the first Facebook employee to get pregnant, but she was the first pregnant executive. She soon realized the company needed priority parking for pregnant women. Until Sandberg’s pregnancy, however, the executive suite simply hadn’t considered the needs of pregnant employees. Leaving women out of the data set creates a gender data gap that privileges men. Take European public transport, for example. Men are more likely to hold full-time jobs than women, and transport data thus focuses on mobility related to full-time employment, as a 2012 EU-wide study demonstrates. The result is a transport system that directs resources to peak travel times and doesn’t prioritize non-commuter travel.  The gender data gap leaves female transport users underserved, and even penalizes them for the way they travel. Women use public transport differently from men, but transport data fails to take this into account. Ticket prices are often set by journey, not distance. Men are likely to make a two-trip standard commute. Part-time workers and carers – again, mostly women – “trip-chain,” making a number of short trips throughout the day. The result? Women often pay more to travel shorter distances. The gender data gap doesn’t simply inconvenience women. When it isn’t addressed, the consequences can be serious, as the next blink will show. If you’ve ever attended a concert and compared the line for the ladies’ bathrooms with that for the gents, you’ll probably have noticed a disparity between the two. How does that long line happen? It’s a direct result of the gender data gap. Public planning regulations frequently stipulate that venues allocate equal bathroom space for men and women. This looks good on paper – but dig a little deeper and you’ll see this planning decision is based on data that ignores women’s needs. Women and men use bathrooms differently, but bathroom design fails to account for this. With a mix of urinals and cubicles, male bathrooms can offer more facilities than female bathrooms in the same allocated space, even though women do more in the bathroom. Women are more likely to accompany children to the bathroom. A menstruating woman might need to change her tampon or sanitary pad. Pregnant women urinate more frequently. That long line isn’t a coincidence; it’s a design flaw resulting from incomplete data. What’s inconvenient in the developed world can have far more serious consequences in the developing world. In homes without a private bathroom, access to facilities is an issue for both sexes, but a lack of public bathrooms poses more problems for women. Where a bathroom is unavailable, men relieve themselves in public, but it’s physically difficult and often socially taboo for women to do the same. Some women hold in their urine, which can lead to health issues, such as urinary tract infections and dehydration. Without access to a private toilet, women in the developing world rely on public bathrooms, which are rarely female-friendly. They’re often in unsafe locations and not segregated by gender. This means that when women leave their houses to use public bathrooms, they run the risk of sexual assault and violence. In India, women without access to a private toilet are twice as likely to experience non-partner sexual violence compared to women with bathrooms in their homes. These women are disadvantaged by bathroom designs that neglect their physical needs and safety. Now that we’ve established what the gender data gap is and how it can affect women, let’s break it down further. The next four blinks will look at how the gap affects everything from the global economy to piano design. On average, men have bigger hands than women. Tools and devices are often designed to male hand measurements. As a result, the design of many everyday objects is, quite literally, hard for women to grasp. Objects designed to male measurements prevent women from reaching their potential. Take the piano. A 2015 study rated pianists by level of acclaim. Internationally renowned pianists were ranked at the highest level. Of the 12 internationally renowned pianists, only two were women. Are men naturally better pianists?  Maybe not. This same study also measured handspan. The average female handspan is between seven and eight inches. The top-level female pianists had larger-than-average handspans: nine and 9.5 inches respectively. The standard keyboard octave is 7.4 inches. This is easily spanned by the average male hand, but not so easily spanned by the average female hand. Men aren’t innately better pianists than women. However, according to the study, the design of the standard keyboard prevents female pianists with average female handspans from reaching their full potential. In fact, the study concluded that 87 percent of female adult pianists were disadvantaged by a keyboard design that is far better suited to the male handspan.  This one-size-doesn’t-fit-all approach isn’t just affecting female concert pianists. There’s one object most women use all the time that has exactly the same design failure – the smartphone. Smartphones are ostensibly designed to be used with just one hand. But whose hand? In 2018, the average size of a smartphone was 5.5 inches. That’s pretty unwieldy if you have an average female handspan. It seems the smartphone’s hypothetical one-handed user has the hand proportions of an average male. What’s more, the width of the standard smartphone could be leading to musculoskeletal disorders among female smartphone users. Most studies on the musculoskeletal impacts of smartphone use aren’t segregated by gender – another example of the gender data gap. However, studies that are gender-segregated, like a 2016 study from the University of Seoul, report significantly higher instances of musculoskeletal problems among female smartphone users than male smartphone users. The objects and devices we use day-to-day are made to measure – but only if your measurements are that of a standard male. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how this approach is compromising women’s health and safety. When it comes to health and safety, the word “standard” more often means “standard male”; as a result, many health and safety guidelines leave women out in the cold. This is certainly the case when it comes to the recommended office temperature, which was set in the 1960s, based on the metabolic resting rate of a 40-year-old, 70 kg male – leaving women working in offices up to five degrees too cold for the average female metabolic rate. But chilly offices could be the least of women’s worries. Cars undergo stringent safety testing before they’re put on the market. But the crash test dummies required for those tests are all male. Dummies have been used since the 1950s, and, even today, the typical dummy’s dimensions remain in the 50th percentile for males. It’s 1.77m tall and weighs 76 kg, has a male spine and male muscle proportions.  Due to their anatomy and size, women tend to sit differently and wear seatbelts differently from men. In crash tests carried out with male dummies, it’s therefore impossible to gather accurate data on women’s specific safety outcomes. Some car companies do use anatomically correct female dummies – but they’re not legally required to do so. In the EU, none of the five safety tests a car must pass before being allowed on the market stipulates that a female crash test dummy should be used – even though, according to a 2011 study, women are 47 percent more likely than men to be seriously injured when they’re involved in car crashes. The auto industry assumes that the male body is standard. So does science. Just as the auto industry carries out tests on male dummies, many scientific studies test their findings on reference man. Who is reference man? He’s a Caucasian male, aged 25 to 30, who weighs 70 kg. Historically, scientific studies have used reference man to represent everyone.  This is especially problematic when it comes to health and safety in the workplace. Not only are women’s bodies proportionally and anatomically different from male bodies, they have different immune systems and hormones. These differences affect how women’s bodies tolerate exposure to radiation and industrial chemicals. And yet many health and safety recommendations are based on reference man.  As a result, female workers are being exposed to chemicals at levels that may not be harmful to men but are certainly harmful to women. A 2014 study shows that women are more affected by radiation exposure than men. And women exposed to EDCs (endocrine-disrupting chemicals) in the workplace have a 42 percent increased risk of breast cancer.  Even in medicine, a field specifically focused on the study of the body, the female body is overlooked and ignored. From infrastructure to design, men and male bodies are deemed “standard.” This is the case even in the medical field. A 2008 study of medical textbooks used across prestigious European universities found that, of 16,329 images illustrating neutral body parts, male bodies were depicted three times more often than female bodies. How does this bias affect women seeking medical care? Gender bias and the gender data gap are particularly insidious problems in the medical field – because, when it comes to medicine, data is key. It determines how doctors recognize and treat diseases and how drugs and devices are developed and administered. Numerous studies have shown that male and female bodies differ at the anatomical, organ, tissue, and cellular levels. Gathering data on female bodies is therefore critical in providing women with effective medical care.  Yet women are routinely left out of medical trials. Why? According to a 2017 EU study, women’s bodies were seen as too “complex” and “costly”; their changeable hormones make them “inconvenient” subjects.  Among other things, this means that medical devices are being brought to the market without being adequately tested on women. In the US, the FDA found that in trials for coronary stents, only 32 percent of participants were female. In trials of endovascular occlusion devices, women made up a miniscule 18 percent of participants. The gender data gap in medical trials is quantifiably detrimental to women’s health, as a 2014 FDA review of the CRT-D proves.  The CRT-D is essentially a pacemaker that is implanted in patients with heart failure. It detects irregular electrical heart waves and corrects them with a shock, a bit like a built-in defibrillator. The review found that in trials of the device, only about 20 percent of participants were female. The initial trial concluded that cardiac patients whose hearts took 150 milliseconds or longer to complete an electrical wave would benefit from a CRT-D implant. But without adequate gender representation, these findings were harmfully skewed.  As it happens, this figure was right for men, but inaccurate for women. In fact, the review found that women whose electrical waves took 130 milliseconds or longer would benefit from a CRT-D implant. Women with electrical waves between 130-149 milliseconds were later found to have their chance of heart failure reduced by 76 percent with a CRT-D implant.  Now let’s take a broader look at how the gender gap affects us at a global level, from economics to politics. From school textbooks to clinical studies, there is an endemic gender data gap. But the biggest gender gap of all occurs on a global scale – in the way we measure GDP. The GDP measures national output in terms of goods and services. Domestic work, childcare, and eldercare are services typically performed by women. When this domestic and care work is unpaid, it isn’t factored into GDP. Yet it has economic value. Indeed, when a woman performs this unpaid work, she’s frequently supporting a partner whose income is counted toward GDP.  So, what would GDP look like if it were factored in?  According to the World Bank, in 2016, Great Britain had a GDP of ￡2.7 trillion. When unpaid work is included, says the UK’s Office for National Statistics, that number is more like ￡3.9 trillion. And the UK is not alone. The UN estimates that in the US in 2012, $3.2 trillion worth of unpaid childcare was performed. The value of that unpaid care work was equal to 20 percent of the country’s $16.2 trillion GDP for that year. Similarly, an Australian study from 2017 found that if unpaid childcare were counted toward GDP, it would actually constitute Australia’s largest industry. When this work isn’t factored into the GDP, it isn’t properly quantified. And without properly quantifying women’s unpaid work, it’s difficult to support women in performing paid work.  At the moment, unpaid work is creating a gender employment gap that slows the economy. When women participate in the labor force, economies grow. Between 1970 and 2009, the female labor force increased by roughly 38 million. This increase, says the McKinsey Global Institute, generated approximately 25 percent more GDP. McKinsey also suggests that, were women to participate in the labor force at a rate equal to men, global GDP would swell to $12 trillion. That’s not exactly small change.  So what’s stopping us from closing the current 27 percent gender gap in employment? Unpaid domestic and care work is a significant factor. In Europe, where there’s currently a 12 percent gender employment gap, 25 percent of surveyed women stated that care work prevents them from joining the labor force. Only three percent of men said the same. Gathering data on women’s unpaid work would allow governments to make policy decisions that support women entering the labor force, benefiting both women and the economy. This could take the form of increased spending on social infrastructure like affordable childcare and eldercare – spending that would actually generate jobs and increase GDP. In the US, a two percent GDP investment in social infrastructure would create 13 million more jobs, compared to 7.5 million jobs if the same amount were invested in construction. If policies that enable improved social infrastructure would invite more women to join the labor force and create jobs and drive economic growth, why aren’t politicians pushing for them? The next blink tackles this tricky question. The gender data gap comes about when we assume that one gender, in this case the male gender, is the default, and that these needs are standard needs. Why has it proven so persistent? For one thing, many people making high-level data-based decisions are male. In politics, men far outnumber women. That’s a serious problem: statistics show that female politicians are far more likely to address the gender gap in their policies than their male counterparts Women are significantly underrepresented in politics. In December 2017, only 23.5 percent of the world’s politicians were women. Why aren’t more women entering politics? Perhaps because the current underrepresentation leads to the perception of politics as a “male” space – and this is bad news for women. In 2008, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley concluded that when a woman speaks in a stereotypically male context – like Wall Street, for example – she is judged more negatively than a man who says exactly the same thing. Women in the political sphere are deemed aggressive where men are assertive. This influences their likeability, which in turn affects their electability. Given their negative public perception, it’s unsurprising that female politicians are more frequently the targets of gendered abuse than male politicians. A global IPU report found that, in 2016, 66 percent of female politicians reported misogynistic abuse from male peers. Female politicians are also subjected to online abuse. In Australia, an astounding 80 percent of women over 30 reported they wouldn’t run for office due to online harassment of female politicians.  This hostility can make entering politics, not to mention staying there, a difficult proposition for women. No wonder they’re outnumbered. Unfortunately, we can’t rely on male politicians to legislate for gender equality. Female politicians are far more likely than their male peers to address the gender gap. A 2016 study of British female politicians showed that they brought women’s issues to the table more consistently than their male counterparts. Female MPs talked more about family policy, education, and social infrastructure.  What’s more, women politicians translate their talk into action. An analysis of female politicians in OECD countries between 1960 and 2005 found that they were more likely to create and support policies focused on women. A 2004 study in India backs this up: When a third of local council seats were reserved for female candidates, investment in infrastructure connected to women’s needs increased. So when women do come to political power, they’re active in enacting policies that recognize and accommodate women’s needs. Ironically, politics itself has a gender data gap; until we reach gender parity among our political representatives, it’s statistically unlikely that women’s issues will be given the weight they deserve. The key message in these blinks: Thanks to the gender data gap, we live in a world with a serious design flaw: it’s made for men. As long as we continue to assume the male gender and male needs are “standard,” we’ll continue to create a world that disenfranchises women. Addressing the gender data gap is an important step on the road to achieving gender equality. Actionable advice: Mind the gap! Now that you know about the gender data gap, make sure you’re not perpetuating it. Whether you’re designing a survey or chairing a decision-making meeting, actively seek out women’s input. And if you’re a woman, don’t be afraid to speak up about your experiences and needs! Vocalizing your needs, and the needs of other women, is one of the most constructive ways in which you can challenge the male default and work to correct the gender data gap. Got feedback?

In the 20 years since it was founded, it has completely redefined the way we interact online and with the world, even becoming a verb along the way. But is its tapestry of big data and free access really such a great thing? And will it be able to hold on to its position of power in the future? Because, as it turns out, though it holds data on almost everyone on the planet, it doesn’t actually keep it all under proper lock and key. But if Google’s heyday is coming to a close, then what will replace it? This is where cryptocurrencies, blockchain and bitcoin come in. These blinks detail the world that Google has built and why it’s no longer tenable, before explaining how and why the cryptocosm’s focus on security is changing, and will continue to change, the world. You’ll also learn what a “Siren Server” is; why you probably shouldn’t worry about Artificial Intelligence; and who Satoshi Nakamoto is – or isn’t. Of all the information giants on the market today, it is Google that has defined our current system of the world, the set of ideas that inform a society’s technology and institutions, and shape the lives of its citizens. Let’s start with Google’s vision of knowledge, which is built around big data. Google doesn’t use traditional methods for increasing knowledge, where step-by-step progress is made by working from previous ideas. Rather, its vision is to first gather all of the information in the world in one place – the cloud – before analyzing it using sophisticated algorithms and extract new information. To enable this, Google has built an enormous database of information, a digital rendition of the real world, starting with the internet before growing to include everything from books and languages to maps and even faces through facial recognition software, which you comb through when you use Google. And since Google wants access to all information, any sort of privacy runs contrary to its model. Next is Google’s vision of value. The company makes 95 percent of its revenue through advertising; instead of paying with money to use Google, you pay with your time and attention. Of course, most people don’t want to look at adverts – which explains why the use of ad blockers increased 102 percent between 2015 and 2016 alone. Google, however, is famously subtle, placing sponsored links at the top of searches where they blend in and don’t seem so obtrusive. To manage and facilitate the online architecture that all this data and advertising requires, Google has built their own enormous data center near the town of The Dalles, Oregon. It currently houses 75,000 computer servers and handles 3.5 billion searches per day – that’s 1.5 trillion every year! These servers have enabled Google to expand with web services like Gmail and Google Docs, while simultaneously creating a new yardstick for tech companies: the more storage and processing you can offer, the better you are. But is this really the case? Jaron Lanier, widely considered to be the inventor of virtual reality, refers to these huge centers as “Siren Servers,” invoking the Greek myth where sailors are drawn to their death on the rocks by the alluring song of the Siren bird-women. Is he right to call them so? Could these very same centers, which have given Google and others apparent market dominance, be pulling them toward an early grave? In January 2017, a “secret” gathering took place in Monterey Bay, California, attended by some of the pioneers of the information age, such as Google cofounder Larry Page. Their intention was to discuss and prepare to inform the world of the developing risks in the growing field of Artificial Intelligence, or AI. But most of the attendees were actually helping develop AI in Silicon Valley – why would they want to warn people of its dangers? These Silicon Valley pioneers believe that an AI-dominated future is inevitable. If they don’t develop it, someone else will. So the most good they can do is be involved and try to keep people informed of its dangers. But are these dangers real? To find out, we first need to look into the history of mathematics. In 1930, at a conference in his hometown of Königsberg, Germany (present-day Kaliningrad, Russia) mathematician David Hilbert presented the idea that all science could eventually be reduced to mathematics in a complete system – a system with a single unifying theory that covers everything, everywhere, with no uncertainty. However, the previous day at the same conference, the much younger mathematician Kurt Gödel had demonstrated that there can be no absolutely complete logical system. Any logical system, including any mathematical one, depends on premises that simply can’t be proved within it – you always need an outside authority. This is why humans can not only discover systems, they can create them too, and this is in fact how computer programming works: you create a system by defining rules for it from the outside. For AI to be dangerous in the way that Silicon Valley believes, AI would have to be a complete system. If it were to be complete, then once it had all the data in the world – a primary objective of Google, as we have seen – it could teach itself simply from the data it gathers, without the need for human input, quickly outpacing human intelligence and gaining dominance over us. But we needn’t fear this because, as Gödel demonstrated, all logical systems are incomplete. This means that if AI really is a threat, it must be programmed that way first. It couldn’t do it entirely on its own because it would need an outside authority – namely us humans, the ones who program it. All these fears of a tyrannical AI are really only the paranoid thoughts of scientists and engineers about the consequences of their own supposedly superior intelligence. In 2013, the Guatemalan Universidad Francisco Marroquín became the first university in the Americas to allow payments with the cryptocurrency bitcoin. This forward-facing move shows how some academic institutions are embracing progress more than others. Many American universities, on the other hand, would rather focus on reactionary measures that end up halting progress instead of enabling it. Harvard University, for example, has made several resolutions in recent years to combat climate change by distancing themselves from fossil fuels. But this is too focused on teaching students how to stop things instead of how to be innovative, look forward and come up with the solutions of the future. Other universities focus on nurturing their own reputation more than education. In the 20 years that Stephen Trachtenberg was president of George Washington State University, the price of tuition more than doubled from $27,000 to almost $60,000, with apparently no improvement of education standards and Trachtenberg claiming that a degree from the university serves instead as a “trophy.” Luckily, there are some institutions fighting against these trends. Named after founder and entrepreneur Peter Thiel, the Thiel Foundation awards the Thiel Fellowship, a $100,000 grant to encourage promising students in their early 20s or younger to quit college and pursue their own unique projects, with the aim of creating businesses and entrepreneurs rather than academics. It was led for its first five years by Danielle Strachman and Mike Gibson, who in 2015 together went on to found the 1517 Fund, a similar project that invests in Thiel Fellows and other young company founders. It’s named after the year that Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses on a church door in Wittenberg, Germany, which ignited the Reformation. In October 2017, the 1517 Fund posted their own “New 95.” These put forward the message that the education system wasn’t enabling scientific breakthroughs and progress, and should therefore be rebelled against. In 2013, the Thiel Fellowship was granted to Austin Russell for his company Luminar, which builds laser-radar chips vital for self-driving cars. In 2017, Toyota announced it would be purchasing chips from Luminar for its own cars. And in 2014, the fellowship was granted to Vitalik Buterin, a college dropout who attended the secret meeting in Monterey Bay mentioned in the previous blink, to help set up the blockchain platform Ethereum. This technology – blockchain – is set to change the world. But what exactly is it? In October 2008, a mysterious character known as Satoshi Nakamoto revealed the first cryptocurrency: the bitcoin, which has since come to steadily change the world we live in. To understand bitcoin, we need to dive into an emerging online world that the author calls the cryptocosm. In the cryptocosm, personal data is decentralized from any universal and easily targetable central hub, and is instead held by every individual. Each user has two keys specific to their online account, one public and one private. Whenever you send a message to a user, it is encrypted using the public key, but in such a way that it can only be deciphered with the user’s private key, so only they could ever read it. When they encrypt a response, they use their private key again, leaving a unique digital signature that proves their identity securely without revealing any personal information. These signatures are integral to bitcoin and its blockchain technology. Roughly every ten minutes, a block is created, which logs all the information about the most recent activity of bitcoins. This includes the digital signatures relevant to every transaction of bitcoin. It also includes a time-stamp, showing exactly when the block was made. The time-stamp is created through mining. A new block can only be created once a complicated and time-consuming algorithmic problem has been solved by using the processing power of many computers from across the network. This is mining. When it’s complete and the problem is solved, a proof of work is generated, which time-stamps the block that’s just been built. And, as compensation for the mining, new bitcoins are generated. Since the time-stamp can only be created once the mining has really been done, it can’t be forged. And since creating it involves many computers, it is verified by multiple users. This makes the information in the block trustworthy and unhackable. Bitcoins get around. Every transfer and creation of one is registered in the next block created. All of these blocks are connected in a chronological chain which is unsurprisingly called a blockchain, and which is public. Each block has a unique fingerprint and leaves traces in all subsequent blocks, meaning anyone can trace a bitcoin’s trajectory all the way back to when it was first created. The fingerprints also make it near impossible to edit the information inside any one block, since you’d have to edit all the previous blocks as well. Meaning that the bitcoin ledger – the record of all its transactions – is almost completely unhackable, and every transaction is thus very secure. No wonder so many businesses are pouncing on the technology! In 2016, Australian computer scientist and businessman Craig Steven Wright came out claiming that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Some believed him, but many remained skeptical. One of these skeptics argued that it would have been much easier for Wright to prove his identity by posting “Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto” with Satoshi’s private key than to try to convince people in person instead. For this reason, it was considered unlikely that Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto. Who was this young skeptic calling out the supposed creator of bitcoin? None other than the college dropout we learned about earlier: 24-year-old Vitalik Buterin, founder of another important blockchain company: Ethereum. Ethereum launched in 2015 and is a blockchain app platform designed to securely handle and verify objects other than just cryptocurrencies, most notably smart contracts. With smart contracts, the parties involved in a transaction send their assets – be it shares, currency or anything else of value – via the blockchain. As long as all parties comply, the assets are then released and transferred on accordingly; otherwise, they’re just refunded. Just two years after Ethereum’s launch, it had enabled a wave of entrepreneurial creativity via these secure investment capabilities, sidestepping cumbersome regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission that had slowed investment in recent years. It also has its own coin on the platform, ether, which in May 2018 had a market cap close to $60 billion – already almost half that of bitcoin! It’s too early to tell if Ethereum will outrun bitcoin, but the Greek-British blockchain scholar Andreas Antonopoulos says it might end up like a rivalry between a lion and a shark, where each dominates its own domain. But Ethereum isn’t the only other blockchain enterprise flourishing in the cryptocosm. The company Blockstack, led by computer scientist Muneeb Ali, is building an entirely new network for decentralized blockchain apps. Blockstack is both a browsable network and an open-source platform for app development using blockchain technology, allowing both developers and users an easy way into the secure world of blockchains. It’s built on just two key software structures – a monolith, a blockchain software underpinning everything, and a metaverse, a visible platform where users create, surf and share as they see fit. This is just one way that the blockchain is giving security and power back to individual users. But it’s not just software that’s standing up to Google’s dominance; there’s change brewing in the hardware sector as well. In computer science, Moore’s Law dictates that the cost-effectiveness of circuits doubles every two years, while its corollary, Bell’s Law, states that every ten years, a huge drop in the price of processing power causes the development of a brand new computer architecture. It happened when the PC replaced the huge mainframes of IBM in the 70s and 80s, then more recently with Google’s cloud. Are we due for another shift soon? In Silicon Valley, it seems to be arriving in a rebirth of hardware manufacturing. Though many Valley companies are no longer building the silicon chips that gave the area its name, some such as Nvidia and their chief scientist Bill Dally still are. However, they are moving in a different direction, away from fast but energy-demanding “hot” chips to cooler and more efficient ones, enabled by the cheaper circuitry now available. Dally has long championed the capabilities of graphics processors and their parallel processing systems, where multiple functions gently yet efficiently run at once, rather than having all data moving rapidly up and down a single information highway. He believes these types of processors could be crucial in emerging fields such as sensors for self-driving cars, where life and death depends on analyzing and interpreting many different objects and events simultaneously. Google and other information giants, meanwhile, are still stuck on the task of achieving cheaper and more powerful processing power to support their massive and growing centralized servers. In fact, it seems that they’re demanding more extra power than is actually feasible in the current technological landscape. But for technologies that do not use centralized clouds, there are exciting developments happening. One is the emergence of the company Golem, built on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Describing itself as an “Airbnb for computers,” Golem rents your computer processing power when you’re not using it and pools it all into one enormous virtual-supercomputer! This creates huge processing power, allowing users to perform normally expensive processes such as computer-graphics rendering for much cheaper, and without requiring the massive and expensive hubs of Siren Servers like Google’s. And individual storage and software is kept secure by use of blockchain technology. Such shifts in technology are improving security and capability. Is there anything that could really slow down the rise of the blockchain? In the eighteenth century, the British physicist Isaac Newton established the gold standard. For almost 200 years, governments worldwide guaranteed their currencies against the value of gold, in a bid to ensure economic stability. Why gold? Well, for starters, it is the most resistant to corrosion of the precious metals, so you can be fairly sure it won’t disappear. And its value is predictable too, since its supply, through mining and excavation worldwide, increases gradually enough so as to have barely any effect on its worth. And while mining technology may improve, it’s essentially canceled out by the fact that new gold deposits are harder and harder to access. So it made for a useful standard – an unchanging touchstone against which to stabilize the volatile international economic elements of exchange rates and interest rates. But governments have since abandoned it, instead preferring to let the markets decide the value of currencies. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Nakamoto promised to change this, hoping that bitcoin could become a new and improved gold standard. Along with the first bitcoin block, Nakamoto created a mining algorithm, which makes it harder and harder to solve the algorithmic problem required to create blocks and their corollary bitcoins. In this way, he hoped to offset the improvement of computer processing power, much like the increasing inaccessibility of gold deposits offsets technological advances. He also capped the total supply of bitcoins at 21 million, with the mineable amount being halved every year. With these caveats, Satoshi hoped to create a stable and predictable supply of bitcoins over time, thus allowing it to become a new gold standard. But, according to economics blogger Mike Kendall, bitcoin can’t become a standard because it’s already a token of exchange, and a volatile one at that. Because its supply is fixed, the only way it can react to changes in demand is by wild fluctuations in its value. And this has already happened: between 2017 and 2018, bitcoin’s value ranged from $1,183 to a peak of $19,401. With this in mind, how could bitcoin act as a predictable and stable standard? Satoshi may have made amazing technological advances in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but his understanding of real-world economics may be flawed. It’s up to other cryptocurrencies to fix the remaining mistakes and continue to build the cryptocosm, thus paving a way out of the cluttered and extensive systems of Google. The key message in these blinks: Google has built a world where individual security comes second to the data storage of a centralized hub. But its dominance now seems to be reaching a tipping point. By working outside of the dominant and traditional systems, the cryptocosm along with the blockchain has laid the foundation for a completely new way of protecting individual data and conducting online business. It can potentially pull apart the cluttered and exhaustive systems of Google while enabling progress and technological change in many fields. Got feedback?

In its early days, when the internet was painfully slow and nerds made homepages with pictures of their dogs, few saw its real potential. Fast forward 20 years and it’s almost impossible to imagine a life without the internet. It has made its way into every facet of modern life, from the way we find information and consume products, to how we socialize. In short, it’s magic. And yet, as we’ve immersed ourselves in this brave new online world, we can’t help but feel a strange sense of loss: there’s something uncanny about our Facebook friends’ profile pictures, and although we can listen to any music we want whenever we want, there’s a nagging nostalgia when we think back to the time when every record we bought really meant something. This tension between the magic and the loss is what these blinks are all about. In these blinks, you’ll learn why games and apps can make us less able to cope with the real world; how our compulsive reading could kill us (and others); and how Steve Jobs changed the way we listen to music. The internet, in all its never-ending chaos, can be a bit jarring at times. Loud, annoying ads lurk behind every click and an incessant stream of spam seems to pour onto your screen. But somewhere in this madness, people manage to find beauty and peace. That’s in large part due to well-designed mobile applications, or apps, which counterbalance the internet’s messy side – a side that is to be expected in a world that’s more connected than ever. After all, billions of people around the world are online, posting, commenting and linking. Such high traffic means the internet is jammed, chaotic and busy. And that’s where the brilliant graphic design of well-made apps, free of any confusing words or unnecessary visuals, comes in to provide an oasis from the internet’s wild storm. Just take the puzzle game app, Hundreds. It doesn’t require any wordy explanations like “when you do x, y will happen.” It simply explains itself through graphics. But such apps or games that are easily understandable through intelligently designed graphics can also keep us from fully learning to cope with the more mundane aspects of life, like boredom, stress and disorder. These apps offer a convenient pause from the stress and hassle of daily routines. For instance, how many times have you reached for your phone and the comfort of Angry Birds to take refuge, far away from the noise of your office? Such dependency is problematic because, if people always seek such escapes, they’ll miss out on essential learning opportunities, like how to tolerate things that lack instant gratification: waiting in long lines, listening to lengthy or boring lectures and persisting at a monotonous but essential task. When people think of “reading,” they tend to visualize someone poring over a book or newspaper. But actually, scrolling through Facebook posts or checking matches on Tinder is another kind of reading, one that we do nonstop. The internet has taught us that we don’t know enough, compelling us to read all the time, wherever we are – even if it almost kills us. This is only logical since the web is packed to the gills with information, most of which we can access relatively easily. But looking at the internet only serves to reinforce how little we know about the world, people, great music, international politics and all manner of other topics. This realization compels us to frantically read in an attempt to catch up with the overwhelming and constantly growing amount of knowledge that we feel ourselves to be lacking. In fact, we’re so consumed with reading that we readily risk our lives, as well as those of others by, for instance, checking our news feeds while blindly crossing the street. In short, technology is swamping us with knowledge – but this doesn’t have to be the case. Technology could be a powerful tool to help us handle all the information it puts at our fingertips, and even do some of the thinking for us. For instance, the alien nature of machines might scare some people, but it’s possible that, some day, we won’t have to think or worry about the things we don’t know or can’t decide on. We might not even need to read or learn since machines will be able to do all those things for us. If that day comes, we’ll no longer have to worry about major international dilemmas, like the right way to respond to the war in Syria, or even figure out minor confusions, like whether avocado or cucumber make a better facial mask. When was the last time you sent an emoticon in a text? If you’re like most people, it probably wasn’t too long ago, and the popularity of these symbols points toward a more generalized phenomenon: the language we use today is far more visual than that used before the dawn of the internet. As a result, people include tons of pictures, graphs and icons in their daily communication. Just think of the countless smiley faces, GIFs and memes you find popping up all over your phone and computer. Or consider Instagram, Flickr, Pinterest, Snapchat and the innumerable other visually-based social media networks; they’re all platforms created for the express purpose of digitally sharing visual content. But as these new visual forms of communication gained traction, the traditional function of photography fell by the wayside. Photoshopping now tempts people to present enhanced versions of themselves, and their lives, to a vast online audience. This represents a marked change from how photography used to function. Just a few decades ago, photography was all about the faithful documentation of an event for those who weren’t there to see it. For instance, if you couldn’t make it to your family vacation or missed out on your class reunion, someone could at least show you photos of what the experience had looked like. Then the technology changed. All of a sudden, everyone had a smartphone with a built-in camera. These accessible, on-the-go cameras opened up endless possibilities, like taking a selfie and editing out anything you find undesirable about your image. Not only that, but with apps like Instagram and Flickr, people began adding filters to their photos, happily embellishing the reality they present online, rather than objectively documenting it. Did you know that for each minute you’ve spent in these blinks, 100 hours worth of video have been uploaded to YouTube? YouTube has become vastly popular, and for all those people who used to be restricted by their amateur videography, online video has a solution: the producers are now the people who create the platforms for consumers – who are also producers – to create content for themselves. This is a major shift since, only a few years ago, the great producers of cinema were, for the most part, the only ones who had the privilege of telling stories. But today, the great “producers” are the creators of platforms that enable everyday people to share their stories. These platforms opened up a fantastic opportunity for people to share their online movies. And you don’t need to be Woody Allen or Roman Polanski to tell your story through video; just about anyone can make and share them. In the case of YouTube, it’s simple to tell a story, regardless of your background. You need only shoot it, upload it and wait for the views to roll in. This is the quintessential illustration of the way consumers have become the producers of their own content. And with this change in roles came a change in content, since a YouTube video is a medium in and of itself. Unlike traditional films, these videos are unencumbered by the rules of genre and range from pet videos to extreme sport stunts (and fails) to DIY tutorials and even snippets of TV shows and movies. Essentially, YouTube is whatever you want it to be. Can you remember Napster or Limewire, those anarchic programs that let you share music files with people around the world? Well, those days of the young internet’s piracy are long gone. Now you don’t have to wait forever to download a song, only to realize you got the wrong version. In recent years, iTunes has made music more accessible than ever. One of the genius inventions of Steve Jobs’ company Apple, this platform lets people access and purchase music of all types with ease. As a result, it’s much easier to listen to your favorite songs – and the best part is, everyone has access. You simply go to the store, search for the music of your choice, push “purchase” and, before you know it, you’re listening to your favorite song on whatever device you want. But while they may be convenient, devices like iPods aren’t necessarily the best choice for listening to music, especially because of their inherent antisocial element. After all, the music people listen to on devices like this isn’t “real” music; rather, it’s a mere digital representation of it. In other words, when you listen to an .mp3, you’re not listening to the strings of a guitar being plucked or a drum being beaten, or even an acoustic reproduction of it, as would be the case on a vinyl record. On the other hand, people perceive it as music. So why doesn’t it feel completely right? Some people hypothesize that this is due to iTunes being a medium of hit singles rather than whole albums, which presents a more fractured listening experience. Others suspect that it’s a result of how .mp3s are compressed to filter out any seemingly extraneous sounds. But the main reason that an iPod doesn’t quite hit home is that listening to music used to be a shared experience. By putting in your earbuds, you’re actively shutting out everyone around you. The key message in this book: The internet is a massive treasure trove containing everything you’ve ever wanted. It has enabled the sharing of information like never before and has become an utterly indispensable aspect of our lives. However, this accessibility has its costs as well, namely ones of a social variety. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

In fact, without giving it much thought, we are all constantly using a myriad of different materials, all of which make up our modern world. So, how can we begin to understand this expanding and increasingly complex use of materials?  In these blinks, you’ll take a journey through the evolution of human material uses, and learn which principle materials should be taken into consideration when we analyze the basic building blocks of the world today.  You’ll learn about the extraction and production of materials, and how material consumption is a major cause of environmental pollution, which we can help by reducing our current material dependence. You’ll also learn what the quintessential twentieth century material is; how many tons of paper were used to design the Boeing 747 airplane;  why we’ll never run out of sand or silicon. From the production of clothes to houses to all manner of electronics, the sheer variety of materials used by modern-day humans is dizzying. But how can we determine which materials to take into account when analyzing our modern material flow? Well, no human material use survey would be complete without considering agricultural and forestry-derived products, as well as metals, industrial gases and non-renewable organics.  Back in 1882, the US Geological Survey, or USGS, began preparations for one of the first reports on material flows ever conducted for an entire country. Their survey grouped materials into major categories and covered the period between 1900 and 1995. The categories, of course, included all raw materials derived from agriculture, including cotton, seeds, wool and tobacco; everything the forest industry produced, like wood and paper; and finally metals, minerals and non-renewable organics derived from fossil fuels, like asphalt, waxes and oils.  To these, the author would suggest adding industrial gases, because such materials are essential to our modern methods of production. Other than that, USGS classifications are still valid today. So, breaking material surveys down into such categories is a long-standing procedure; but it only works because it only assesses raw organic materials that are designated for further processing, while omitting oxygen, water, food, fuel and all hidden material flows. Hidden material flows are all the materials extracted during a production cycle that don’t end up in finished products, like all the earth and rocks that are moved to reach a mineral deposit. Materials like this would actually account for the vast majority of total material flow in countries with large mineral-extracting industries. So, water isn’t listed for quantitative reasons, because it would overshadow practically all other materials; leaving oxygen off the list makes sense because it’s practically an inexhaustible element of the earth’s atmosphere; and food as well as fuel are excluded because they have historically been analyzed separately, and aren’t quite materials but instead finished products.  You need only watch a bird building a nest to know that humans aren’t the only creatures to use materials in creative ways. But what is unique to human material use is its overall extent and complexity – a fact that dates back to prehistory. The prehistoric, ancient and medieval eras were characterized by the use of wood, stone and metal, respectively. In prehistoric times, people produced hammers, axes, arrows and knives by expertly selecting stones for well-tailored manufacturing processes. However, wooden sticks were still used to dig for roots and hunt small animals.  Then, during antiquity and the Middle Ages, stone’s durability made it the material of choice for everything from utilitarian construction, like aqueducts and roads, to funerary structures and ceremonial monuments like temples and statues. But wood remained crucial as the sole material used for constructing the hulls and masts of seafaring ships.  And while the most important material development of antiquity was by far the ability to smelt metals like copper, bronze and iron, no material was as common in preindustrial societies as wood. It’s easy to see why when you consider all the timber used for buildings, and the wooden components essential to tools.  Today, we use mostly metals and plastics, but paper and textiles are still essential. In fact, alongside rapid growth in the consumption of metals, modernization has seen vast increases in the extraction of traditional construction materials like wood and stone.  For instance, steel products dominated new markets because of their unprecedented strength and durability, while copper became the metal of choice for wires and cables.  And while it’s unquestionable that the quintessential material of the twentieth century is plastic, which replaced wood and metals in countless household and industrial products, two other materials deserve mention.  First, paper’s mass production was revolutionized at the dawn of the nineteenth century with the invention of the continuous paper-making machine. Second, textile production was crucial because mechanized weaving paved the way for the mass production of fabric. With new roads built daily and countless packages mailed every hour, the day to day of modern society relies on a never-ending and highly diverse supply of materials. But which material categories are most important? There are six in total. The first two major groups of modern materials are biomaterials, and those used for construction.  The first, biomaterials, consists of things as diverse as lumber, straw, cotton, wool, beeswax and natural rubber. While our consumption of many of these naturally derived materials has seen a steady decline as synthetic substitutes become increasingly prevalent, two biomaterials, namely wood and cotton, remain extremely valuable.  The second material category that prevails in the modern world, construction materials, is currently dominated by all manner of sand, stones, cements and concretes. For example, brick production has climbed to unprecedented global levels due to China’s impressive construction projects.  The third and fourth categories are metals and plastics. In the twentieth century, the growth of industrialization, advances in transportation, mechanization and the boom of mass consumption fostered a burgeoning demand for metals of all kinds. The same was true for plastic products, as they’re especially essential to packaging, construction, electronics manufacturing and the auto industry.  Another major material category of our time, and one indispensable to society as we know it, is industrial gases, with oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen being the three most important. Why are they so crucial? Becauses gases like these play critical roles in just about every major sector of the modern economy. For instance, without industrial gases, the efficient production of steel would be impossible. The final material category that’s crucial to our modern modes of production is electronics, along with the material essential to the production of most consumer electronics, silicon. In fact, ever since Intel’s release of the first microprocessor in 1971, a device built with silicon, our current era has been defined as the Silicon Age. Do you know where the different components of your smartphone came from? Well, in the case of Apple's iPhone 5, the constituent parts were made by over 20 different companies, operating factories in 12 countries spread over three continents!  While the iPhone isn't the only product with such a complicated assembly pattern, it's a prime example of how material accounting can quickly become a challenge. You can imagine how such a complex production process would make it difficult to keep a simple record of each individual material used; a better strategy is to focus on national material flows.  For instance, if you look at the United States’ material flows, you’ll see increasing material consumption across every category, a marked decline in the relative role of biomaterials and the increasing importance of recycling.  Another way to approach material-flow accounting is by employing a life-cycle assessment, or LCA. An LCA works by quantifying the environmental impacts of materials over the course of their entire lifespan. Armed with this information, you can make decisions by choosing the materials with the lowest environmental impact.  For example, when paving a sidewalk, which material would you imagine to be the least environmentally impactful, natural granite or modern concrete?  Actually, because of the energy required to cut and transport the stone, a granite sidewalk can have anywhere from 25 to 140 percent more impact than one made of concrete!  Employing LCAs can also reveal the increasing role of recycling in reducing environmental repercussions.  Did you know that recycling itself is actually a highly desirable flow? This is because we use billions of tons of materials every year, and recycling can do everything from drastically increase the lifetime of known mineral reserves, to decrease the demand for new biomaterials, or even increase the utility of materials that are transformed into finished products.  Plus, recycling can also save loads of energy while reducing environmental impacts. If you looked up the verb “dematerialize” you’d think that it holds supernatural connotations: the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as becoming free of physical substance. However, for our purposes, dematerialization isn’t about completely eliminating a material, but rather making substantial reductions in the use of materials.  For instance, consider how much less paper the world consumes since the computerization of archives. Keeping this definition in mind, it’s important to know that every form of dematerialization involves complex material substitutions. For example, the design and development of the now-ubiquitous Boeing 747 aircraft, an airplane that was conceived in 1965 and launched in 1969, involved approximately 75,000 drawings, which amounted to the use of nearly eight tons of paper! In the 1970s, seeing the huge material waste, Boeing developed a CAD, or computer aided design system. Their database eventually held over a million drawings and made paper unnecessary for both large or small blueprints.  But building and maintaining electronic designs requires a complex infrastructure of modern computing, massive amounts of data storage and tons of servers to handle all that data traffic. Therefore, for the dematerialization of paper to occur, a wide variety of other materials are required to build computers and supply them with energy.  In addition, general dematerialization has actually led to an increase in total material consumption! Using materials sparingly doesn’t necessarily mean lower consumption levels; just take the evolution of cars as an example. Dematerialization, as is evident in the increasingly efficient use of metals, has been a major driver of falling costs, greater affordability and the mass accessibility of cars.  Or consider consumer products like cell phones; the steadily decreasing mass and therefore cost of such commonplace consumer items has meant an increase in their use. This has fostered steep increases in demand for the materials these products are made of, like light metals, plastics, glasses and, of course, silicon. Increasing populations and improved quality of life have meant a steadily rising demand for materials across the board. But how long can and will this trend continue? And in the face of such increases, how can we limit material consumption? First of all, the world runs no risk of exhausting its supply of any major material. That’s because the ones common to construction like sand, clay and stone are tremendously plentiful, meaning there’s no threat of a shortage. Also, supplies of silicon, the electronic age’s signature material are comparably abundant.  In fact, there isn’t a material in existence that could be exploited completely; well before such a state is reached, the costs of extracting a resource from insane depths or sparse deposits would make its mining economically unviable.  But that’s not the only good news – there’re also plenty of simple opportunities for waste reduction. For instance, we can cut material use by adopting better designs. The easiest way is by using less material in packaging to reverse the trend of overpackaged consumer items so common in affluent modern societies. Another way to cut waste is through more rational and less wasteful manufacturing. And of course, there’s always the opportunity for more effective recycling. In fact, recycling-friendly design could prove especially important in the management of our increasing piles of e-waste.  OK, so now that we know our material future is secure, what can we expect from the materials of tomorrow? Well, there are some promising new materials that will find countless applications in several major industries. Take graphene, a recently developed, two-dimensional carbon fabric that’s just one atom thick. This futuristic cloth boasts both formidable mechanical strength and incredibly high electric and thermal conductivity. It could be used in everything from coatings and transparent conductive layers to high-frequency transistors.  New plastics are also being developed that are 100 percent biodegradable, meaning they can be broken down by microorganisms into nothing but water and carbon dioxide! The key message in this book: Our modern world consumes a tremendous quantity and variety of materials; the material demands of our economy are increasing everyday. Therefore, it’s essential to use materials more efficiently while advancing recycling and waste reduction methods to ensure we can meet the demands of the future.

But is that an accurate picture? Stories of privacy invading, data hoarding and increasing profits of media companies, while artists and producers struggle to get by, tarnish the picture. According to author Jonathan Taplin, if we’re to continue thriving, we need to heed the warnings and take a step back from allowing giant monopolies to be the gatekeepers of our information. The healthier thing to do for our society would be to respect the artists, and not treat their work as something disposable to enjoy free of charge. So let’s take a look behind the curtain of Silicon Valley and find out what’s really going on. In these blinks, you’ll learn which government-funded programs laid the groundwork for the internet; why Google is in favor of online piracy; and how a group of photographers may have a winning distribution model. What is it that brings technology and innovation to the world? Is it always some smart, creative and profit-seeking entrepreneur toiling away in their garage? Sometimes it’s government funding and the public sector that comes up with innovation. Take the internet, for example; the technology that brought this indispensable tool to life was created in 1968 by an American engineer named Doug Engelbart. That year, Engelbart unveiled his NLS system –  or “oN-Line System” – which incorporated windows, graphics, video conferencing, the mouse, word processing, and a collaborative real-time editor. But Engelbart didn’t do this all on his own. He was funded by DARPA, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was established in the US to develop innovative projects with the potential for future military use. Engelbart’s NLS became the foundation for ARPANET – the very first online network for sending and receiving data – making it an early version of the internet. ARPANET was also the first to use the TCP/IP protocol suite, also created thanks to DARPA funding. TCP/IP is still used today as the standard template for packaging and sending data, enabling all connected computers on a network to understand one another. A lot of the foundational technology we use today wasn’t motivated by profit, but rather through government-sponsored incentives, with Bell Labs being another example of this. At the beginning of the twentieth century, many communications companies were competing for business with their own systems, leading to an unruly, tangled mess of cables strung along the streets of many US cities. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed Bell System and Western Union to consolidate and absorb the smaller companies into one unified system. The FCC had one important stipulation: communication rates would be regulated, and a certain amount of profits had to be spent on research and innovation that would benefit society. In 1925 Bell Labs was founded with the express intent of developing that innovation. It went on to invent the transistor, the microchip, cell telephones and countless other technologies we use everyday, thanks to government programs made possible by tax dollars. So how did we come to believe that it’s the free market and the profit-driven tech industry that’s good for innovation, while governments are considered an intrusive force that’s bad for business? Let’s find out... The idea of a big bad government can be traced in part to a generation of libertarians born in the US in the 1980s. Many of them were inspired by the works of novelist Ayn Rand and the economic philosophy of Milton Friedman. As such, they were committed to opposing government regulations and taxation, under Rand’s premise that selfishness and a survival of the fittest ethos are beneficial for society. One of the most significant guiding forces for libertarianism in the tech world is Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal. Peter Thiel fell in love with libertarianism as a teenager by reading and rereading the works of Ayn Rand. As a result, Thiel uses a quote from Rand’s book, The Fountainhead, as a central tenet of his business: “Who will stop me?” When Thiel founded PayPal in 1998, it was part of his libertarian philosophy to disrupt the rule of banks and credit card companies, while avoiding government regulations and escaping taxes. Thiel’s principles spread rapidly through Silicon Valley, particularly once Ebay purchased PayPal for $1 billion in 2002. Soon, Thiel’s self-branded “Paypal Mafia” was taking over, as former Paypal employees went on to form YouTube, LinkedIn and Yelp, all companies that have helped shape the online landscape. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, follows much the same ethos and is someone who has benefited greatly from the tenets of libertarianism. In particular, Bezos has been taking advantage of a 1992 ruling by the Supreme Court which states that a company does not have to pay state taxes if there’s no physical store or other tangible presence in that state. So while people in Arkansas can buy things from Amazon, because the company has no physical store there, it doesn’t have to pay state taxes; allowing Bezos to undercut local competition. This is a significant reason why Amazon has been able to help put 5,400 local book and record shops out of business in the US between 1992 and 2015. It’s not just Bezos who’s dodging taxes: Facebook and Google are also using their lack of a physical presence to avoid paying Uncle Sam, and, as a result, it’s estimated that the US is losing out on approximately $60 billion in tax revenue each year. As we’ll see in the next few blinks, the tech industry’s insidious libertarian ethics have also given rise to harmful monopolies that are taking over the internet. Today, Google has an 88 percent market share on all searches and advertising, while Facebook has a 77 percent share of social media. Why aren’t there rules against such monopolizing? To answer this, we need to go all the way back to the founding fathers. While a visiting dignitary in Europe, Thomas Jefferson got a first-hand account of how much damage a monopoly can cause by witnessing the terrible effect the East India Trading Company had on Britain. The company had become so powerful that they were the ones writing the legislation that controlled the nation’s trade routes. Their philosophy of profits above all else resulted in the 10 million deaths caused by the Great Bengal Famine of 1770, after forcing farmers to grow heroin instead of food. Despite Thomas Jefferson’s best efforts, the Bill of Rights did not include protections against monopolies. Alexander Hamilton believed capital should be allowed to control politics – not the other way around. While Jefferson was wary of the power that a proposed National Bank could wield, Hamilton championed the financial institution: the government only owned 20 percent of the bank’s shares, while the rest were monopolized by private interests like Hamilton and his rich friends. This is a large part of why founding documents, like the Bill of Rights, never included protection against harmful monopolies. A century later, in 1890, one such document finally did come to pass: the Sherman Act. It stated that anyone attempting to monopolize any area of trade could be subject to fines and imprisonment. Teddy Roosevelt used the law to break up the proposed merger of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil and J.P. Morgan’s Northern Securities. According to Roosevelt, when a small number of immensely rich people work together for the sole purpose of securing wealth and power, it hurts the nation and free enterprise. While this was a move in the right direction, the judge and legal scholar Robert Bork proceeded to take the US a big step backward. Bork had made a name for himself in the 1960s as a teacher at the Yale Law School, where he gave lectures on antitrust law. He said that consumer welfare was the ultimate measure of an economy – in Bork’s economic perspective monopolies were ultimately beneficial to consumers, so antitrust laws were therefore harmful. His teachings were so popular that he would go on to work for both the Nixon and Ford administrations, during which time Sherman Act filings dropped considerably – great news for big corporations. Today, Bork’s theories still dominate the antitrust division of the Justice Department – the federal branch responsible for policing the marketplace and ensuring fair play. As of 2017, the 62 richest people on the Forbes Top 400 list have as much wealth as the poorest 50 percent of the world’s population. It’s also worth noting that eight of the top ten wealthiest people made their money from technology. One way of making money on the internet is by charging rent. In economic terms, rent is the money earned when someone controls a scarce and desirable commodity; such as the advertising space controlled by Google. Since Google controls so much of what internet users are exposed to, they can set the rates for how much advertisers are charged. Likewise, Amazon controls a significant amount of the book and publishing industry; as a result, they can demand exorbitant rates from publishers who can’t afford not to advertise to Amazon’s customers. These are just two bigger examples of how huge tech firms get rich through rent-seeking. Another way to boost profits is using their size and power to put pressure on Washington. If we judge size by market capital (or the total value of a company’s shares), Google is the largest company in the US. It controls five of the most popular web platforms, as well as all but one of the top 14 online commercial functions, and uses this impressive technological dominance to influence government legislation: each year Google spends $15 million on lobbying. What’s perhaps more worrisome is the impact Google has on forming public opinion. In 2012, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was proposed in Congress, with full support from the entertainment industry. On Google’s homepage that year, it encouraged users to “tell Congress” to vote against SOPA. Why? Because searching for illegally pirated songs and videos is a big part of Google’s business. This message was viewed by an estimated 1.8 billion people, many of whom flooded the email servers of congressional representatives until the bill was finally withdrawn. Google also has significant sway over regulators, thanks in part to the many former Google employees working in the federal government: at one time or another, 53 people have worked for both Google and the White House. In 2005, an enterprising man named Kim Dotcom launched Megaupload; a website that allowed anyone to upload a movie or music file while giving bonuses to those who uploaded large numbers of files. In just two years, Dotcom’s service collected around 12 billion unique files, earning over $174 million in revenue. Megaupload users accounted for 4 percent of global internet traffic due primarily to the sharing of pirated content. But Megaupload was just the start: by 2015, the International Chamber of Commerce estimated the value of counterfeit goods shared around the world at $1.7 trillion – over 2 percent of the world’s total economic output. So who is profiting from this trillion dollar business? The only certainty is that it’s not the ones actually making the goods. Since the dawn of internet piracy, many artists who used to make a comfortable living from royalties have struggled to get by. Take Levon Helm – drummer and singer in The Band, who also played with Bob Dylan in the 1960s. Helm was never one of the giant rock stars, but due to their enduring popularity, members of The Band were able to live comfortably off the royalties from their albums. Then, in 2000, the file-sharing platform Napster arrived, and everything changed. Seemingly overnight, Helm and the other member of The Band who didn’t get songwriting credits saw their royalties drop from around $100,000 per year to almost nothing. Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1990, and though it caused him great pain to sing, he had to begin playing live in order to drum up the money for his medical costs. Helm is far from the only one in such a circumstance. The Interactive Advertising Bureau has estimated that pirated content costs each entertainment industry around $2 billion per year. It also estimates that, if pirated content were to be eliminated, an extra $456 million would be generated each year just through the advertising of legitimate content. The irony is that people are listening to more music and watching more movies, and yet many of the artists producing these works are making less money than ever before. There’s a new saying in today’s connected world: If you’re not the customer, you’re the product. It‘s a phrase that suggests no part of the internet isn’t doing some sort of business. That business often involves the collection of data, and it’s companies like Google and Facebook that are at the forefront of this data-harvesting. A lot of people still see Google as a friendly company offering a free service to help them find what they’re looking for. But the reality is that every time you use Google, they’re collecting as much data from you as they can, which they in turn sell to someone else. When Google launched Gmail, it was an instant success. A free email service with unlimited storage! What most users aren’t aware of is that the cost of this service – Google scans every message to customize the ads it shows you. If people knew this when they signed up, it’s likely there’d be a lot fewer users. Like other harvesters, Google goes after the data and worries about the repercussions later. This is why it took them two years to provide Gmail with a delete button. And it’s why they didn’t ask permission before photographing everyone’s property and matching it to an address when creating their Street View feature on Google Maps. Facebook is another company that capitalizes on your personal information, with little care about being responsible with it. Their motto used to be “move fast and break things” – meaning they’ll worry about cleaning up their mess later. Facebook’s popularity stems from allowing people to present an idealized version of themselves while harnessing a person’s basic desire to be “liked.” This has resulted in 1.23 billion regular users, all of whom generate endless amounts of content and personal data. In 2014, Facebook users generated data for an average of 17 minutes a day. If we multiply that by the 1.23 billion users, that’s about 40,000 years worth of data every day, and 15 million years of data in just 2014 alone. Unfortunately, Facebook has a pretty poor user privacy record. In 2007 they created Beacon, an app that notified your friends if you bought something on a partner site. But Beacon was an opt-out service, meaning you had to find out about it and turn it off if you didn’t want all your friends to know about your purchases. Naturally, people were pretty upset about Beacon, though Facebook refused to disable it until they had several weeks worth of data. Is it possible to have an open internet without massive, invasive and corrupting tech corporations? Can we stop the giants? The answer is: Yes we can. But first we need to cooperate – after all, cooperation has been at the heart of humanity’s success so far, and it can continue to help us now. Our earliest ancestors thrived because they cooperated. Some hunted while others kept the fire burning at the shelter, and it’s this sort of cooperation that would continue to see us prosper. Many areas throughout America were hit hard by the decline in manufacturing jobs. One town in particular was Chattanooga, Tennessee. But fortune seemed to smile upon the town. After establishing a smart grid that would suit their need, the Volkswagen car company built a manufacturing plant there. This arrangement had the added benefit of creating a high-speed fiber optic network for the town’s residents. The problem was, this would ruin the monopoly that Comcast had on the area’s internet, so the media giant tried to sue the city and shut down the grid. Having a powerful corporation like Comcast threaten your city might scare some, but Chattanooga's community banded together and their spirit won the day and they got to keep their grid. So communities working together is key in fighting these large companies. Another powerful tool is art and literature. It can shed light on our oppressors and make us see how we need to fight back. Take Aldous Huxley’s 1932 novel, Brave New World. It describes a future with so much readily available information that it is treated like overwhelming, irrelevant noise. People no longer read, and facts are considered no more than trivial pieces of instant gratification. Sound familiar? Huxley’s work of fiction is now dangerously close to being factual, as we find ourselves on the precipice of information overload. It’s writers like Huxley that can sound the alarm, reminding us of where we’re heading if we don’t take action and resist before it’s too late. But we still need a well considered strategy... Although the internet has proven less than helpful to many of the artists who find their work being illegally distributed, it may also be the platform that allows them to take back control of their futures. In recent years streaming services like Netflix and Spotify have become increasingly popular, though they’ve been quite bad at generating income for artists. But there may be a way for artists to band together to fix this. Both have attracted large numbers of customers through charging small membership fees. This adds up to a lot of money, and while these services have a business model that costs them nothing to add more customers, the question remains as to how the revenue – such as the $558.9 million that Netflix made in 2017 – will make its way to the artists. To date, streaming sites like Netflix have been very secretive about the deals they make with production companies, so that they can continue to have the advantage in negotiations. However, through cooperation, it may be possible to put the advantage back into the hands of artists and creators. Cooperatives such as Magnum Photos – formed at the end of WWII by a group of twelve photographers – are still going strong today. Members of this co-op have retained the right to their works, rather than signing them over to publishers. This has allowed the photographers to continue making money from their art, and sell the same photos to different publications around the world. This kind of artist-controlled arrangement is something that musicians could benefit from as well: A band could debut their album on Bandcamp – which takes roughly 15 percent of the earned revenue – then a month later they can release it on Spotify Premium, which takes roughly 30 percent. A month after that the album can be permitted to play on the free versions of Spotify and Youtube, which take far more. Eager fans won’t wait, so they’ll pay the cost of buying from Bandcamp, while more casual fans would wait for the streaming version. If artists had this kind of control, they’d no doubt see a better payday, but the only way they’ll take the power away from dominant forces like Spotify and Google is if they band together as part of an artist-run co-op. Though the corporations are calling the shots now, there is still hope for a fairer future. All we need to do is join forces and take control of our destinies. The key message in this book: Many giant tech companies are fueled by a libertarian ideology that has kept billions of dollars away from the governments that initially funded the technology. With their unethical dominance of the marketplace, they’ve nurtured an illegal distribution system that has kept billions of dollars out of the hands of artists, musicians and other creators of high-quality content. They’ve also gained a dangerous amount of influence with politicians, while increasing their reach into the private lives of internet users. This has led to negative consequences that threaten to control our access to information, while severely damaging the livelihood of artists and the entertainment industries. If there’s to be a way forward, it will require communities of like-minded professionals, artists and citizens to take back control of their online lives and work. Got feedback?

Even though we’ve been living in a giant soup of algorithms, content and data for only a few years, the time before digital connectivity now feels oddly foreign and remote. Bound up in our new world is the hazy concept of power – and even that’s changing. Technology is instigating a shift away from hierarchical old power to more democratized, accessible forms of new power. This is changing how the world behaves but also how we behave.    In order to succeed in the time of connections and crowdsourcing, you need to know how new power functions. You’ll need new tools to influence people, new systems to build crowds and new values to lead with. The following blinks shed light on all this and show you how to thrive by using some fundamental rules of power. In these blinks, you’ll find out how an epileptic woman used new power to cure herself; why spreading has replaced sticking; and why Pope Francis is an excellent new-power leader. Before the twenty-first century, society was imagined as a giant machine. People were but cogs in this machine, playing small and standardized roles. This was a golden age for colossal corporations and sprawling bureaucracies – a time when companies hoarded power as though it were currency. They made decisions for those participating in their power systems, believing they knew what was best. Such an attitude typified old power. Meanwhile, the participants in the system filled static, stereotypical roles and obeyed the system’s commands: Do your multiplication tables. Say your prayers. Buy this product. In short, chances to meaningfully participate in any role – civic, political or economic – were scarce. But times have changed. Hyperconnected technology has been a battering ram, unlocking digital doors and lowering the barriers of participating in almost any given activity. And this increase in the horizontality of power distribution is changing our behavior. For example, the logistics of organization and participation are now unconstrained by space or time. This lets, say, artists from Ireland and India collaborate together, in real time and for free. Added to that, we now have the tools to easily meet other like-minded people, lobby for change and organize resistance. And these behaviors have also altered our attitudes. We’re no longer satisfied with merely observing or agreeing; we demand a right to participate. Letitia Browne-James perfectly embodies this new attitude. A lifetime epileptic, Browne-James had all but had it with her neurologist and the ineffective medication she was prescribing. Then she stumbled across PatientsLikeMe – an online community of thousands of patients sharing experiences, recommendations and personal medical data. Through the platform, she discovered that brain surgery is an effective treatment for epilepsy. In fact, 83 percent of PatientsLikeMe users reported positive results from it. Her doctor had never discussed this option with her, so Browne-James changed physicians.   In the end, she underwent the surgery, and it’s now been five years since she’s had a seizure. By using PatientsLikeMe to take control of her health care, Browne-James used new power. So what exactly differentiates the values underlying new power from those underlying old power? Well, it’s sort of like the conflict between the worldviews of a parent and a child. The experienced, authoritative parent is always irked when their child, fresh-faced and full of idealism, attempts to influence the parenting process. By trying to change habits or question received wisdom, the child proposes new values. And the values of old power and new power clash in multiple ways. For a start, there’s a disagreement between their governing styles. Old power prefers formal and centralized governance – such as business decisions dictated from the boardroom. But new power prefers informal, networked governance – think business decisions crowdsourced among employees. Also, while old power views competitiveness as the jewel of human interaction, new power encourages cooperation and collaboration. New-power systems should reward the sharing of resources, the spreading of ideas and the remixing of original work. Their attitudes toward communication are different, too. Old power has a tendency to separate society’s public and private spheres. Here, things are on a strict need-to-know basis. Hillary Clinton illustrated this perfectly by likening politics to sausage-making: the process is unsavory – a technique the public doesn’t need to know about – but many people enjoy the end product. Clinton was trying to argue that transparent politics would be much less effective. New power rejects this view. It prefers open, transparent dealings. Items usually considered private, like a company’s salary data, are fast becoming incorporated into a right-to-know attitude. But new power isn’t only shifting value systems; it’s changing people’s roles, too. Consider the traditional “passive” consumer who is asked only to buy or use a product. This role is becoming an endangered species; its predator is the “maker” – consumers who consume and produce. Just take YouTube bloggers or citizen journalists. Thanks to accessible technologies, they’re able to create content that previously only well-funded elites could produce. And that’s not all. We’re also seeing shifts away from long-term commitment to brands toward temporary affiliation. In short, the ways people behave and associate with brands are changing. The declining number of people carrying membership cards shows this. The days of Blockbuster video store members are over. Now the new norm is drifting between online groups and using social media to temporarily associate with brands. We’re driven by impulses to opt in and later opt out. When envisaging your dream house, you probably don’t put much imaginative effort toward visualizing the foundations propping it up. Well, it’s the same with power systems; we tend to pay attention to their values, not the models they rest on. So what’s the difference between the models for old and new power? For one, new-power models cede power in a more distributed way. Consider Occupy, the protest movement fighting inequality. This is a crowd organization – a system that uses both new-power models and values. For example, it values radical transparency, equality and a meaningful role for all participants. But it also uses a highly distributed model for sharing power, opposing institutionalization and promoting local decision-making in subgroups. But this can raise issues. For instance, with Occupy’s distributed power-sharing model, it’s tough to reach any consensus or implement major organizational changes. In contrast, old-power models are built like a pyramid. A surprising example of this model is Apple. Apple is a typical castle – an organization holding old-power models and values. Yes, it’s a cutting-edge technology company, but the way it centralizes power and dictates decisions means it uses an old-power model. What’s more, Apple is notoriously secretive and dislikes brand collaborations, which aligns it with classic old-power values. But it’s not necessary to choose one power system or the other. Indeed, organizations often blend approaches, combining the models and values of both new and old power. Companies that mix old-power models with new-power values are called cheerleaders. The outdoor clothing brand Patagonia is one such company. It produces products with little external input, which is an old-power model, but collaborates with consumers by asking them to join the company in the fight against climate change and is very transparent about things like its supply chain. On the other hand, organizations that adopt old-power values and new-power models are co-opters. Facebook is a prime example. The company has built a social network based on a radical new-power model, featuring peer-to-peer networking and an interconnected infrastructure, but that doesn’t mean it holds new-power values. In fact, Facebook’s relationship with its users is very one-sided. It prevents them from suggesting or implementing major changes to the ecosystem and stockpiles your personal data like an old king hoarding treasure. How do you communicate with your target audience? It’s a question as old as business itself. Influencers and advertisers seek techniques to implant their ideas into people’s heads, but for years influencer techniques went unchanged. That’s partly because before digital communication, our main cultural influences were largely shared. Before niche online communities or specialized media, there were a few newspapers to read and/or TV channels to watch. Huge audiences were funneled into this handful of outlets, forcing advertisers to craft messages with wide appeal. In this environment, potent messages were sticky and memorable sound bites, like Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan. And to design sticky messages, the SUCCESS acronym showed the way. This was introduced by Chip and Dan Heath in their best seller Made to Stick. Here, they argued that truly sticky ideas exhibited SUCCES (altered to SUCCESS for stickiness!) – simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. For example, sticky ideas should tell a story, taking us on a journey of sorts. But they must also be concrete, creating within us a clear mental picture. What’s more, sticky ideas should be credible, incorporating impressive statistics and expert opinions. But the goal isn’t just to make things stick anymore. New power makes ideas spread by adding ACE – which stands for actionable, connection and extensible – to SUCCESS. To spread, ideas need to be actionable. This links back to declining passive consumption. People want to be able to participate. Facebook’s “share” button is so effective because of this actionable quality. Second, spreading relies on the power of connection. To disperse properly, ideas should harness our era’s powerful online networking tools. With the help of connectivity, ideas will spread like a ripple on a lake. Finally, ideas that spread are extensible. This means they harness the creative power of a community, allowing participants to alter and remix the idea while keeping its underlying structure. Extensibility is the magic behind the spreading of memes. Maybe you remember the Ice Bucket Challenge? It was an online sensation dedicated to fundraising for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and it leveraged ACE expertly. Basically, challenge participants would drench themselves in a bucket of icy water before posting a video of it online, calling out their friends to also “take up the challenge.” The Ice Bucket Challenge was actionable because it required you to actually dump the bucket of icy water on yourself. It was connected because it utilized the social networks of participants. And it was extensible because it encouraged remixing. For example, the baseball player Pete Frates posted his challenge with Vanilla Ice’s “Ice Ice Baby” playing in the background. What use is new power if it’s hoarded by corporations like Facebook, Uber and Airbnb? Well, the truth is new power can’t be hoarded. Anyone can harness the potential of new power for their own ends, but first you need to build a crowd. This involves five steps: find, build, lower, move and harness. First, find your connected connectors: the influential, highly connected individuals who share your organization’s visions and values. Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign is a striking example of finding and nurturing connected connectors. These connectors were a mixed group of online activists who, through content creation and connection via online message boards, built a passionate base of online support for Trump. Next, you need to build a brand that embodies new power. Just take Airbnb. In 2014, the company, though riding high, was losing its sense of intimacy and beginning to look like any other faceless corporation. To tackle this, Airbnb relaunched its brand with a revamped logo designed to be remixed. Hosts could even edit Airbnb’s logo on their personal profile, adapting it to suit their style and needs. The next two steps – lower and move – are kind of like electric guitars and amplifiers. Neither are very effective alone. To start, in our world of shortening attention spans, it’s essential to lower the barriers of participation. Users demand frictionless, pain-free participation. The dating app Tinder shows how these barriers can be lowered in any scenario: the days of working up the courage to ask your crush out for dinner are over – now, you can arrange a date with just a few swipes of your thumb! Once users are participating, you need to move them up the participation scale. Think of this as a spectrum of consumer engagement. At the bottom are old-power actions, like complying or consuming. Moving up the scale, consumers become more involved – sharing, affiliating or remixing content. Finally, at the very top, we find activities only a small number will participate in: funding, producing and shaping the whole community. Often a crowd will increase incrementally, and your efforts at crowd-building will progress slowly but steadily. But this isn’t always the case. Sometimes a crowd will form in a “storm” of engagement, and you need to be ready to harness the changing weather.    Consider the Australian activist network GetUp. They created an engagement storm when Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister who opposed refugee rights, offered surfing lessons at a charity auction. GetUp hijacked the auction, successfully crowdfunding a winning bid for Riz Wakil, a young Afghan refugee. This creative prank caused a swarm of engagement inside GetUp’s community. They say the world is built on compromise. A situation agreeable to you is often disagreeable to others, and today’s critical business moments usually hinge on your ability to juggle the desires of essential stakeholders. In a new-power community, there are three stakeholders, all in a triangular-shaped dynamic. Topping the triangle are the platform owners. They own the infrastructure – like IP addresses and servers – and set the overarching rules. If we take Facebook, we find that Mark Zuckerberg and his company, Facebook, Inc., are the platform owners. It’s easy to think that platform owners are the community’s most important actors. But what would Facebook look like without its billions of users? These users form the second corner of our triangle. They’re the normal users, or participants, taking part in the new-power organization and contributing most to its economic value. The participants in the popular content aggregator Reddit are the users who read and vote on new content. Super-participants are just what they sound like: participants playing extremely active roles in the community. Think back to the participation scale. You’ll find super-participants nested happily in the upper echelons of this spectrum – funding, organizing and producing new content for the platform to give it unique cultural value. YouTube is particularly famous for its super-participants. Because the platform’s barrier for participation is low, it’s easy for regular participants to become super-participants through their effort and talent. Just take the Mexican beauty vlogger Yuya: At just sixteen she’d already won a YouTube-sponsored makeup contest, which inspired her to create her own channel, lady16makeup. Today, it’s the 35th most subscribed YouTube channel in the world! So, we know the key actors of a new-power community – but why the triangle? Well, it’s crucial for a new-power community to balance each key actor’s interests, and these can often fall into conflict. YouTube’s Partner Program is a shining example of a platform that nurtures its super-participants. It supports its content creators by sharing 55 percent of their video’s advertising revenue. It’s a win-win for YouTube, satisfying super-participants and incentivizing great new content. If a platform is trying to engage its participants more, a great way of showing they’re valued is introducing a recognition system where they are rated on their contributions. Examples like Reddit’s “karma” system or eBay’s “power-seller” program make users feel validated and respected. Like the sun, the key actor triangle doesn’t float aimlessly in a vacuum devoid of context or environment. Instead, it’s orbited by a host of secondary actors, influencing the triangle’s dynamic and the organization’s fate in general. This means that maintaining a well-balanced triangle isn’t enough to create a successful new-power community. You must also cultivate a small ensemble of other players and partners. These include institutional funders, the media, NGOs, celebrities or influencers and the general public. Consider Invisible Children, the humanitarian organization behind the video Kony 2012. A YouTube sensation pushing for the capture of Joseph Kony, the Ugandan warlord, Kony 2012 was dubbed “the most viral video in the world.” But the response to the video was mostly negative. Invisible Children was criticized for uneducated activism. Its website crashed and critics questioned its financial structure. Before this, the organization had a perfectly aligned triangle. It cultivated super-participants with training programs, decentralized power to local organizers and supported the participants sharing its content. Unfortunately, Kony 2012 bypassed this model to seek rapid international fame. In particular, Invisible Children failed to cultivate outside influencers orbiting its triangle, like celebrities and academic critics. This lapse turned into a black hole, which swallowed up Invisible Children’s reputation. So, how do new-power organizations balance their triangle and keep a steady orbit? Through the participation premium. Think about old-power models based on basic economic transactions – things like purchasing a camera. Today, to be truly successful, organizations need to provide users with both a product or service and a higher purpose. Combining these elements gives us the participation premium. This can be seen in a range of different contexts. Consider the “IKEA effect,” a term coined by the behavioral economists Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely. It’s the idea that people participating in a project, or contributing toward a goal, place a higher value on the finished product than its objective worth. This effect is so named because the researchers observed subjects overvaluing furniture they assembled themselves. The Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi is a company known for its high participation premium. Every single week the manufacturers launch a new version of their user interface, asking users to review it. In turn, customers feel as though they’re a valuable part of the development process and therefore contributing to a higher purpose. Old power and new power are colliding in our current world. The leaders that stand out are embracing old techniques, but harnessing three new leadership tools: signaling, structuring and shaping. Pope Francis, for instance, is a startling new-power leader. He uses his unorthodox actions – like washing a refugee’s feet – to demonstrate personal values to subordinates within his ultratraditional organization. These actions signal desirable behaviors to adherents. Pope Francis is also an example of leadership by structuring. He has tried – say, through his reforms to the Vatican Bank – to use his leadership as a restructuring process. By decentralizing power, he is revamping the church’s power dynamic and flipping the old-power pyramid, where power flows from the top down, into an inverted pyramid, where power flows from the bottom up. Also, look no further than the pope for examples of shaping. Shaping is a way of influencing the general direction of an organization, subtly molding the beliefs and attitudes of your followers and subconsciously changing the rules of the game. Pope Francis famously encapsulated the shaping leadership style when, during a flight from Brazil, a journalist asked him for his views on homosexuality. His simple reply? “Who am I to judge?” The key difference between shaping and structuring is that the former is a subtle but active process of reform, while the latter is a passive “lead by example”-tactic. But old-power leadership is far from dead – and blending both leadership styles may be the key to succeeding in this transitory time. Consider Podemos, Spain’s progressive political party. Dissatisfied with the domestic political climate, founder Pablo Iglesias launched the party, surprisingly enough, with an old-power tactic: a TV show. This might seem an odd choice, but Iglesias was using the show to get plenty of airtime from traditional news outlets, from which he gained a large following for his charismatic speaking skills. Initially, the focus was on his charming personality and not his new political movement, seemingly like an old power “top-down” organization. But when Podemos subsequently became an official party, it was launched with a wealth of new-power values. For example, Podemos’s manifesto championed “horizontality and transparency,” even putting the existence of the whole party to a popular vote. It continued to retain the charismatic leadership of Iglesias, but the party began using revolutionary democratic methods, such as crowdsourcing its policies. Blending powerful, charismatic leaders with new-power values, Podemos is a stellar example of a hybrid new power–old power leadership model. The key message in these blinks: Digital connectivity has changed our era’s power dynamics. Old power, with its centralized top-down hierarchy, is being replaced with a bottom-up new-power system that prizes decentralization, collaboration and transparent execution. These systems have different models and values, but it’s not simply a case of “new power = good; old power = bad.” Both have merits and disadvantages. And although they can be blended, new power offers a fresh set of tools for building crowds, spreading ideas and leading organizations. Got feedback?

Every day, thousands of aircrafts take off from runways and arrive safely at their destinations and nobody worries about them. Decades of research into safety mechanisms, safeguards, and updated procedures mean that flying today is safer than it has ever been. But air travel, like many of the potentially disastrous systems that are part of our social and economic fabric, is highly complex – when something does go wrong, it goes very wrong indeed. Normal Accidents tells the story of these rare incidents and their impact. First published in 1984, the book warned against the further adoption of nuclear power. Nuclear power plants, like flight, carry risks that are often mitigated by safety precautions, but can cause unparalleled damage thanks to something as trivial as a loose screw. The author’s assertion that these accidents can and will happen despite our best efforts to contain them has been sadly vindicated by the 1986 Chernobyl and 2011 Fukushima nuclear disasters, as well as numerous major oil spills and two space shuttle tragedies. In these blinks, you will discover how these highly complex systems work, and how certain systems are more prone to terrible catastrophe than others. In addition, you will learn to assess the inherent risks of systems, and end up asking yourself whether it might not be better to simply abandon some systems altogether! After reading these blinks, you’ll find out: how two ships about to safely pass each other on the Mississippi River ended up in a non-collision course collision, how “papering over the cracks” near the Grand Teton Dam cost eleven people their live, and how three astronauts narrowly avoided suffocating to death in space. Imagine you have an important job interview. Preoccupied, you step out the door without your keys, and the door locks behind you. That’s OK – you keep a door key hidden nearby. Wait, you forgot – your friend has it, and he lives across town. So you ask your neighbor for a lift, but his car won’t start. You rush to the bus stop only to discover that there’s a bus drivers’ strike, and all the taxis are occupied. Disparaged, you cancel the interview. Sometimes it just works out that way: rare sequences of events thwart precautions, such as safety devices, workarounds and backups. For example, your hidden key was a backup, but failed because you changed your plan and gave it to a friend. The bus system wasn’t a workaround because its drivers were on strike, and the resulting lack of cabs show how dependent, or coupled, the two transport systems were to one another. None of these errors would be a problem on their own. However, when they all interact with each other unexpectedly, they cause the entire system – and in this case your job interview – to fail. System accidents, where multiple failures result in disaster, are often so complicated that we can neither foresee nor comprehend them in real time. System accidents arise from a range of errors: in Design, Equipment, Procedure, Operator, Supplies and an unpredictable Environment – or DEPOSE, for short. The door-locking mechanism and lack of emergency taxi capacity, for example, were design errors. When the neighbor’s car failed to start, it was an equipment error. Not allowing extra time for delays on the way to your interview was a failure in procedure. The bus strike and the taxi shortage were failures in the environment. And finally, absent-mindedly leaving the house without your keys was an operator error. Of course, a system accident in which you miss an interview isn’t the end of the world. But what happens when one occurs at something like a nuclear or chemical plant? Why is it that some complex organizations or technologies succeed, while simpler ones fail spectacularly at the first hurdle? To answer this, we’ll need to take a look at the characteristics of systems. Systems can be categorized both by their complexity, and the flexibility of their processes. Some involve complex interactions, which are difficult or even impossible to predict. Complex systems involve interactions consisting of close, interconnected components, and thus provide only indirect or ambiguous information to system operators like pilots or power plant technicians. Linear interactions, on the other hand, are easy to predict. Here, the components are segregated, and therefore provide direct information. Systems can also be tightly coupled, so processes have invariable sequences and delays aren’t possible. They contrast with loosely coupled systems, where processes are flexible and allow for delays. A system’s specific combination of complexity and coupling will affect its functionality. Universities, for example, are complex systems. They’re massive organizations with multiple interacting components that aren’t easily predictable. However, they’re also loosely coupled. If a professor falls ill and can’t teach, substitutes can be found without the entire system grinding to a halt. Dams, on the other hand, are linear systems with tight coupling, making workarounds and recoveries less reliable. Being linear, they aren’t subject to unexpected interactions and are therefore free of system accidents. However, the fact that they are tightly coupled means that a single component failure often can’t be remedied or isolated, which then triggers failure in other components, and on rare occasions leads to catastrophe. And that’s exactly what happened in 1976, when the Grand Teton Dam in Idaho collapsed, killing eleven people and destroying $1 billion in property. Prior to the disaster, geologists had found cracks in the surrounding rocks, which they knew even a small leak could exacerbate. So they filled the cracks with cement. However, their solution couldn’t handle the high pressure in the dam, which in turn led to the leak that caused the disaster. So what do system accidents actually look like? In 1979, the core at the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant partially melted and came close to releasing massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment. In a complex and tightly coupled system like TMI, where interactions are often unpredictable yet also unable to handle delays, trivial and unrelated failures can interact to cause a system accident. At TMI, four small, separate failures caused the accident. What’s worse, they all occurred within 13 seconds of each other, so operators had no opportunity to react or even acknowledge them. The first failures occurred when water leaking from a seal caused moisture to enter the air system. A false signal told the water pumps to stop, which, as a precaution, shut down the turbine used to generate power. The second failure involved the emergency water pumps, which were inoperable due to some closed valves. As a result, the core’s temperature and pressure rose. Luckily, TMI was outfitted with safety devices. However, as in all system accidents, these are sometimes ineffective or can even damage recovery. For example, when an automatic safety device (ASD) opened to relieve the pressure, it got stuck – the third failure. The ASD signalled that it had shut, but had actually remained open – the fourth failure. Faults in the coolant system that are still not understood disguised the destabilization of the core, and led to the overheating of the coolants themselves. The operators followed safety procedures and reduced the cold water feed, but there was still a major problem: due to a lack of heat removal, the core was uncovered and a hydrogen bubble had formed. Two hours later, operators finally identified the malfunctioning ASD and closed it manually, and were then able to cool down the reactor and bring everything back under control. TMI could easily have gone the other way, and the accident offers us a valuable lesson: complexity and coupling are inherent in our riskiest industries. You often hear that it’s safer to fly than to drive a car. And truly, flying is relatively safe. Over the years, repeated flight trials and experiences with error management have all inspired better designs and safety measures, which have in turn resulted in fewer and fewer crashes per number of flights. A reduction in complexity and coupling has also greatly decreased the risks in flying. For example, today’s jet engine design is even less complex than the piston engine! Moreover, the air traffic control system has evolved to be less tightly coupled, by, for example, restricting access for different types of aircraft to different areas. As a result, there are almost no mid-air collisions. Nevertheless, despite these improvements in safety, the inherent complexity and tight coupling of flying means there will always be crashes. For example, while jetliners offer the safest mode of flying, the DC-10 (a once popular airliner produced in the 1980s) has a history of catastrophic accidents. However, rather than system accidents, most of these were component failure accidents, meaning they had a single cause that resulted in other failures. For instance, in 1979 at Chicago O’Hare, one of three engines of a DC-10 was hastily serviced before takeoff. To the horror of the passengers, that engine tore off mid-flight. While the plane could still fly with the other two engines, three resulting failures – the retraction of the left wing’s leading edge slats, loss of the slat disagreement warning system and loss of the stall warning system – caused the crew to lose control of the plane, resulting in 273 deaths. In spite of the great improvements in air traffic safety, a simple maintenance error, combined with design errors in the slats, led to hundreds of deaths. Flying, with its multitude of components, unpredictable interactions, and pressure to maintain a tight schedule, will never be risk-free. The dangers of nuclear power are well known, but the risks involved in petrochemical plants pass largely under our radar. However, they are considerable, and we should be informed. The petrochemical industry – like the nuclear business – employs transformative processes, whereby new products are created from raw materials that are often toxic or explosive. In spite of this, the chemical industry has been in business for over a hundred years and has suffered few catastrophic accidents. There have been relatively few unpreventable system accidents resulting in high casualty figures, but they do indeed occur. For example, at a chemical plant in Texas City in 1969, no one could have predicted the sequence of events that saw a leaky valve component fail and the subsequent interactions between temperatures, pressures and gases that combined to produce an enormous explosion. Surprisingly, no one was killed, although some nearby houses were damaged. However, while unpreventable system accidents have occurred, preventable accidents in petrochemical plants have resulted in many deaths. For example, in 1984, a chemical plant in Bhopal, India released lethal gas into the environment, directly resulting in the deaths of 4,000 people in nearby shanty towns, and injuring 200,000 others. But this was no system accident, but instead an accident waiting to happen. Due to financial difficulties, the company running the plant had laid off key staff (including maintenance workers), cut back on refrigeration devices and left safety devices in disrepair. In fact, prior inspections had even identified poorly trained staff and leaky valves. Worse: no alarms sounded. Authorities were not informed of the accident and even the medical officer misinformed the public and police, telling them that the gas was not dangerous. Even after decades of complication-free production, it only takes the right mix of circumstances to cause a catastrophic system accident. But how is it that system accidents occur in spite of safety precautions? Read on to find the answer! Have you ever been under so much pressure at work that, in a frantic haste to finish, you ended up making some little mistakes? Something similar happens in systems, too. System accidents usually don’t happen because of production pressures, but these pressures do increase the likelihood of small errors, which can cascade into something uncontrollable. What about the captain of a large BP oil tanker, who was told to deliver his cargo to a west Wales terminal before high tide made it impossible to unload for another five days. To accomplish this, our faithful captain calculated that he needed to steer the tanker through the Scilly Isles in the Channel, a quicker – but more dangerous – route than he would have otherwise planned. At full speed, the captain noticed that he’d overshot and tried to turn the tanker, but nothing happened! Only when it was too late did he realize he needed to switch the control of the wheel from automatic to manual. The tanker crashed. 100,000 tons of oil seeped out along the English and French coasts. As this tragic event shows, technology designed to aid in safety and navigation, such as automatic steering, can actually increase the chances of accidents. In fact, statistics showed that while it was increasingly rare for marine accidents to be caused by mechanical failures, overall accidents were actually increasing. Most of these accidents were due to an operator’s haste or poor judgement. This happened despite the adoption of collision avoidance systems, which calculate ships’ trajectories and speeds, and aid communication between vessels. Regrettably, it appears that companies use these technological advances to decrease operating expenses and demand quicker delivery in worse weather and through busy channels. Operators, in turn, take more risks to keep up. Although the Apollo 13 space mission was en route to a moon landing, the ship never touched its dusty surface. Instead, the crew almost suffocated in the vacuum of space. Why? Despite the contributions of countless experts and billions of dollars in funding, there were still design flaws. For example, one of two oxygen tanks on board had never been tested in space. In fact, a trial on Earth resulted in the craft’s insulation burning up due to wiring faults. This was never fixed. In space, these wires created an electrical discharge, generating heat which blew off the cap of the oxygen tank and emptied it. Then the second tank started leaking. Nothing on board notified the crew or mission control that one of the tanks had exploded. Even if it had, the warning lights themselves were misleading. Moreover, the astronauts were only trained for failures of one or two components, and even then relied on safety devices and backups. Only when one of the astronauts looked out the window and saw gas escaping from the tanks did they realize that there was a problem. Despite all this, they recovered. How? By simplifying and loosening the system. All three astronauts squeezed into the tiny landing module, which had been designed for two astronauts to travel the short distance to the moon from orbit. Water and power had to be carefully rationed. Things had to get simpler: there would be no moon landing. They conserved fuel by using the gravitational force of the moon’s orbit to sling-shot the craft back to Earth. Automated devices were discarded, and the astronauts took control of the craft. They even simplified the operating procedures for re-entry on the spot. This simplification gave them extra time, and meant the system’s coupling became looser and less prone to total collapse. Thankfully, they escaped what could have been certain death; their improvised “life raft” landed in the ocean and the astronauts were saved. One day on the Mississippi River, two ships, the Pisces and the Trade Master, were on course to safely pass one another. Yet, at the last minute, they turned into each other’s paths and collided. How on Earth did this happen? Partly it’s a matter of intuition. Since we cannot pore over all possible outcomes when making a decision, we base our judgements on hunches and rules of thumb, and while these intuitions are convenient, they’re also sometimes flat-out wrong. In fact, some of our intuitions directly contradict what we know to be true. For example, if a coin has come up heads 20 times in a row, we intuit that it is far more likely to be tails next, ignoring the basic statistical properties of a coin flip: at each flip, the chance for tails is always 50 percent. In fact, even highly experienced operators can construct an understanding of the world that is totally divorced from reality. That’s where the bizarre accidents called non-collision course collisions come in. Back to our ships on the Mississippi: the captains agreed over the radio to pass starboard to starboard. Before they reached one another, however, the Pisces thought that a tug boat was overtaking, and, believing that her current trajectory would lead to a collision between the tug and the Trade Master, turned sharply toward the shore and radioed the Trade Master to request a port-to-port side pass. The Trade Master saw the maneuver, but did not hear the signal. She assumed the maneuver was a mistake that the Pisces would correct. When that didn’t happen, the Trade Master also turned to the shore sharply, hoping to avoid the tug that was supposedly behind the Pisces, and push into the soft bank of the river. All of these assumptions and intuitions about the other ship’s behavior caused their paths to intersect, and they collided, causing millions of dollars of damage. As we have seen, certain systems contain amazing risks. These final blinks will show you how to assess that risk, and what to do with that information. Do you know anyone who smokes cigarettes and at the same time condemns nuclear power? Though it might sound strange, such contradictions are natural, as we tend to minimize some dangers and maximize others. For example, risk assessors, engineers and economists tend to employ precise and quantitative goals, facilitated by mathematical models. This absolute rationality ignores the social or cultural aspects of risk and safety. Some have even quantified the value of a human life: $300,000. These rationalists don’t see a difference between deaths that occur under different circumstances. To them, the 100,000 annual traffic-accident deaths are no different to the same number of deaths from a single catastrophe. Everything is just a statistic. This kind of thinking isn’t merely bizarre, it also has broader social implications. Consider, for example, that the entire fuel cycle of coal, from mining to production, kills about 10,000 people per year, while nuclear power kills very few in comparison. An absolute rationalist would favor – and perhaps even advocate – nuclear power. In contrast, most lay people have a misunderstanding of risk and safety, skewed by memories of catastrophes and fear of the future. Since the public doesn’t possess the expert knowledge necessary to understand the technical reports of regulators, they instead place an emphasis on community spirit and family values. As a result, they are more concerned with uncertainties about new technologies and their impact on their children, also called dread risk. For example, studies have shown that the public believes that nuclear power is riskier than hazards like cars, guns and alcohol. Experts in various fields, however, rated nuclear power as comparatively less risky. Further questions revealed that the public focuses on rare disasters, rather than historical records, when assessing the risk of fatality. However, more dangerous yet more familiar activities, such as driving, were given relatively low risk ratings. If we know that system accidents can be terribly disastrous, what can we do to balance their risks against the benefits that those systems bring to our societies? One way to ease the risk of system accident is to centralize or decentralize the system, depending on its complexity and coupling. As we’ve seen, linear systems with tight coupling, such as dams and marine transport, should be centralized. Here, failures occur in expected ways and require an immediate, precise response prescribed in advance by a central authority. Complex systems with loose coupling, such as universities, should be decentralized. Here, failures may arise unexpectedly, but operators have the time to diagnose and analyze these unexpected situations. Complex interactive and tightly coupled systems, like nuclear and chemical plants, aircraft, space missions and nuclear weapons, however, require both centralization and decentralization: centralization for an urgent, disciplined response, and decentralization to allow for a thorough search for the cause of the unexpected interactions. Unfortunately, there’s no easy, cost-effective and safe way to do this. Furthermore, depending on their complexity and coupling, certain technologies should be improved, restricted or abandoned altogether. One way to figure out which solution is appropriate is to assess a technology’s catastrophic potential, referring to its capacity to affect both innocent bystanders and future generations, rather than those who knowingly take on the risk, like system operators or passengers on a plane. For this reason, technologies with low to medium catastrophic potential – i.e., generally causing deaths only to operators, suppliers or users of the system – such as space missions, dams, chemical production or flying, continue to be used, although we must take steps to improve their safety. Those with substantial catastrophic potential but a lack of viable alternatives, such as marine oil transport, should be restricted in order to avoid their worst possible outcomes. Finally, we should abandon nuclear power and nuclear weapons. These pose the greatest danger to both innocent bystanders, and, potentially, the future of humans on Earth. The key message in this book: Systems come in all shapes and sizes, and some are more at risk of major shutdowns and catastrophes than others. In fact, some are so complex and intricate that there is literally no way to stop a disaster once it has begun. To manage this, we need to decide which systems are worth keeping, and which should be abandoned altogether.

Indeed, science fiction novels and movies are filled with various sentient machines, and not all of them have humanity’s best interests at heart. But what kind of intelligent machines can we really expect in the future, and how will they be made possible? And, most importantly of all, what does this mean for humanity? In these blinks, you’ll discover why World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov isn’t dumber than a machine just because he was beaten by one. You’ll also come to understand the neurology behind predicting the future, for example, how you know that turning your car key will result in your engine starting. Finally, you’ll find out why intelligent machines won’t ever overthrow or exterminate humanity. In the past decades, computers have become ever smaller and more powerful. This development has inspired some researchers to dream of a computer powerful enough to actually think like a human being. However, despite the fact that modern computers have much more raw processing power than the human brain, they are still nowhere near intelligent, i.e., capable of being creative and understanding, and of learning from the world around them. That’s because computers and our brains are built on fundamentally different principles. Computers are programmed to do certain tasks, and that’s the extent of their abilities. They never learn anything new, but rather just store information without the ability of using it later to understand new incoming information. The brain, on the other hand, is not limited to pre-programmed tasks, but can understand and learn new things. That’s what makes it intelligent. For example, one famous computer, Deep Blue, beat Garry Kasparov, the world’s best chess player, at his own game. But Deep Blue didn’t win because it was more intelligent than Kasparov. An expert chess player like Kasparov can look at the board in any situation and instantly judge what moves make sense for his strategy and what kind of counter-response will follow. A computer, however, can only run the numbers of every single possible move and countermove, calculating the probabilities to victory. It does not understand chess any more than a pocket calculator understands the rules of math, despite its capacity for adding up numbers. In this sense, making processors more powerful or adding more memory capacity won’t necessarily help make computers intelligent. Rather, it will only make them faster at calculating – a task computers already perform better than humans. Nevertheless, computers still won’t be able to understand the world and think about the information they store the way humans do. It thus seems that the first step in building a truly intelligent machine will be understanding the workings of the human brain. Have you ever wondered why you’re capable of perceiving the world around you? Or how the sights and sounds and tastes that you sense are turned into the fluid experience of your surroundings? This is, in fact, the result of a complicated process taking place in your brain, where the sensory information that comes in is combined with your existing memories. The part of the brain responsible for sensory perception and conscious thought is known as the neocortex. When our senses tell us something, it is the neocortex that combines the incoming information with our previous memories. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Say, for example, you see a familiar face, and your eyes send this information to the brain. The lower layers of the neocortex pass this visual information on, and a higher layer connects what you see with your memory of what human faces look like. Augmented in this way, the information is passed on to a yet higher layer that then recognizes what you see as the face of, for example, your spouse or boss. Your neocortex is so fast and efficient at complementing sensory information with prior knowledge that we are not consciously aware of it. This allows us to experience the world as fluidly and seamlessly as we do. Of course, if you see something totally new, none of the neocortex’s layers can connect it to previous memories. This means the information goes right up to the top layer, which stores the experience as a new memory for future reference. And so, our brains have an ever-growing database of things to compare new experiences to. When you turn the key in the ignition of your car, what do you think will happen? Well, that’s a no-brainer – the engine starts up. But how did you know that? What makes us capable of predicting future events? Basically, it’s due to the way memories are connected in our brain, which consists of many regions, each of which stores different kinds of memories. When you experience something familiar, all the memories in the various regions relating to the experience become active in a sequence, like a pattern. For example, when we listen to music, one region of the brain tells us that we’re hearing notes because it recognizes notes based on a former memory. Another region tells us what words we hear and yet another realizes that the words and notes are connected, forming sequences. When all this information is combined, our brain knows that we’re listening to a song. These patterns allow us to predict future events, because whenever we experience something, our brain looks for similar prior experiences. The nerve cells that were activated by the previous experiences become active again, as do those that became active shortly afterward. Thus, the brain not only knows how it reacted the last time, but also what its following reactions were, all of which serves as a basis for guessing what will happen this time around. For example, when we see a traffic light turn green, we know that on previous occasions this was followed by cars beginning to move. We don’t know for sure if the same will happen again, but based on past experience, our brain makes that prediction. So, while we cannot actually see into the future, our brain is able to make predictions. In fact, every new experience the brain encounters helps it adapt those predictions. It’s in a constant learning process. In the next blinks, we’ll find out how this understanding of the brain can be used to make truly intelligent computers. Scientists know now that they can’t create truly intelligent machines by building traditional computers – the so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Once they realized this, they started to explore another option: developing neural networks, i.e., machines based on the model of the human brain, where information travels along pathways of artificial neurons. Unlike in a computer, there is no central storage unit in a brain: memory and knowledge are stored throughout the brain as a vast network of neurons. This is the architecture neural networks seek to emulate. As an example of how this works, say you input the letter “a” followed by the letter “n” into a neuron in a neural network. That neuron is connected to many others, and the input causes it to send signals to some other neurons. This starts a pulse-like wave that goes through the entire network of neurons, as each neuron sends signals onward selectively. The strength of each signal varies, depending on how sensitive each neuron is to the combination of “a” and “n,” with the most sensitive ones triggering the strongest signals, which eventually wind up as output from the network. And which neurons are most sensitive to “a” and “n”? Probably the ones related to the word “an,” so the output would be this word. As of today, though, these artificial neural networks are still too simple to mimic the sophistication of the human brain. For example, one limitation is that information can only flow in one direction in neural networks. In the brain, by contrast, there are also feedback loops through which the higher, more sophisticated regions of the brain can affect the flow of signals. That’s what allows us to, for example, think hard about where we’ve seen something before and then remember it. Another limitation is that neural networks can’t build up a memory bank, so they don’t know what inputs they have received before. This means they can’t actually learn things and use them later. Next, we’ll find out how scientists are trying to improve neural networks to build truly intelligent machines. So how far away are we from designing intelligent machines? To be honest, pretty far – but not quite as far as you might think! The first obstacle to overcome is providing the machines with at least the same memory capacity as the human brain. In order to simulate the brain’s synapses, the machine would require roughly eight trillion bytes of memory. A computer today has around 100 billion bytes, so this would need to be increased eightyfold. Unlike some years ago, this seems like a feasible target today. Such computers can, in fact, be built in labs already, but researchers also face another challenge: the machines must be small enough to be of practical use. This, too, seems feasible today thanks to silicon chips, which are small, robust and consume very little power. In fact, in the not-too-distant future, there will probably be silicon chips that far exceed the memory of the human brain. However, there is yet another obstacle: nerve cells in the brain are connected to thousands of other cells, and to truly emulate the human brain, the memory of the artificial intelligence must be similarly connected. This is a tough problem to solve and, currently, scientists do not know how the bytes in a silicon chip could be connected in this way. One potential solution is on the horizon: single fiber optic cables. These are cables that can transmit huge amounts of data very quickly, developed by telecommunications companies to be able transmit over a million concurrent conversations over a single cable. If scientists keep working on this technology, the dream of building intelligent machines seems realizable after all, as there is promise of overcoming each technological challenge. Anyone familiar with science fiction novels or movies probably knows this scenario: machines attain self-awareness and turn against humanity. Happily, such horrors can only exist in fiction, and the intelligent machines of the future have little in common with such imaginary killer robots. In fact, the worry that intelligent machines might feel their “slave” status under humans is unfair and so revolt in order to exterminate humanity is based on a false analogy. Since their intelligence would be based on the brain’s neocortex, intelligent machines will not automatically become capable of emotions and feelings. Human emotions, such as fear, desire, love and hate, aren’t generated there, but in an older, more primitive part of the brain. As long as the latter part of the brain is not emulated by the machines, they will not be human-like in this respect, but useful, unemotional tools. Instead of hurting humanity, intelligent machines will provide countless benefits, many of them not even imaginable yet. An intelligent machine could have a memory far exceeding that of the human brain, and since it would never die, it would eventually accumulate more knowledge than any individual human. This would enable it to generate ideas mere mortals would never think of. For example, intelligent machines could fundamentally change the way weather is predicted. Using weather sensors across the globe, an intelligent machine could collect global data and gain a fantastically detailed understanding of weather patterns. This is impossible for humans due to the complexity of weather systems, but the machine could “understand” weather as we understand language, and could then spot patterns hidden to us humans. It seems clear that once intelligent machines are created, they will quickly surpass humans in the ability to think and process knowledge. But it’s nothing to be afraid of, as it will provide an unimaginable wealth of benefits to mankind. The key message in this book: Thus far, computers are nowhere near as intelligent as humans: they can’t emulate the way we think, learn or use past knowledge to predict future events. To be able to do so, they would need to be built in the form of a neural network, similar to the human neocortex. Happily, the technological obstacles to doing so are being overcome. What questions were answered in this book? Why have we not been able to build intelligent machines so far? The human brain is a incredibly complex network of neurons which cannot be emulated by traditional computers, which are not capable of understanding the world around them or learning new things. How can our brains predict future events based on our past experiences? All the sensory information your brain receives activates memories throughout the various regions of the brain in a sequence. When you encounter similar sensory information again, your brain recognizes the pattern and remembers what areas were activated the previous times it encountered this pattern, thus it can guess what will happen next. Can and should we build intelligent machines? The technological obstacles needed to build neural networks that would emulate to workings of the human neocortex can potentially be overcome in the near future. Such a development would pose no threat to humanity, but would rather bring untold benefits.  Actionable advice: Thought experiment. Here’s a little thought experiment: imagine every computer in your home were several times more intelligent than you. How would you use their abilities? What kind of tasks would you have them perform? How would you spend your days? The brain is a very special organ, so don’t do anything that might damage it. It has taken millions of years of evolution for it to become as complex and sophisticated as it is, and you should never forget this. Some people seem to, damaging their brains by, for instance, taking drugs and drinking to excess. This is a tremendous waste of such a sophisticated organ; you should strive to keep your beautiful brain functioning at its highest capacity.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

If this were true, you’d probably never leave the house again. Yet all these fears over a permanent surveillance state are wrong, just as British author George Orwell was wrong in his predictions when he wrote his dystopian masterpiece, 1984. Orwell thought that technology and the power of the market would lead to an oppressive surveillance state – but in reality, they’ve led to the complete opposite. These blinks will show you why this is the case, and will calm your fears that your freedom or prosperity is being stolen away! In these blinks, you’ll learn why machines are your friend, and not your enemy; why freedom of choice is more worthwhile than freedom of equality; and why Orwell himself was a master of doublespeak. Big Brother is watching you. You’ve no doubt heard people use this phrase, but perhaps have wondered where it came from. The specter of a future surveillance state, coldly crushing human liberties, was the brainchild of British author and journalist George Orwell and described in his novel, 1984. Orwell believed that the development of technology would be used as a tool to strengthen totalitarian regimes. In his novel, Orwell imagined a mechanical device called the telescreen. A telescreen acts as both a television and a camera, allowing a government to feed propaganda to its citizens while keeping them under constant surveillance. Orwell clearly wasn’t a fan of modern technology. He worried that the advent of advanced machines represented the end of personal freedoms, if not actually the end of humanity. He felt that if machines became too advanced, we’d rely on technology too much, and essentially human intellect would erode. We would become less human, surrendering our thinking and spending all our time simply eating and sleeping. Yet in reality, Orwell’s fears were unfounded for one simple reason – machines require humans to operate them. It’s true that a machine will never be able to fully replace a person. In intelligence gathering, for instance, it’s the people on the ground who actually talk to suspects and apprehend wanted individuals, not machines crunching numbers in some far-off compound. A machine can’t build a trusting relationship, or draw out a confession or a confidence, for example. And technology doesn’t automatically lead to totalitarianism, either. Consider the many encrypted or back-channel modes of communication online, methods that allow for the unfettered expression of ideas. Such technology doesn’t destroy freedom of thought, it instead encourages it! Machines too aren’t indestructible. A network can always fail, which means that constant, unlimited surveillance simply isn’t something that is possible. When Orwell published his novel in 1949, post-war society was split into two economic camps, the capitalists in the West and the socialists in Soviet Russia. Orwell, for his part, sympathized with socialist thinking. He believed that a capitalist economy was unfair; if an owner earned £50,000 a year while his worker took in a mere 15 shillings per week, that was robbery, pure and simple. Orwell also felt that a market economy was robbing society of artistic expression and truly free thought. Artists and writers had – if they wanted to make a living – to only think, write and produce things that could sell. Similarly, Orwell believed capitalism could actually stifle invention by disincentivizing the pursuit of ideas and projects that weren’t immediately profitable. The market then, like a machine, is characterized as undermining a person’s freedom of thought. But Orwell’s ideas were wrong. Although a free market may lead to financial inequality, inequality is a fixed aspect of human life. We’re born with unequal talents – some people run faster than others, others are more clever. We all have certain characteristics that make us stronger or weaker than others. The free market can’t change that, but it can offer freedom – the freedom to purchase what we like and the freedom to succeed or fail on our own terms. And while that may lead to inequalities of wealth, it preserves something far more important: the equality of opportunity. A free market also promotes invention by offering opportunities for fulfilling everyone’s desires. A stamp collector can buy and collect stamps; a chef can buy groceries; an engineer can purchase broken bits of old technology. In other words, with the freedom to buy anything, creativity is encouraged, not diminished. Humans are social animals. More often than not, we enjoy sharing ideas and working with others. And even though Orwell was against capitalist systems and the advancement of technology, he couldn’t deny this basic fact. Yet what he didn’t realize was that technology in a free market facilitates collaboration on a tremendous scale. Through digital communication, we are able to see how people live and think all around the world, and instantaneously. With this perspective, we are often compelled to improve our own situation. Additionally, digital communication boosts collaboration by allowing us to forge bonds with others, sharing ideas and goods. Today it’s not so far-fetched to see a German shipping company teaming up with a British publisher and an Indian printing press, with each business benefiting from lower costs.   In this way, freedom of choice is inherent to digital communication, as each individual is able to choose with whom she collaborates. But this freedom of choice is also about having control over what we show others and what we see or hear. For instance, you don’t have to have an account on Facebook, or to post photos on Instagram. You don’t have to read blogs. Each person is free to share what she wants or connect with whomever, and whenever. Freedom of choice of course also includes the freedom to make bad choices – which, granted, is better than not having freedom at all. Thus, even if our internet era has to a certain extent degraded our collective tastes (social media-driven celebrity culture as just one example), it’s better to have bad taste than to live within an oppressive regime that imposes one taste for everyone, good or bad. Orwell’s Revenge was written using software that analyzed and repurposed Orwell’s language to put forth a critique of his ideas. But why didn’t the author just write a straightforward rebuttal? There was a method to this madness! Orwell had brilliant insight, understanding not only the risks of totalitarian regimes but also linking oligarchies and technology long before anyone else had made similar connections. And yet he made a huge mistake, misjudging markets and technology. As we’ve seen, the combination of these two powerful forces would have been a lifesaver in the totalitarian nightmare of 1984. However, Orwell may have actually realized his mistake, being versed in doublethink. (In 1984, doublethink refers to the ability to simultaneously think and hold two contradictory beliefs.) For instance, Orwell admired American liberty as a philosophy espoused by Thomas Jefferson, but he detested it in practice, especially when considering the rise of large-scale industry, the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor and embezzling millionaires. While Orwell was often wrong in his conclusions, he was correct in his premises. Technology today is extraordinarily powerful, leading to unprecedented global communication. Machines aren’t just exploited by governments to spy on citizens; they also allow average people to circumvent surveillance and communicate freely with each other. It’s only fitting that the author of Orwell’s Revenge affirms 1984’s vision even as he refutes it. In other words, proving Orwell right ultimately proves him wrong – the final, triumphant act of doublethink. The key message in this book: George Orwell viewed machines and capitalism as the fundamental enemies of humanity, believing that these forces could encourage and support totalitarian regimes. But in fact, technology and the free market actually foster collaboration, protect individual liberties and support freedom of choice.  Actionable advice: The internet’s a busy city; don’t sweat nosy neighbors.  If you want some time alone, don’t live in the countryside. You’re better off in a crowded city where you can lose yourself among the anonymous masses. In cities, you are free to act without others judging your behavior; everyone else is too busy to bother nosing around in your business. The same goes for the internet. With so many people online, you can browse without concern, knowing that you have just as much anonymity and privacy as you would strolling through the streets of New York City.

Unlikely. But don’t be astonished if these blinks leave you believing that Kevin Kelly is some kind of medium with psychic powers, because he managed to predict so many developments with astonishing accuracy. In these blinks, you’ll find the answers to the following questions: why this book was required reading for the entire cast of The Matrix, including Keanu Reeves, why the creation of artificial intelligence should in fact scare us, why credit cards should have disappeared in the last 20 years, and how a computer program could prove that Darwin didn’t get the whole story when he described evolution through natural selection. Think back to the year 1994 – if you were alive then. Remember how back then the internet had not yet really caught on, and there were no social networks, tablets or camera phones? Well, despite this technological “primitivity” scientists and technologists back then were already asking the same questions raised today about the future of technology. One such key question is: How can we drive technological progress by learning lessons from nature? As an example, consider artificial intelligence. At the moment, computers and machines can only perform the tasks they are programmed to do: they only exhibit clockwork logic. For instance, if you program a machine to build a car door, it can repeat this task over and over again, but it can’t do anything else without being reprogrammed. But in nature, we find far more complex “technology.” Take the human brain, for example. It can think, learn and evolve thanks to the experiences it gathers. This is known as vivid logic, and if we wish to improve on artificial intelligence, we need to emulate this vivid logic in machines too. Yet learning from nature is just one lane in a two-way street: we can also add elements of technology to nature. In other words, while we can learn from nature to build machines that are capable of learning, we can also enhance natural systems with the help of technology. One example of this is bioengineering: breeding and modifying plants and animals in specific ways designed to benefit mankind – for example, by selectively breeding cows so that their offspring produce more milk. Going even further, we can also see the convergence of nature and technology in bionic vivisystems: networks of individuals and machines in which the network itself is a living entity. One natural example of a vivisystem in nature is a beehive, which is capable of learning, adapting and surviving, but is not an individual organism in itself. One common trait in current technologies and machines is that they all demand intense control and supervision by humans. But as we begin to merge the artificial and the biological, we will come to find that we humans must begin to relinquish our control. Why? As nature and technology merge, nature will be the dominant partner. This is because firstly, nature is the foundation of all life on earth, so inevitably it is technology that must adapt to nature, not the other way around. What’s more, natural processes tend to be more efficient than artificial ones. For example, nature is the ultimate recycler: the nutrients stored in dead plants and animals are reused by the ecosystem far more efficiently than by any artificial system. In order to take advantage of similarly efficient natural processes, we must be willing to relinquish our control. Instead of acting as iron-fisted managers, we must instead consider ourselves shepherds who do better by guiding the flock as a whole in a general direction rather than trying to control every single individual sheep. Such an approach would also allow artificial systems to develop according to three natural principles: autonomy, creativity and adaptability. Autonomy: machines react independently to situations and make their own decisions;     Creativity: machines invent better ways to perform tasks and even think of new areas in which to apply their skills; Adaptability: machines learn and evolve as the circumstances and the environment change. One of humanity’s main challenges for the 21st century will be to relinquish control over artificial systems so they can develop according to these natural principles. Have you ever seen a swarm of bees? If you have, you were no doubt amazed at how it moved uniformly, as if it were a single organism and of a single mind. In fact, we humans can learn a lot from swarm systems: they already exhibit many of characteristics we hope to attain by merging nature and technology. For example, swarm systems lack a centralized hierarchical command. Instead, all the subunits in the system are autonomous and exist on the same level in the command hierarchy. In a bee swarm, every bee is autonomous, and there is no single “leader bee” that makes decisions. Instead, all decisions are made collectively. What’s more, swarm systems are highly adaptable and resilient when subunits are lost. Even if several individual bees die, this only affects part of the swarm, while the whole survives. So how can we apply these beneficial traits to technology? By building networks. A network is like an artificial version of a bee swarm; it consists of various subunits known as nodes, each of which is connected to every other node in the network. Let's say we have a network like this for communicating information from one node to another. The network would be highly stable: even if individual nodes malfunctioned, the information could still find alternative paths to travel. This is why the internet, for example, cannot be totally knocked out – only individual sites or parts of the net can be taken down. Growing a network like this is easy, as more nodes can simply be added without any fundamental change to the network itself. What’s more, each added node exponentially increases the number of connections for information to travel along, and thereby the robustness of the network. For example, try drawing a network comprising three nodes. As you can see, it has three connections. Now try adding one more node. You should now suddenly have not four, but six connections! Imagine a world where there are no big corporations or organizations, but instead everyone runs their own one-person company. Sound crazy? Well, if network thinking were applied to the economy, that’s what the result would look like: a network economy. Today, if you want to buy a chair, typically a single company would control every stage of the production and delivery process, from designing the chair to shipping it to your home. In a network economy though, each individual stage would be handled by a specific node. For example, you (node 1) would identify a general production manager (node 2) who would contact a designer (node 3). The designer would in turn send the designs to a carpenter (node 4) who would build the chair and contact a logistics expert (node 5) who would ship the finished product to you. This process might well be unique: once the chair has been shipped, this exact same combination of nodes might never be used again, and all the later chairs created will probably take a different path through the network. So what are the benefits of this kind of network economy over a traditional one? First, a network economy would be more ecological. This is because goods are only produced when a consumer in the network demands it, so there is no excess production. What’s more, network economies encourage recycling, because when one person is done with something, they can pass it forward in the network for someone else to use or break down into raw materials. Another benefit is that consumers have more power. This is because producers must respond to specific consumer demands: “I want a blue, wooden chair with five legs.” Also, consumers themselves can be part of the production network, as in the case of crowd-sourced software such as the web browser Firefox. As you have seen, network thinking can provide many benefits. But networks also raise some concerns for their members. Foremost is privacy. Concern for privacy arises from the fact that being part of a network would require individuals to share a lot of information with others so that the network can function efficiently. But of course no individual would want all their information to be released to just anybody, so it is important that networks have a way to protect the privacy of individual nodes. This would require a means of deleting information about yourself from the network. But who should do this? One might think that this should be left to the private sector to avoid centralized government control, but this would also be a mistake – if private companies had the power to erase data from the network, there would be nothing to stop them from selling this service to criminals. Hence encryption is a better tool than selective deletion – rendering information into a form that only authorized people can decode. One example of an advanced application of encryption is electronic cash. You may think that this is what credit cards are, but true electronic cash is anonymous, like regular cash, only it can be transferred to merchants as effortlessly as payments from a credit card. Merchants will no longer be able to see your purchasing history and personal information every time you use credit cards. For electronic cash to work, it requires strong encryption that makes it impossible for the merchant to decipher who exactly was the payer in any given transaction, unless the payer authorizes it. In the 1930s, a famous ecologist called Aldo Leopold set his sights on a very ambitious task: he wanted to create his own ecosystem on an old farm purchased by the University of Wisconsin. Specifically, he introduced certain species into particular climatological and environmental conditions in order to create a prairie ecosystem similar to the large grasslands of the United States. Yet despite having the right climate and introducing the right plant and animal species to the farm, Leopold found that a true prairie ecosystem didn’t emerge: non-prairie plants and animals kept thriving. It turned out he had forgotten one crucial element of natural prairies: fire. In nature, wildfires periodically ravage prairies and thereby regulate them. This example demonstrates just how difficult it is to artificially design ecosystems. No matter how clever and methodical scientists try to be, natural ecosystems comprise such a complex web of factors that it’s impossible to recreate them accurately. Indeed, scientists have always failed at their efforts to do so. So how do stable ecosystems emerge if not by design to a clear goal? They simply develop over time through an evolutionary process that has a degree of randomness and uncertainty to it. Herein lies a lesson for the biotechnology of the future: complex machines must also arise from a similarly random process, where the end goal is not defined but rather emerges on its own. But for this to work, humanity must relinquish its desire to control and deliberately design biotechnology. Just as Leopold had to give nature a big say – e.g., with wildfires – in order to get his prairie ecosystem to work, so must we give chaos and randomness a big say in our biotechnology. As you know, life has evolved on earth as dictated by Darwin’s natural selection and certain conditions like the availability of oxygen, water and sunlight. This process has resulted in our human intelligence. But in fact, if you think about it, if we were to design an “evolutionary” computer program with certain rules and conditions governing it like those applied in the evolution of life, artificial intelligence could well evolve from it. So how can such a program be designed? The way the human brain works is an important inspiration: it’s a huge decentralized network made up of millions and millions of interconnected neurons, like nodes in an information network. Contrary to what our intuition says, we have no actual control over the way our brain develops and what kind of attitudes and character traits emerge in an individual. Thus, if we were to develop an artificial version of such a network, would it not work in the same way as a human brain? It would learn and develop just like a human brain, and we would have no idea whether it would become good or evil. More importantly though, once we attain this level where an artificial intelligence can be self-sustaining and self-improving, we will be very close to artificial evolution. In a sense, we will be God-like, though with one important distinction: we will have to share our universe with our creation, and the unintended consequences are unknown. The artificial evolution explained in the previous blink is a tantalizing prospect not only because it could result in artificial intelligence, but also because it could teach us a lot about how our own evolution happened. For example, when we define the right parameters for artificial evolution in a computer program, we can watch and study how natural selection works. Even better, it is also conceivable that we could alter the conditions of the program so that the evolution would be driven by a mechanism other than natural selection. After all, it was only conditions on earth that made natural selection the driving evolutionary force. In the case of artificial evolution, we can set conditions which may result in an entirely different evolutionary force emerging! The question remains, though, what higher power originally set the conditions on earth that initiated our own evolution? Whatever it was, we may as well call this higher power God. This idea is known as postdarwinism. Another way artificial evolution can teach us about natural evolution is by the fact that some aspects are shared by both processes. For example, we might observe that contrary to what Darwinists believe, genetic mutations were not random, but rather came about as responses to environmental signals. Or we might see that evolutionary developments converge on certain shared standards that last for a long time, in that same way that the auto industry has settled on the standard four-wheeled model of the automobile. Perhaps life has also landed on such norms through a process which we can observe first-hand in our artificial evolution. What do the stock market and an unknotted balloon zipping around a room erratically have in common? They both seem at first glance completely chaotic processes, but are on closer inspection somewhat predictable. To a novice investor, stock price curves seem to bounce around wildly. But as she learns about the economy, she’ll find many of the movements predictable. Similarly, if you unknot a balloon and then try to catch it as it flies around the room, you’ll at first find it a near-impossible task. But soon you’ll find yourself improving as you learn to anticipate its movements. It seems that in both cases there is some order in the apparent chaos after all. But in neither case do we actually understand the process behind the chaos. Instead, we only formulate simplified rules of thumb about what happens next. This so-called positive myopia is not totally accurate, but it helps us make short-term predictions about chaotic processes. In the long-term though, it becomes outdated. For example, in the stock market, an investor may observe that the price of oil has gone up consistently for many years, and then starts making investments based on a rule of thumb that this trend will continue. She may well reap profits for a short time, but sooner or later the price of oil will fall and she will lose money. The rule of thumb will have become obsolete. In the case of biotechnology, like the swarm systems described earlier, it is clear that they can develop in wholly unpredictable ways. And even though we can use our positive myopia to make short-term predictions, in the long-term we have no idea what will happen. In fact, historically scientists have been no better at predicting the future in the long-term than if they made random guesses. Thus we must simply accept that we can only predict the immediate future. Like it or not, our control does not extend further than that. The key message in this book: As technology advances, the natural and the artificial will intermingle and merge into networks and systems that will greatly affect the fate of society and humanity. It is crucial that humans learn to relinquish control in these developments.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Or are you done with being online all the time and dream of running away to live in some sequestered cottage?  We’ve surrounded ourselves with a world of digital information, and now these media are setting the pace for us, which can be overwhelming. After all, we’re not cyborgs yet, just creatures bound to natural rhythms. In these blinks, you’ll find out how digital media are transforming our personal lives, our culture and even our perception of time – and learn about the conflicts that arise in the process.  You’ll also discover why planning and patience are no longer our strong suits; that we all have multiple personalities nowadays; and why you can blame the remote control if your biography resembles that of Bart Simpson rather than Luke Skywalker.  Imagine you’re practicing tennis with a ball machine, when the machine suddenly starts shooting balls out faster and faster until you can’t keep up. That’s how cultural and technological change has progressed for the last few decades. Around 1970, the futurist Alvin Toffler predicted that we’d soon reach a rate of progress that was so fast we would enter a state called future shock.  In the twentieth century, we had a future-oriented view of technology. People obsessed over revolutionary inventions and business models they thought were on the way. Everyone was excited by the possibilities afforded by new technologies, like cell phones that let us talk to our friends, relatives or co-workers at any time.  The pace of change kept increasing, however. Computer processing speed doubled every two years.  That’s why Toffler predicted that we’d reach a point where we wouldn’t be able to keep up, mentally or emotionally. We’d experience future shock – a kind of culture shock that happens within your own culture. That “future” is already here. People increasingly feel lost in the modern world and we’re no longer motivated by the technological optimism of the twentieth century. Future shock has turned into present shock.  We’re surrounded by change and lack a clear sense of direction, so we’ve given up on planning for a better tomorrow. Instead, we want everything now.  This feeling manifests in many ways. Few traders look for long-term investments, for instance, preferring deals with instant benefits instead.  Just think about the investors who already had Facebook shares the first day the company went public. Many sold them the very next day because they hadn’t risen enough. Stories used to be laid out with a clear beginning, middle and end. Think of Snow White or Star Wars, for example. This is no longer the case, however. People used this classic structure because it helped them make sense of things. After all, stories are instruments of thought: they give order to the world around us.  That's why stories followed a linear structure for centuries. They started with a hero the audience could identify with, like Luke Skywalker. At first, Luke is just a regular guy living with his family.  Then something unusual happens to the hero, prompting them to go on some kind of journey. For Luke, it happens when his family gets murdered and he sets out to become a Jedi. The tension is resolved in the end when the hero wins or loses. Star Wars concludes when Luke saves the rebels and avenges his family.  People soon learned to distrust these stories, however, thanks to the politicians and advertisers who used them to manipulate us.  Consider a person who enlists in the military, for instance. They would think of themselves as a hero going off to save their country, but once they get there, they might realize the war is raging for very different reasons and they’ve been deceived. The soldier would return home skeptical or resentful toward traditional stories. So many people have had experiences like this that we now prefer a more fragmented form of storytelling.  Our technology enables this fragmentation even further. We can zip through the channels with a remote or switch to a new YouTube video whenever we like – we don’t have to stay on a continuous narrative.  Your smartphone enables you to do something your ancestors could never do: be in more than one place at a time. That’s great in some ways, but it also makes life more confusing. People conceived of time differently in the pre-digital era. They considered time to be linear and thought they could only be in any one given physical space – where their body happened to be! A person’s day would play out like a series of linear stories. Each story had a specific setting, whether it was home, the office or the mall. When you were in a particular setting, you were completely absorbed in it and not connected to the other environments in your life.  The modern world is different. Today, each person has a collection of digital selves that take place in other spaces, though the spaces are no longer physical. We can call our digitally fragmented identities digiphrenia. You might have a Facebook profile, some well-crafted online gaming avatars or even an anonymous handle you use to troll message boards. Each “self” is unique and serves a separate purpose. And these identities can be much more extreme. Consider a drone pilot who goes to work and kills people from the comfort of his office chair, then returns home safely to his family. This takes its toll: drone pilots are more likely to develop PTSD than pilots physically flying in Afghanistan. We’re also taken out of our present environments by constant streams of what seem to be real-time information, like Facebook or Twitter notifications. Your phone might even vibrate each time one comes in, repeatedly distracting you from the outside world. These updates take you out of the moment. The live feed might seem like a part of the present but each notification refers to an event in the past, probably in a different place. And how often are these updates really important? Young people imagine that life lasts forever. Yet when you zoom out, the whole of human history seems to have lasted just a moment. The Big Bang happened about 13 billion years ago but modern humans have only been around for 200,000 years.  Does this mean there are multiple kinds of time? Not exactly. But there are several timescales, according to the writer Stewart Brand.  Brand wrote that different kinds of changes happen simultaneously, but at varied speeds. Just imagine six concentric rings rotating around each other. The outermost ring is the slowest and the innermost is the fastest.  The outermost ring is for very slow developments like geological changes. It can take eons for a glacier to carve out a valley. Cultural changes are also slow but happen faster than geological shifts. A culture usually lasts for about a millennium, like the ancient Mayan or Roman civilizations.  Governance, or systems of power, change within the same civilization. A civilization might change from a monarchy to a republic, for instance.  Within a given culture, fashions change even faster. Commerce and trade are driven largely by a society’s evolving tastes. All of these changes can be in process at the same time but they play out on various timescales. And changes on one timescale can influence another. When a culture declines, for example, it may be easier for a tyrant from another culture to take it over and alter the governance.  Our state of present shock, however, has muddled our understanding of timescales. We get confused about changes that should occur on slower timescales because we’re so fixated on the present.  That’s why politicians, who should operate on the timescale of governance, often focus too much on immediate results like polls, which change very quickly like fashions. Sometimes they do this deliberately but sometimes they have no choice, as it’s all their voters can understand. The key message in this book: In the last century, we imagined what technology could do for our future. Today, we use it to focus on the present. We’re bombarded with information that takes us out of the moment and prevents us from thinking about the future, and we prefer story structures as fragmented as our daily lives. We even understand time differently. Our technology has changed our lives fundamentally – it has put us in a state of present shock.  Got feedback?

Reagle Jr.","summary":"The internet has given us many outlets for our opinions as sites offer channels to post and share comments. Today everyone has a voice, and we can let people know what we think immediately, nearly anywhere in the world – an amazing development. Or is it? While there are many benefits to online commentary, the freedom a user enjoys online comes with a dark side, too. These blinks explore the advantages and disadvantages of this new way of communicating. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the sandwich technique is the tastiest way to give feedback; why a Linux user board is meaner than a fan fiction review board; and why people prefer their Facebook profile to a mirror. Thanks to the internet, online commentary is booming. Users can convey their opinions in many different ways, from awarding stars to writing in-depth reviews. But our passion for commenting wasn’t born online. It has precedent in history. Take the Michelin guide. Established in the early twentieth century, the guide not only helped drivers navigate highways safely, but was also the first to offer a star-based rating system for hotels, gas stations and other services along the way. Consider, too, printed book reviews. As unprecedented numbers of books and articles were published following the Enlightenment period, periodicals such as London’s Monthly Review and the New York Times Book Review cropped up to assist readers in deciding which books they should be reading. While experts penned these early guides and reviews, other review platforms that allow anybody to share a thought or opinion have been around for decades. The Zagat Survey, for example, leveraged the wisdom of the crowd to rate the quality of restaurants, hotels and even music. Founded in 1979, Zagat reviews were a hit long before Yelp! When you share your opinion about another person’s work, however, you also offer a form of commentary: it’s called giving feedback. We’ll explore the implications of this sort of commentary in the online world in the next blink. Feedback is a form of commentary marked by the intention to help. Feedback can be challenging to deliver, as different audiences require different approaches. But once you’ve found the right balance in your feedback, you’ll have found a beneficial way of offering commentary. You’re no doubt familiar with the concept of constructive feedback. Effective, constructive feedback encourages individuals to keep chasing a goal, boosts self-esteem and offers actionable recommendations on improving performance. This is in contrast to feedback which simply criticizes, condemns or complains. A simple way to ensure that feedback remains constructive is to use the sandwich technique. Begin by praising the work, then share your critique, then again offer praise. Constructive feedback for an essay in “sandwich” form might sound like this: “The beginning really had me keen to know more. The second paragraph, however, was a little confusing. But the ending definitely grabbed me!” Not everyone is looking for praise, though. While a novice might respond better to praise, an expert might prefer more negative feedback, in the form of pure critique. Why would this be the case? In general, beginners are looking for feedback to help them stay committed to a goal. Experts, on the other hand, are more concerned with finding ways to progress and improve. This difference is reflected in the tone with which feedback is offered in online communities. Communities that bring together amateurs, such as fan fiction communities, usually trend toward offering friendly or positive feedback on work. Communities of experts, however, such as a group for Linux developers, are clearly geared toward offering concrete, often negative, feedback. No matter which camp you find yourself in, there are a few rules of thumb for giving feedback that can help. Educational psychologist Valerie Shute discovered two important things after studying over 100 articles about formative feedback. First, she found that feedback should focus on the task of the learner and not on the personality of the learner; and second, that specific, clear feedback is best communicated in writing rather than via conversation. Although the internet has expanded the number of channels through which we can express ourselves, most channels are noisy. They’re noisy because they’re self-organized and context-driven. As a result of this, online popularity and good quality posts don’t always go hand in hand. Consider social news site Slashdot, for example. Users on Slashdot can rate comments on posts from -1 to +5, the latter being the best score. Comments with the lowest ratings are considered poor and are made invisible. This system often backfires, however, as most users tend to rate comments that have already been rated, disregarding other potentially valuable comments that might also deserve a rating. Another difficulty with online commentary is that individuals use vastly different subjective scales when evaluating comments or events. This discrepancy makes what seems a simple review system far more difficult to interpret than you might think. Some users might feel a product that works well deserves three stars, but no more. Other more lenient users might offer four or five stars, even if they aren’t 100 percent satisfied with the product. Also, online review systems force users to review a product’s range of features with a single rating, which makes that single rating tough to decipher. Finally, online commentary can be confusing for readers lacking the context for a post. In this case, it’s often hard for a reader to discern the commenter’s intention. Some users might post a note about a previous comment and assume that, since everyone has been following along, other readers will immediately “get” the reference. If a comment is retweeted, reposted or forwarded without the necessary context, however, it’s all too easy to get the wrong idea about what a person originally wanted to convey. In such a situation, this can even lead to other readers taking offense. But it’s not the users’ fault that most online communication channels are so noisy. Often, channels are being manipulated to raise the level of noise. Find out how this is done in the next blink. Online reviews are a solution to a real problem, allowing potential customers to learn about the quality of a certain product or service before spending any cash. Good online reviews can be powerful, boost customer numbers and, in turn, increase revenue for a company. Because of this, online reviews are increasingly manipulated. And who’s surprised? In one study, researchers observed 610,713 online reviews for 4,490 books. They discovered that the probability of seeing a positive review followed by a negative review was 72 percent. This was 2.6 times greater than the chance of seeing a negative review followed by another negative review. The researchers concluded that 10.3 percent of online reviews were thus subject to manipulation. Cornell University sociology professor Trevor Pinch found that companies, too, can be dishonest when it comes to product reviews. A seller of SLR cameras, for example, might copy a positive review for a competing camera, then post that same review for its own product! And it doesn’t stop there. Buying fake reviews has become an illicit market of its own. In 2010, entrepreneur Jason Rutherford launched GettingBookReviews. His service allows companies to pay for positive reviews, sometimes exaggeratedly so, on major book sites, including on Amazon.com. On community site Craigslist, you can find many company job postings asking for freelance help in writing positive product reviews for cash. Some sites have already taken steps to crack down on manipulation, but fraudulent reviewers seem to keep getting smarter. The CAPTCHA system has been long effective at keeping rating bots out of comment sections, but even this system can be hacked and must be updated frequently to ensure security. Any user can choose to comment anonymously online. You have the freedom to write to whomever you want and however you want. This anonymity can lead to communication that might never happen if the people in question were speaking face to face. Faceless people, sadly, are often tempted to behave immorally. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his writings examined whether people would continue to behave morally if they could act anonymously. He illustrated this dilemma in the story of Gyges, a shepherd who finds a ring that makes him invisible. He eventually uses this ring to commit a series of immoral acts. Psychologist Tatsuya Nogami in a recent study asked 100 university students to flip a coin twice and were told that they would receive a reward if they got two tails. The researchers did not observe the students as they flipped, however. Although statistically, flipping a coin twice and getting two tails should only happen 25 percent of the time, a rather suspicious 46 percent of students reported that they had indeed flipped two tails. Anonymity not only can make people greedy but it can also make people act cruelly. Fantasy writer Foz Meadows defines bullying as an imbalance of power, in which stronger individuals undermine the opinions of and belittle a weaker person. Many people use online anonymity to engage in cyberbullying – deliberately targeting the opinions and reputation of other online personalities. Cyberbullying attacks are rife on Goodreads, an online platform where budding writers can share work. Many authors have been the targets of attacks, launched seemingly for fun. These authors might receive numerous  negative reviews in a single day, as bullies team up to destroy their online reputation. Then, of course, there are trolls – users who enjoy posting inflammatory comments to both start fights and attract attention online. Linguist Susan Herring describes how trolls send messages that appear sincere but are designed to provoke a response that leads to a pointless argument. Of course, you know what a “selfie” is. Referring to a picture taken of yourself and posted to social media, selfie was the international word of the year in 2013. One of the pleasures of having an online presence is the freedom to create a powerful self-image. The flipside, however, is that “selfie” culture has spawned a boom in narcissistic behavior. Psychologists Amy Gonzalez and Jeffrey Hancock explored how looking in the mirror might compare to looking at a Facebook profile. They asked half of their participants to look at themselves in a mirror, and instructed the other half to visit their Facebook profile. The researchers found that participants who looked in a mirror reported lower self-esteem, while those who looked at their Facebook profile reported higher self-esteem. Why the difference? Gonzalez and Hancock attributed Facebook’s ego-boosting power to a user’s ability to control or change his or her profile. Interestingly, participants who modified their profile during the experiment reported even higher self-esteem than participants who only looked at their profile. Authors Jean Twenge and Keith Campbell believe that the internet has created a narcissism epidemic. It’s not difficult to see their point, as most blogs seem to be nothing but exercises in vanity, while valuable, informative content remains buried under digital reams of self-promotion. While posting flattering photos of yourself or receiving copious “likes” from friends might boost your self-esteem, those same posts and likes could be lowering your friends’ self-esteem at the same time. Psychologist Alex Jordan found that people often overestimate how happy other people are, as we simply cannot know what’s going on behind closed doors. We base social comparisons, which deflate our self-esteem, on external appearances – an action all too easy when looking at shiny, happy photos of peers online. People of course only share their best moments online, not the depressing or mundane ones. Celebrities in particular engage in fierce competition, spending huge amounts of money and effort on promoting a flawless, enviable social image. Spend hours looking at these over-produced, airbrushed images and you’re more than likely to feel unhappy about your life! The key message in this book: Online comments offer society a fascinating new mode of communication. Comments can produce both positive and negative results; good comments include constructive feedback and helpful product reviews, while bad comments run the gamut from manipulative advertising, to cyberbullying, to online narcissism. Regardless of quality or tenor, online commenting is a psychological and social phenomenon that deserves greater attention. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Perhaps you’ve come across some know-it-all who dismissed your arguments with a lofty “Well, what the data actually shows is…” There seems to be a growing tendency for algorithms and automated number crunching to be prioritized over philosophy- and humanities-based thinking. This skewed focus compromises education and business, and has detrimental effects on society. In these blinks, you’ll find out why we should instead turn to “sensemaking,” a better way to engage with the culture around us. You’ll also learn how big data failed to predict the H1N1 pandemic; how investor George Soros used sensemaking to make $650 million in a single day; and how the FBI freed a captive by using sensemaking. Compared to the mechanical efficiency of computers, it’s clear our human thought processes are flawed. Yet we do have one distinct advantage over machines: cultural knowledge. This cultural knowledge can be most powerfully harnessed in a method called sensemaking. Sensemaking is the process by which we gain wisdom through examining cultural knowledge. It’s a kind of cultural engagement closely associated with the humanities. For example, it might seem normal today to look to numbers for meaning, but sensemaking allows us to go further than sales figures, turnover rates and the like. It gives us a 360-degree perspective on the world. There are five basic elements to sensemaking. Firstly, sensemaking understands that humans shouldn’t just be defined by their individual personalities. People are also characterized by their cultural context. Secondly, look for thick data. Thick data establishes what is significant in a given culture. For instance, the fact that 86 percent of US households might drink more than six quarts of milk per week is thin data. Thick data would help us understand what milk means to them and why they drink it. Thirdly, consider that human behavior is best understood as existing in social contexts, rather than abstractly. Take love, for instance. It’s so much more than a chemical reaction in the brain that can be studied in a lab. To understand it fully we’d have to look at how love has been experienced in, say, classical India or the West today. Fourthly, you shouldn’t look just to strict logical processes. Insights can be gained through immersion, intuition and hypothesizing. The final precept reminds us that we shouldn’t get our bearings from data alone. If we attune ourselves to the world – looking to the stars, not GPS – we can also reach significant insights. Sensemaking is needed more than ever today. Just look at how the Silicon Valley mind-set is threatening humanities-based thinking. After all, the proponents of Silicon Valley think that technology can fix any problem, no matter what it is. However, this Silicon Valley mind-set is completely at odds with the five principles of sensemaking. Just look at three of Silicon Valley’s central precepts. Firstly, the notion of disruptive innovation is critical. Instead of setting out to simply sell new products, tech companies aim to overturn the market and create something radically new. Nothing could be further from the intellectual traditions of the humanities. The humanities are all about understanding the place of ideas and concepts within contemporary and past cultures. Secondly, Silicon Valley is obsessed with the statistical analysis of big data or poring over extremely large data sets. In 2008 Google developed Google Flu Trends. The company wanted to use search trends to predict influenza outbreaks. It was a huge failure. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic went unnoticed, while 2012 and 2013 were predicted to be huge flu years. They weren’t. Google’s algorithm was thrown by searches related to flu season, which has little to do with actual flu outbreaks. It noticed correlations between different searches, but obviously, it couldn’t decipher the intention of each search. Correlated queries like “chicken soup” started churning up false flu warnings! Thirdly, Silicon Valley loves frictionless technology, which operates smoothly and intuitively, without needing any active human input. You’ll recognize this from the way Google and Facebook filter the information that reaches you, as they try to guess your preferences or what you might want to buy. But frictionless technology traps us in a filter bubble where we get exposed to the same things again and again. But real human interaction doesn’t work like that, despite Silicon Valley’s best efforts. The first precept of sensemaking – that humans are defined by their cultural context – can be put to great use in business. Ford did just this when the firm wanted to overhaul its luxury Lincoln automobile range. Times were bad for the Lincoln; it held a meager 5.5 percent share of the luxury car market. Of course, Ford had plenty of general data about the market situation and their customers. They knew how old Lincoln owners were and where they came from, but they lacked a deeper understanding of their customers' cultural context. This is where sensemaking came in. Ford devised a comprehensive study to establish the vehicle ecologies of their customers. That is, they wanted to understand their typical customer’s social structures. Over half a year, they tapped the wives, husbands, sisters, brothers, neighbors and friends of 60 of their customers. They wanted to get a real sense of who they really were and what motivated them. They discovered that Ford’s emphasis on engineering and technical specs left many customers cold. For most of them, driving was only a small part of the overall vehicular experience. The data also revealed that luxury product ownership was a form of self-expression in private spheres for these drivers. With all this data and understanding of cultural context, Ford set out to create a far more holistic product for their customers. They realized that the concept of luxury itself should be used to structure the engineering and design process of their cars. It didn’t matter if the antilock braking system or the window switches or steering wheel were the immediate focus of the design process. Each component needed to scream “luxury.” It was by using sensemaking that Ford was able to appreciate their customers' cultural context and reinvigorate the Lincoln brand. Thick data expresses what is significant in a culture. It captures more than plain facts by supplying the context. Investor George Soros is a prime example of how thick data can be used to make a fortune. In 1992, Soros became known as “The Man Who Broke the Bank of England.” He bet that the bank would have to devalue British currency. When it did, it made him a fortune of $650 million in a single day. But how did he know? He was guided by the culture of thinking at Soros Fund Management. Soros himself had studied philosophy, so data meant more than just numbers to him. It was the thick data of experiences, newspaper articles and conversations that he put to use. But what makes data thick? It’s less about objective knowledge than about recognizing the context of this data. To get a better sense of it, we'll consider the nature of knowledge. There are four types. Firstly, there is objective knowledge. It’s the basis for the natural sciences. “One plus one is two” and “water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen” are examples of objective knowledge statements. Objective knowledge is universally true. Secondly, there is subjective knowledge. This is knowledge based on personal opinions and feelings, like “I’m cold” or “I want apple pie.” Thirdly, there is shared knowledge. It’s public and cultural. It’s the shared human experience. We can talk about the Jewish experience, for example. Fourthly, there is sensory knowledge. This is what is often called the “sixth sense.” This knowledge is intuitive. Soldiers might be able to “feel” the presence of booby traps nearby and thereby avoid them. Sensemaking entails synthesizing all four types of knowledge without prioritizing any of them over the others. The third precept of sensemaking directs us to collect thick data in the real world, not some realm of abstraction. Choose the savannah, not the zoo! For instance, philosophy provides us with the concept of phenomenology. This means we should describe phenomena as they actually are and not as we think they should be. It’s phenomenology that provides the framework for translating sensemaking into real-world practice. It’s a call for us to go out and observe what people do. Instead of scrutinizing lions in a cage, we should observe them on the savannah. As a general rule, most of us are confined to the metaphorical zoos of offices or corporate strategy sessions. Instead, we should go out into the real world and use our senses to experience what’s happening. We should avoid being in hock to abstract theories and habitual assumptions. The author used sensemaking-based phenomenology to help a large and struggling European grocery chain get back on track. The chain’s technical data was great but limited in its use. The firm knew all about how much a customer spent on each visit or what women between the ages of 25 and 38 liked to buy. But they didn’t know about the actual experience of shopping and what happened to the food once it got home. The answer lay in reframing the questions put by management to customers. The best way to increase revenue was to ask how people experienced cooking. Once the company had compiled responses to this question, it was better able to understand the decisions that customers were making while in the store. Before too long, the company was firing on all cylinders again. How do you express the feeling when an idea arrives? You might use expressions like \"it came to me” or “it dawned on me.” That’s because we often feel that ideas are revealed to us from an external source. However, there’s a school of thought called design thinking which believes that ideas are generated by following a rigid mental process. In this way, creativity can essentially be manufactured. It’s as though knowledge and expertise have nothing to do with it! The most famous advocate of this approach is the design firm IDEO, headed by Stanford’s Institute of Design founder, David Kelley. The firm champions the idea that the best designers should work unencumbered by expert or specialist knowledge in a given field. It makes no difference if designers are creating a toothbrush, a tractor or a chair. They think the same design process can be applied in every circumstance and should work wonders every time. But this approach is clearly nonsense. Creativity doesn’t work like this. The author sampled his friends and colleagues and asked them what they thought about the creative process. He found that creative ideas were stirred by immersion into and sensitivity toward the field in question. Immersion is, in essence, an empathic dive into another world. Receptivity and openness, often understood by taking on board relevant stories and anecdotes, were found to be essential tools in getting a proper hold of the context needed to create solutions. You’ve got to be open to ideas, the author’s friends said. Creative ideas rained down on them when they least expected it. That’s how Henry Ford created his famous car-building factory line. It was his observation of how pigs were processed in slaughterhouses, piece by piece, which went on to trigger his creative impulse in the automotive industry. At the US Naval Academy, students aren’t just trained to navigate using GPS satellite technology. They’re also taught how to plot a course using the night sky. For good reason. The best navigators should be able to interpret information from a variety of available sources – not just technology. Sensemaking works like this too. It encourages us to interpret the world through social intuition, active listening and cultural context. FBI agent Chris Voss used just such a method to free the kidnapped American journalist Jill Carroll in 2006. He and his team navigated the crisis by using sensemaking, specifically by interpreting Arabic culture. On January 7, 2006, Jill Carroll was kidnapped in Baghdad. A few days later a video of her and her captors was shown on Al Jazeera.  As was normal practice, the FBI summoned up a team of skilled negotiators. Among them was Chris Voss. They set about developing an appreciation of the cultural matters that were of most importance to the Iraqi insurgents. In the first instance, they recognized the importance of family and family honor in Middle Eastern cultures. So they filmed Carroll’s father addressing the kidnappers directly. They also noticed a detail in the kidnapper’s video. They had left Carroll's head uncovered. This was unusual, as it’s a sign of disrespect in Arabic culture. Consequently, Voss’s team used this point to smear the captors’ reputation in the Iraqi media. In the next ransom video, the kidnappers put Carroll in full Islamic dress. The FBI’s tactic worked because it exposed the kidnappers’ weakness. Soon, the kidnappers were just trying to work out how to let her go without losing face as they were sensitive about being criticized for disrespecting Arabic culture. On 30 March, Jill Carroll was released. All it took was a bit of effort navigating through Middle Eastern culture. There is an art, you see, to navigation. The key message in this book: Sensemaking is about understanding human culture and the context in which it operates. In contrast with the data-driven way the natural sciences encourage us to interpret the world, sensemaking is rooted in the humanities and acknowledges the richness of human culture, of people’s stories, art, philosophy, and history.

If there’s one constant in history, it’s that every society has its fair share of doom-mongers forecasting the end of days and lamenting the fact that everything’s gone to the dogs. Pessimism is, in part, a matter of temperament. The pessimist takes a look at the optimist’s half-full glass and declares that it’s half empty. But it’s also a matter of perspective. While the pessimist complains that the glass isn’t filled to the brim, the optimist takes the longer view. What if the glass itself tends to get bigger and bigger over time? Things might not be perfect, but there’s certainly a lot more water to go around today than there was yesterday. That’s essentially the view defended in these blinks. From poverty to preventable disease epidemics, the author argues that there’s still a lot to be done. But we shouldn’t forget just how far we’ve come. We’re healthier, richer and more tolerant than at any other time in human history. If it doesn’t feel like it, it’s because we’re so fixated on what’s in front of our noses that we often forget to take a broader view. Chock-full of data on everything from global literacy rates, GDP growth, food scarcity and political equality, these blinks are an impassioned defense of progress and the optimism that comes with perspective. In these blinks, you’ll learn why prosperity is the cornerstone of environmentalism; why wars are much less lethal than they used to be; and why literacy is so important to tackling poverty. In past centuries, life in Europe was a bleak affair. Hungry children roaming from house to house in search of food, beggars dying in the streets – each was a common enough scene in the seventeenth century. Famine was ubiquitous. Hunger was part and parcel of human life. It’s only recently that this started to change. In the seventeenth century, millions of lives were lost to food scarcity. Take Finland. Historical estimates suggest that around a third of the population died as a result of famine between 1695 and 1697. Desperation even drove many to cannibalism. Accounts from the period suggest it occurred in Sweden and again in France in 1662. Food shortages persisted into subsequent centuries. Average calorie consumption in France and England in the eighteenth century was lower than it currently is in sub-Saharan Africa – the most undernourished region in the world. But with technological advances and global trade came a rapid increase in food production. More and more people were freed from hunger. When farmers were granted property rights in the nineteenth century, they were given an incentive to produce more food, as they could sell surplus crops for profit. Meanwhile, opening up borders to global trade provided different regions with an opportunity to specialize in particular areas. That made food production much more efficient. Scientists and entrepreneurs also played their part. They developed innovations like artificial fertilizer, modern milking machines and combine harvesters. The effect was dramatic. Take the combine harvester. A single machine can now do as much work in just six minutes as 25 men once did in a day. That’s a whopping 2,500-fold increase in productivity! Globally, the results are just as impressive. In 1961, there were 51 countries in which the average person consumed less than 2,000 calories a day. By 2013, there was only one – Zambia. Undernourishment has dropped significantly. In 1945, around half the world’s population didn’t have enough to eat. Today, that’s been cut to around 10 percent. Defeating chronic hunger is still work in progress. But victory is in sight. That’s a great reason to look forward to the future. But it’s not just more efficient food production that has improved human health. One of the most effective ways of preventing disease and boosting life expectancy is proper waste disposal. Today, most cities are relatively clean. Nineteenth-century cities were something else entirely. The streets back then were filled with human and animal excrement. Rivers were contaminated with waste products. The stench was unbelievable. That made cities ideal breeding grounds for disease. Between 1848 and 1854 cholera broke out in London and claimed thousands of lives. During that outbreak, the London-based physician John Snow made a medical breakthrough. While mapping the spread of the disease, he realized that the main source was a company that collected water downstream from sewage outlets. Snow’s discovery was a eureka moment. London quickly introduced sophisticated water systems and, eventually, chlorination and filtering. Later still, garbage collection was introduced in cities around the world. Making urban areas more hygienic significantly reduced mortality rates. Such changes, however, were slow in coming to low- and middle-income countries. But there’s been significant progress over the last few decades. Between 1980 and 2015, the proportion of the world’s population with access to safe drinking water rose from 52 to 91 percent! Medical progress has also helped boost life expectancy around the world. That’s down to new methods. After centuries of outlandish theories and strange practices, medicine switched to an evidence-based scientific approach. The result? Life expectancy saw a dramatic and, most importantly, sustained rise for the first time in the history of the human species. Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered penicillin, was an early pioneer. Later scientists have also chalked up plenty of successes. From the prevention of polio and malaria to the treatment of AIDS and the introduction of mass-vaccination programs, medical advances have steadily pushed diseases back. Globalization is an ally in the fight against human disease. In our networked age, information is easier to get hold of than ever before. That means outbreaks are easier to track and vaccines can be developed more swiftly. To see just how effective that’s been, compare the current average life expectancy with that at the start of the twentieth century. In the early decades of the last century, the average person could expect to live to 31. By 2015, the worldwide average was 71. That’s extraordinary when you consider that average life expectancy hovered around 30 years for the previous eight thousand generations. Life used to be nasty, brutish and – above all – short. Thanks to medical advances, that’s a thing of the past. Poverty has been the natural lot of humans for most of our history. That means we shouldn’t ask what causes poverty. The better question is, “What drives prosperity?” Over the last 200 years, humanity has witnessed an extraordinary transformation. Since the industrial age, we’ve experienced history’s largest increase in global wealth. The Industrial Revolution first took off in England in the 1800s. The state loosened its hold over economic life and people started experimenting with new technologies. That led to widespread mechanization and a huge boost to productivity. The effects soon made themselves felt. The average real earnings of English workers doubled between 1820 and 1850. Thirty years seems like a long time, right? But consider this. Before the industrial age, it would have taken an average worker around two millennia to double his income! The English example was followed by other great economic expansions in the second half of the twentieth century. Asian nations, such as Japan and South Korea, and later China and India, opened up their economies and reaped the benefits. Japan, for example, saw its GDP increase by a factor of eleven after 1950. China experienced even more dramatic growth; its GDP increased by a factor of twenty. Nor has GDP growth benefitted economic powerhouses alone. It’s also cut poverty worldwide. While growth has been strongest in developing countries in Asia, it’s also improved life in regions that have expanded less dramatically, such as sub-Saharan Africa. That’s great news for the world’s poorest people. In developing countries, the number of people living in extreme poverty – defined as having less than $1.90 per day in 2005 prices – fell from 53.9 percent in 1981 to 11.9 percent in 2015. Globally, that amounts to a fall from 44.3 percent to 9.6 percent over the same period. So what drove this rapid turnaround? Well, a number of different factors came together. Oppressive regimes were dismantled around the world while socialist governments collapsed. Transport infrastructure and communication improved. Globalization also played its part. States are now more open to foreign trade, allowing them access to new markets. All that adds up to a dramatic decline in global poverty. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at our next big topic: violence. We live in the information age. Our societies are saturated in media. That means we’re more aware than ever before of the violence that affects countries around the world. But just because we’re more attuned to it doesn’t mean violence is also on the rise. In fact, violence is declining. Ever more sophisticated judicial mechanisms and the rise of humanitarian ideas since the Enlightenment have put a brake on brutality. Both homicide and torture have been steadily declining. Murder rates first started declining in Europe in the early modern era. England and the Netherlands, the most commercialized and literate societies of the age, led the way. Centralized governments and modern legal systems were key to this transformation. As institutions started providing stability, individuals no longer had to resort to violence to secure their social status. The fall in homicide rates was astonishing. In the sixteenth century, for example, there were 19 murders per 100,000 people in Europe. Today, that’s dropped to 1 homicide per 100,000 citizens. And crime rates aren’t the only thing that’s improved. Since the Enlightenment coined the concept of proportional punishment, criminals have been treated with greater leniency. In the nineteenth century, execution and torture became less common penalties. Justice was increasingly humane. And although torture still exists even in advanced democracies, it’s now an exception to the norm. Violence between states has also become less common. Global commerce means that it’s more profitable to produce value and exchange it rather than relying on plunder. The upshot? Governments try to avoid wars. As the Austrian-American economist Ludwig von Mises once said, if the tailor wants to fight the baker, he better learn to start making his own bread! And because we live in an information age, news of atrocities gets out quickly. Today, a state’s misdeeds come under more scrutiny than ever before. In addition to media outlets, international institutions have also played their part in regulating violence. The United Nations, for example, which was founded after the horrific wars of the mid-twentieth century, makes it a lot harder for despots to resort to war. Violence is now a potential public-relations disaster. That’s been extraordinarily effective in making armed conflict both less common and less lethal. Wars between states now claim an average of 3,000 lives per conflict. In the 1950s, by comparison, the number of victims was closer to 86,000! Rapid economic growth hasn’t been all good news. The environmental costs have been high, and the damage we’ve inflicted on our planet is a hot-button topic today. But growth and environmental conservation aren’t mutually exclusive. In fact, the progress we’ve made in protecting the planet is in large part the result of our increasing wealth. Rapid industrialization harmed the natural environment. But there have been significant improvements in recent decades. Take London. In the 1950s, it suffered from what was called the “Great Smog” at the time. Locals burned huge amounts of coal to keep the cold at bay in winter. The smoke, combined with industrial emissions, created a cloud of smog that engulfed the city. Around 12,000 people died as a result. For three centuries, all the way up to the 1970s, the city’s pollution rose. But after that, it decreased sharply and returned to pre-industrial levels, due, in large part, to the development of cleaner technologies. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, the toxic compound in smog, have fallen by 94 percent since the 1970s. But it’s not just the United Kingdom that’s seen improvements. Worldwide, 172 out of 178 countries made progress between 2004 and 2014 according to the Environmental Progress Index. That’s not surprising. Evidence from today’s most wealthy countries suggests that the best way to protect the environment is to reduce poverty. If you plot national wealth against environmental damage, you end up with a bell-shaped curve. As countries first become more prosperous, damage to the environment increases. But when you reach the tip of the hump, the relationship reverses. Once a certain level of wealth has been reached, damage to the environment decreases. There’s a simple reason for this. Taking care of the environment becomes a priority once other, more basic needs have been met. Put differently, conservation becomes important only once you know that your family has enough to eat. Poverty and environmental risks also interact in another way. Today, the countries most at risk from climate change and natural disasters are the poorest nations. But as they become more affluent, we can expect improvements in infrastructure, health care, technology and warning systems. That will limit potential damages. That means that the best weapon against environmental pollution is creating more wealth. It’s sometimes thought that wealth is to blame for damage to the environment. But that’s putting the cart before the horse. Prosperity isn’t the problem; it’s the solution. It’s hard to overstate just how important literacy is. Reading and writing expand people’s horizons and open new doors. Once you’ve learned to read, it’s easier to stay informed and pick up new ideas. Literacy is also vital when it comes to finding a decent job. Without it, it’s impossible to acquire new skills that are in demand on the labor market. So it’s clear that improving education and teaching people to read and write is an essential precondition of improving their standard of living. But the question remains: How can we boost literacy levels? Well, the road to global literacy is paved with higher incomes, peace and mass-literacy campaigns. Each improves education around the world. And the changes that we’ve already witnessed have been dramatic. Two hundred years ago, roughly 12 percent of the world’s population knew how to read and write; as of 2015, only about 14 percent of the world population couldn’t read or write. In late-eighteenth-century Europe, there were few alternatives to a religious education. And while churches provided access to the basics, they were mainly interested in teaching people to read religious texts. That started to change in the nineteenth century. Charities and philanthropists began funding schools for the poor while governments rolled out compulsory education programs. By the twentieth century, this positive trend had reached developing countries. Thanks to formal schooling, mass literacy campaigns, private initiatives and greater prosperity, education became more widely available and better funded. As a result, the global literacy rate increased to today’s impressive percentage. And even though there are more people on earth than ever before, the number of children not in school has dropped from 100 million to 57 million over the same period. That’s a boon for the most disenfranchised. Education has created opportunities for them to learn new skills and improve their lives. Poor countries and women have been the biggest beneficiaries. In the former, literacy increased from around 50 percent to 80 percent of all citizens between 1970 and the present. And the ratio of girls to boys enrolled in primary and secondary schools, as well as universities, is now almost equal. In 1990, there were around eight girls in education for every ten boys. In most low- and middle-income countries today, the ratio is closer to 1:1. Discrimination based on gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation has been ubiquitous for most of human history. And although it still scars many of today’s societies, it is declining. In fact, we’ve made great progress toward achieving equality – a positive step driven by the rise of tolerance and egalitarian ideas. Two developments have done more than any others to expand our personal and political freedoms: democratization and the global ban on slavery. Let’s start with slavery. It existed in virtually every country as late as 1800. Today, it’s banned by every nation on earth. Sadly, forced labor, forced marriage and human trafficking still exist – but they’re no longer defended as a matter of principle. Then there’s democracy. In 1900, there wasn’t a single electoral democracy in the world in which every man and woman could vote. That changed thanks to the pressure for reform from the middle classes and property owners, in the nineteenth century, and the labor and women’s rights movements, in the twentieth. Thanks to those efforts, universal suffrage began to spread around the globe. So much so that, by 2000, around 58 percent of the world’s population lived in electoral democracies! And while bigotry is still around, we’re moving toward a more tolerant world. Today, ethnic and religious minorities, as well as women and gay people, enjoy more rights and greater protection against discrimination than ever before. Take racial discrimination. Around 150 African-Americans were lynched every year in the United States during the nineteenth century. Segregation was only finally dismantled in the 1960s. Women also faced widespread discrimination. Before reforms were passed in the twentieth century, they weren’t allowed to vote or own property. Today, women are a firm fixture in the political institutions of virtually every nation except Saudi Arabia and the Vatican. Or take same-sex marriage. Before the twenty-first century, there were no countries in which same-sex partners could marry. Now, there are 21 nations where gay people can legally tie the knot. Meanwhile, discrimination against ethnic groups was officially banned in the 1990s. We saw earlier how wealth is linked to protecting the environment. Well, prosperity plays its part here, too. Research shows that societies become more tolerant and inclusive as they grow more affluent. Once people have financial security, they’re less likely to see other groups struggling for civil rights as a threat to their own welfare. So there’s been a great deal of progress in recent decades. This means that younger generations will grow up in a world that’s richer, healthier and more tolerant than at any other time in history. But there’s no reason why things can’t get even better! Today’s children live in a world that previous generations could only have dreamed of. Consider child labor. Before industrialization, it was part and parcel of growing up for millions of children. In seventeenth-century France during the reign of Louis XIV, for example, parents were fined if they didn’t send their children out to work. And even as late as the mid-nineteenth century, around 20 percent of all English and Welsh children had to work. Thankfully, that number was gradually reduced to zero. Child labor has been declining across the world, too. In Africa and Asia, some 40 percent of children were in employment in 1950. Today, that percentage has dropped below 10. That’s a result of increased prosperity. As parents become wealthier, they no longer depend on the labor of their offspring to get by. The “skill premium” also plays a role in this. As it becomes possible to earn more by learning specialized skills, it makes more sense to invest in children’s futures by educating them. So today’s younger generations live in a world that’s much better than that of their ancestors. But there’s no reason to think they’ll rest on their laurels. The next generations are likely to build on past successes and go on changing the world for the better. That’s important. There are still serious problems that need solving. Undernourishment, preventable disease epidemics, poverty and bigotry are all still issues, even if they’re gradually becoming less pressing. And the tools to make the world a better place are ready to hand. In Newton’s era, knowledge was a privilege of the elites. Today, however, globalization means that billions of people have access to information and new ideas. That means we’re closer than ever before to living in a world where every one of us can contribute to improving human life and society. The key message in these blinks: Turn on the news and you’ll be bombarded with images suggesting a world in disarray. But the fact is, we’ve never had it so good. We’re healthier, wealthier and safer than ever before in human history. From literacy to equality, freedom to food quality, we’ve made stunning progress in recent times. Progress, in other words, is real. And there’s nothing to suggest that things can’t go on getting better in the future! Actionable advice: Be skeptical of pessimists.  Populists and pessimists often claim that everything’s going to the dogs. But don’t be fooled – the world was a lot more dangerous, unpleasant and poorer yesterday than it is today. So next time you hear someone lamenting the “good old days” of yesteryear, be sure to take it with a large pinch of salt. Chances are that the true golden age belongs to the future, not the past!

Social Engineering is more than just an inherent skill of sweet talking and social adeptness; it’s a whole science that is used by scammers, as well as the very people who try to prevent scammers. In these blinks, we will take a close look at the foundations of Social Engineering, how it works and the techniques that it entails. In these blinks, you’ll discover how a website about stamp collecting opened up a security gap; how 734,000 social media users all chose their first name as their password; and why a picture of your children could make you vulnerable to Social Engineering. Have you ever been persuaded into buying something only to realize later on that you don’t need or want whatever you’ve bought? If so, you’re not alone. Most of us have been brought under the influence of some social engineering tactic at one point or another. Social engineering is a set of psychological tricks that exploit human vulnerabilities to influence a target’s actions. These tricks can manifest themselves as spoken language, body language and hidden suggestions. Governments, salespeople and law enforcement officers are deeply familiar with these tactics, but the fact is that we all use social engineering, even with our friends, family and co-workers. For example, when a kid says “I love you, Mommy. Can I have a puppy for my birthday?” they are using social engineering to influence their parent. Of course, social engineering isn’t only about short-term gain; it can actually be used to do great harm to people. Scammers and con artists, for instance, use social engineering to manipulate their targets and compromise security systems. If you want to install malware onto a company’s server, you could go in guns blazing and fight your way to the server room. But that’s messy. A social engineer will instead do something like disguise themselves as an IT specialist and prepare a convincing story to get past security.  Once inside, they’re free to do what they want and no one will be the wiser. As far as the security guard knows, the “IT person” was just doing their job. But no one wants to be conned like this. Luckily, we can protect ourselves with a solid understanding of how social engineering works. Security auditors, like the author, are hired to play the role of malicious social engineers to test a client’s security system by performing authorized penetration tests, or pentests for short, which are basically fake social engineering attacks. The client, of course, doesn’t know when, where or how this will happen. Whether you’re a security auditor or a criminal social engineer, before you plan an attack, you need to know your target. The more you understand your target, the more you’ll know how to influence them, and the more effective your plan will be. Start by creating a profile of your target. A good place to start is on the internet: certain websites allow you to track a person’s e-mail address, phone number and even her IP address, while social media can also be a great resource. Be diligent! Even a minor detail can prove valuable. For example, the author’s mentor, Mati Aharoni, was once hired to do a pentest for a specific company. Aharoni discovered that one of the company’s high-ranking officials used his company e-mail on a stamp collectors’ forum. So, Aharoni created a website with a stamp-related address and embedded a program that made it possible to access the target’s computer. He then called the official, asked if he would be interested in buying his “deceased grandfather’s stamp collection” and offered to send him a link to the website. The target, caught completely unawares, happily accepted – and fell for the trap. As you can see, even the most seemingly trivial information can have a big payoff! You can also learn a lot about someone through simple observation of his daily life. It’s a good practice to follow your target through her daily routine. What places does she always visit? Does she smoke? If your target is a company, do employees use keys or magnetic cards to enter the building? Does the building have security cameras? Finally, while it is certainly not glamorous, you can nonetheless glean important information by looking through your target’s garbage. People throw out CDs, letters, invoices and all sorts of other things that contain important information. But be smart about it: take the bags somewhere else to avoid being caught! Imagine you’re a detective about to go undercover. Would you use your real name, address and backstory? Of course not! You’d create a backstory and alias, and use everything you know to design a solid plan to go undercover. It all starts with a pretext, that is, a scenario that makes your target feel comfortable doing something they normally wouldn’t. This is why it’s so important to gather good information about your target in the beginning: the better your information about them, the more convincing the pretext will be. Let’s say your target is a CEO who regularly donates to a charity. This knowledge could be useful in creating your pretext. As a potential way to meet with the CEO, you could pretend to be a salesperson offering to donate a percentage of a purchase to the CEO’s preferred charity. After all, CEOs won’t see just anybody, and mentioning this charity improves your chances. When crafting your identity, it’s important to draw inspiration based on your target’s interests in order to inspire their trust in you. The easiest way is to find a real common interest that you share with your target. If that’s not possible, you can mold your identity to match your real expertise level in your “shared interest.” For instance, if you want to convince a chemist to reveal a patented chemical formula but aren’t a scientist yourself, posing as a fellow chemist is risky. But you could be a “student” who admires their work. Accents and dialects are another good way to connect with people. These are not too difficult to learn with a keen ear and some good instructional audiotapes. Some accents can even make you instantly likeable, depending on your environment. In a training class offered by a sales organization, the author learned that 70 percent of Americans prefer to listen to someone with a British accent! But no matter what, remember that your pretext and identity should appear logical and natural. People like to be liked, a fact social engineers know well. They also know that people who like you will do things to earn your affection. But how do you get complete strangers to like you immediately? Start by making the target feel like you have good chemistry and rapport. One way to do this is by making the conversation about the target. After all, everyone loves to talk about themselves! Be mindful of your body language. By matching their movements, you subtly demonstrate that the two of you have chemistry. For example, if they cross their arms, do the same. You can also build rapport by matching your appearance to theirs. If you’re talking to a company manager, for example, you’ll want to walk the walk and talk the talk: wear a suit and tie, and speak like they speak. Once you’ve built a rapport, you can then use elicitation to influence targets to behave as you want them to because it makes sense or feels logical to them. To use elicitation effectively, it’s important to understand a few things about people: they want to be polite to strangers, they talk more when they’re praised and they respond kindly to someone who appears concerned about them. Social engineers use this knowledge to talk anyone into complying with their suggestions. If you know your target is a parent, for example, create a pretext that includes a child. You could tell a receptionist that you had a job interview scheduled, but that your daughter accidentally spilled coffee on your briefcase this morning and you didn’t have time to print out another CV. You could note that, judging from the picture on his desk, his kid must be about the same age as your daughter. Perhaps he could help you out and print another CV for you? That’s when you can hand him a USB stick with spyware in it. Think of all the white lies you’ve ever told. Do you think people knew you were lying? Probably. But it’s not because they were listening carefully to the logic of your fib; rather, they probably read it on your face. Our faces tend to reveal our emotions involuntarily. These microexpressions flash by in less than a second, but are nonetheless unmistakable. Microexpressions are universal; people reveal their emotions in their faces in the same way, regardless of their cultural background. For example, a genuine smile triggers the muscles around the eyes called the orbicularis oculi, which, according to French neurologist Duchenne de Boulogne, can’t be moved voluntarily. While law enforcement agencies read microexpressions to detect deceit, social engineers use this information to manipulate their targets. For example, one of the author’s colleagues, Tom, noticed that his target would smile when talking about something positive. Tom started clicking a pen every time his target talked about positive things until the target began associating the click with positive emotions. Eventually, Tom clicked the pen when his target mentioned something negative. This caused him to smile, and then feel embarrassed at having smiled at something negative.  But noticeable emotions go well beyond smiles. The author identifies seven types of universal emotions, all of which have their own microexpressions: Anger makes the eyebrows slant down and together, and the lips stretch outward. Disgust wrinkles the nose and raises the upper lip. Contempt also wrinkles the nose, but raises only one side of the lip. Fear causes us to open our eyes wide, with eyebrows bunched and lips stretched outward. Surprise raises the eyebrows and drops the jaw. Sadness likewise drops the jaw, pulls the lips down and squints the eyes. Finally, happiness broadens the eyes, raises the cheeks and produces a smile. Reading your target’s microexpression can help you identify their emotions and give you the information you need to respond appropriately. Con artists are well known for their ability to talk anyone into doing anything. Many chalk this up to a natural born talent for sweet talking, but there is an actual science behind it. In this blink, we’ll examine one such science: Neuro-linguistic programming. Neuro-linguistic programming, or NLP, is a mode of communication that focuses on the way people think and experience the world. Richard Bandler and John Grinder developed NLP in the 1970s in order to study the way language patterns affect behavior. NLP focuses on the concepts of state of mind, conscious/unconscious relationships and the filters we use when making sense of reality. Salespeople and company managers learn NLP to develop self-awareness and effective ways to communicate. For example, NLP training scripts can help a salesperson to get a customer talking about their goals and dreams. The salesperson, with this new information, can then position their product in the conversation as a means to fulfill those dreams. Social engineers use NLP to covertly insert commands into their speech without alerting the target. In NLP, this skill is called ultimate voice. One way to use ultimate voice is by emphasizing the words you want the target to focus on by using your tone of voice. For example, we normally end questions like “Don’t you agree?” with an upward tone. However, if you say “agree” with a downward tone instead, it sounds like a command. Another way is to hide commanding phrases in sentences structured like soft suggestions by emphasizing certain words and commanding the listener’s subconscious. For example, when you ask “So what do you want to eat for lunch today, steak or something else?” your emphasis on “you want to eat steak” will influence the listener’s decision. These are sophisticated psychological methods that require training and practice. But if you take the time to learn them, you can greatly influence people simply by talking to them in the right way. Sometimes social engineers are confronted with a challenge that requires more than just sweet talk: locks. But no lock, be it physical or digital (in other words, password protection), is insurmountable. If you want to open up a physical lock to access personal files or other data, you’ll first need certain tools. A lock is made of uneven pin tumblers, which the key aligns in an even line. Once the tumblers are aligned, the key can turn and unlock the door. Lock picks do the same thing, except that you have to push each tumbler into position one by one. To accomplish this, you only need two tools: a tension wrench, which is just a flat piece of metal that keeps pressure on the bottom of the lock, and a pick. It’s easy: first, insert the tension wrench. Then, you use your pick, a long piece of metal with a curve at the end, to line up the tumblers. Once the tumblers are aligned, you’ll hear a click, and voilà! Passwords are a little different. Luckily for social engineers, most people’s passwords are very weak. How weak? Well, in 2009 a hacker known as Tonu copied a social media site using a web address that had recently been dropped. Out of the 734,000 people who logged into this fake site, 30,000 used their first name as their password, and 17,601 users used the password 123456. Of course, if your target’s password is something other than their first name, you’ll need to try something else. Passwords can be cracked using free software, like Common User Password Profiler, or CUPP. When the author conducts security training exercises, he asks a volunteer to type a password they think is secure into a computer. Using software like CUPP, he’s able to crack it in under two minutes. CUPP takes all the target’s personal information, like nicknames, birthdays and spouses’ names, and creates a file of probable passwords. Weak passwords can be cracked in a few days or even less. Social engineers combine all these tactics and tools to manipulate their targets without them ever being the wiser. The best way to protect ourselves is to know their methods and how they work. If you don’t want to get duped, it’s important to educate yourself and your personnel about social engineering tactics. The more you know about elicitation, body language and so on, the better equipped you will be to recognize when someone is trying to use these tactics on you. Remember, any and all information can be valuable to an attacker. So be careful what you share with unauthorized people. Be especially aware of attackers posing as a distraught person asking for help. In one case, a social engineer was able to compromise an antivirus company by calling their customer service line and asking if the software was preventing him from accessing a website designed to compromise the company.  The representative tried several times to explain to him that he simply wasn’t permitted to open the website in question, but the attacker pleaded that he go to the website to make sure anyway. Out of his desire to help, the representative ended up opening the web address and compromising the antivirus company. To avoid falling victim to social engineers, set up security protocols for all staff and follow them at all times. One way might be to develop a standard script that employees use to react to a suspicious person asking for information. It could be as simple as asking for their name and ID number and the name of the project they are inquiring about before answering any questions. If they can’t provide any of this information, then ask them to contact the company via e-mail and terminate the conversation. Of course, these are just ideas. You’ll have to develop your own system that is right for you and your company. The key message in this book: Like a computer, the human mind can be hacked. Criminals use psychological tactics, contrived cover stories and careful wording to manipulate and scam their targets. The best protection is to be aware of their methods.

Since our attention is often grabbed by other headlines, it’s likely that you don’t even know where we’re at when it comes to things like bioprinting, spaceplanes and microscopic robots. So, let Kelly and Zach Weinersmith bring you up to date on the latest developments and fill you in on when you can expect to 3D print your own custom-made home on the cheap. The answer is, probably, “soonish” – as in, not today, not tomorrow, but soonish. In these blinks, you’ll discover the difference between fission and fusion power; why a bucket of stuff is both incredible and terrifying; and why Pokémon Go is only a small step toward the incredible virtual world to come. Given that the first moon landing happened way back in 1969, you may feel disappointed that so little progress has since been made when it comes to getting humans further into space. But the reality is, building rockets and launching them into space is an expensive business, which is why scientists are looking into cheaper methods of space exploration. One such method is sort of like using a really big elevator. Imagine a giant cable stretching from a mobile sea platform on Earth all the way to a giant asteroid in orbit. It could be used to send cargo, passengers and spacecraft back and forth, eliminating the need for all that expensive and explosive rocket fuel. Sounds good, right? However, there is currently no material that is both strong enough and light enough to make a space elevator a reality – though scientists are still eagerly looking into this idea. Another potentially less expensive method is the spaceplane. Spaceplanes would use two different kinds of engines. The first would use a combination of air and fuel to create a high-pressure force powerful enough to propel the plane out of the Earth’s atmosphere. Then, because there isn’t any air in space, the spaceplane would need to switch to a more traditional rocket engine that uses normal propellant. This would be cheaper than the current method where the rocket has to carry enough expensive oxidizer to power the rocket engine all the way into space. Another important part of making space travel affordable could be asteroid mining. This has the potential to provide cheap materials that could be sent back to Earth, or used for building the settlements on other planets. The US-based company Tethers Unlimited has already proposed a system for capturing asteroids. It essentially works like a space net, and they’ve called it “the Wrangler.” It would allow us to trap an asteroid in a net, and then to use that asteroid as a base of operations for a settlement. We could also theoretically drag it elsewhere to create colonies in space or to mine its resources; from what we already know about the main types of asteroids, water, metal and oxygen can be extracted from them. There’s an important difference between nuclear fission and fusion. Fission refers to the energy produced when atoms split apart, while fusion captures the energy produced by atoms fusing together. So far, our attempts at harnessing fusion power have been inefficient and largely unsuccessful, though scientists are still hard at work trying to find a solution. There’s still much hope that fusion power will be a reliable and clean source of energy in the future. The best solution we’ve come up with so far is known as the blasting approach, which involves taking a lot of fusion fuel and blasting it with a laser to create massive reactions. This is what scientists are currently doing at Sandia Labs in the United States, in an experiment known as the MagLIF project. Scientists are using an enormous generator called the Z machine, which collapses a cylinder filled with fusion fuel, causing it to release an immense amount of fusion energy at the same instant. While the energy required to operate the Z machine is still far greater than the energy released from the fuel, scientists are continuing to improve upon the design and hope to at least break even on its energy production by 2020. If the right solutions are found, the energy yields may eventually make fusion power a reliable source of clean energy. So far, the most promising improvement is a configuration called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor or ITER, which results in a better way to confine the fuel and then heat it. In a collaboration among scientists from 35 nations, the ITER configuration plans to house the fuel, in this case plasma, in a donut-shaped chamber and confine it there through the use of magnetic fields. The plasma would then be heated to extreme temperatures, causing the atoms to fuse with each other. One advantage of ITER is that the heating process will cause multiple fusions to occur within the plasma, creating a continuous chain reaction. The problem so far has been an unfortunate series of delays and budget overruns, but there’s still hope that a functional fusion reactor will be in operation by 2027. Imagine living in a house that could change its structure depending on the weather. It might sound like pure fantasy, but such programmable matter that can change its physical properties based on its programming is actually already being worked on. As you can likely imagine, programmable matter has the potential to be a huge asset for humankind, and not just in building materials. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Daniela Rus is already experimenting with such matter in the form of origami robots. Just like paper origami, these robots can fold into different shapes thanks to actuators, or flexible machine parts, placed along specific folding lines. So far, Dr. Rus’s material of choice for these robots has been pig intestine. The hope is that one day, programmable matter robots will fold into different shapes, allowing them to travel through the body and take medicine to any specific part that a doctor might want to target. And after the robot performs a task, depending on the material, it could simply dissolve inside the body. As for the programmable house, one such project is called the HygroScope, and the programmable material in question is wood that responds to humidity by bending into different shapes, opening and closing hundreds of little pores, thereby making the material more water-resistant and durable. However, given the directions programmable material could take us, there are also some ethical questions being raised too. If we take this technology to its logical ultimate goal, we’ll eventually get to the Bucket of Stuff: a container of a goo-like substance that could be programmed to turn into whatever you need, such as a hammer, a wrench or a bowl. Now, what would prevent someone from buying a Bucket of Stuff to make a gun or some other weapon? Indeed, 3D printing has already raised similar difficult questions for lawmakers. And with the idea of programmable matter giving agency to physical objects, even more such questions could emerge – like what if the programmable parts of your car malfunctioned and caused a fatal accident? Who would be at fault? As the technology advances, we must continue to grapple with such ethical concerns. Robots have been producing things for us for some time now, but there’s one area that they’ve yet to infiltrate: houses. This is because houses are big, complicated structures with lots of different elements and possible locations to consider, and robots are better suited for precisely-controlled factory conditions. However, these obstacles may soon be a thing of the past. In China, the company WinSun has cleared the impressive hurdle of 3D printing houses. The company first prints the walls and other components layer by layer in its factory and then assembles them on site. But a group in the United States, led by Dr. Steven Keating, is using a different approach to 3D-printing in construction. Dr. Keating has built a truck that has a giant 3D-printing arm capable of rapidly creating a lightweight foam mold into which concrete can be poured. This allows for quick, customizable and inexpensive construction, along with all the sturdiness that comes with using concrete. But that’s not all; Dr. Keating went one step further and made a second, self-driving version of the truck. This means that autonomous construction machines could build structures in places considered too dangerous for human labor, whether at unstable disaster sites, underwater or even in space. While this raises the threat of putting humans out of work, the benefit of more affordable, sturdier and quicker construction methods may be too good to ignore. There’s no denying that some jobs will be lost to automated construction robots, but some specialists are already predicting that the real problem will be an increase in the wage gap, with computer-savvy engineers being paid even more, and the ground crew being paid even less. Nevertheless, this sort of 3D printing could solve the issue of housing solutions for refugees and millions of other impoverished people in slums or similar life-threatening situations. And for architects, there’s the aesthetic benefit of 3D printing and being able to design and build structures that are far too difficult or even impossible to build with today’s methods. So, not only will beautiful houses be affordable, they’ll also be like nothing we’ve ever seen before. Imagine walking through an actual forest with a virtual guide a few steps ahead of you, giving you the details of each type of tree you walk past. This is the kind of future that augmented reality or AR, will provide. Unlike virtual reality, which places you in a virtual world, AR adds layers of virtual elements onto the real world around you. One of the benefits AR technology could provide is efficiency. Take the Smart Helmet, for example, made by the company DAQRI. This AR device displays virtual layers on the helmet’s eye shield, which can make it a great tool for learning complex jobs in a safe, virtual environment. In a study involving the assembly of aircraft parts, practicing on the Smart Helmet made trainees 30 percent faster than before and reduced their normal error rate by a whopping 94 percent. AR is also being developed to assist in surgeries, construction and combat. Just like the internet, AR will put more information at our fingertips, so to speak, and make us more efficient because we won’t need to stop what we’re doing to search for that information. However, also like the internet, AR comes with issues regarding control and privacy. Pokémon GO is a good example of a game that leveraged the power of AR by taking your real surroundings and superimposing images of virtual characters for people to interact with. It was hugely popular, but was not without its problems: One issue was players finding Pokémon at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, prompting museum personnel to ask players to show some respect and turn off the game, which raised the question of who exactly is responsible for monitoring the AR world. But this technology poses bigger threats, some of which have already been raised by the 3D facial recognition software Recognizr. In theory, you could take Recognizr with you wherever you went and use it to instantly and secretly get information about the people around you without their consent. Obviously, this kind of technology, in the wrong hands, could cause all sorts of problems. In 2015 alone, malaria killed over half a million people, and efforts to eradicate the disease have remained unsuccessful. But there is hope that the growing field of synthetic biology, or advanced DNA manipulation, could finally give us the tools we need. Scientists can manipulate the DNA of mosquitoes with a gene that is resistant to malaria. Introduced into the larger population, it is believed this gene could quickly spread and wipe out the disease in any particular region. While this might sound like a miracle that should happen as soon as possible, scientists want to conduct more tests before releasing a synthetically engineered organism into the wild. Plus, mosquitoes are just the tip of the synthetic biology iceberg. Scientists are also looking into “humanizing” pig organs so that humans could have a large supply of any number of organs for medical transplants. And then there is the growing field of made-to-order organisms. Recently, scientists have discovered how to manipulate the bacterial immune system in such a way that allows them to cut DNA at a specific location, remove a piece from one organism’s DNA and add it to another’s. This technology is called CRISPR-Cas9, and it could enable us to do things like cut potential diseases out of human embryos or change the eye color or hair color of your future child. This may have you wondering, how close are we to purely synthetic life? So far, Dr. J. Craig Venter has created an organism named Syn 3.0 by replacing the natural genome of a bacteria with a laboratory-made, synthetic genome. While Syn 3.0 could be called a synthetic organism, it only has the most basic functions of life, like reproduction. But it comes with the possibility that we could program this simplified organism to do whatever would be most useful, such as cleaning up toxic spills or recycling waste. Of course, tampering with nature at the molecular level poses a variety of ethical concerns, many of which still need to be addressed. Despite the great progress made in modern medicine, thousands of patients still get misdiagnosed every day. In the future, however, we might be able to employ something known as precision medicine. In a world of precision medicine, you could walk into a clinic and get an instant diagnosis and prescription of the best possible treatment. The key to this system would be biomarkers or biological indicators that would immediately detect any unwanted molecules entering your bloodstream, cancerous growths or even symptoms relating to depression. While precision medicine, along with a community of doctors and scientists who are capable of analyzing this kind of data, is likely a long way from becoming a reality, there have already been some major advances. Since being able to recognize the appearance of new molecules is crucial to the development of biomarkers, the discovery of microRNA has marked a significant step in the right direction. While scientists are still coming to grips with the true nature and full implications of microRNA, it is believed that these tiny molecules, which are found in the human bloodstream, can indicate the presence of cancer and even tell us what stage the cancer is at. Now, aside from curing diseases, precision medicine could also introduce every patient to their own individual metabolome. This is the name of your unique system of molecules, including sugars and vitamins, which help your body function. It would allow patients to know which foods and activities are best for them, and which ones they should avoid in order to stay healthy. On top of all this, there’s also the possibility of behavioral biomarkers that could indicate the development of mental health problems. Dr. Christopher Danforth of the University of Vermont already believes there are signs we can pick up on that may signal a troubled mind. For example, in his research, Dr. Danforth has found that depressed people tend to post darker photos on Instagram than people with more positive outlooks. While the previously-discussed 3D printing of houses is undoubtedly impressive, you might be wondering how far this technology can really go. Well, one of its potential applications may offer some good news for the 8,000 people who wait in vain for an organ transplant every year: bioprinting. Bioprinting aims to let us print the organs that these people need. But, as you may expect, it’s an extremely complex procedure. Organs tend to be made up of a dozen or more types of cells. So, to print an organ, there needs to be a dozen or more kinds of bio-ink for the printer to replicate these various cells. Plus, depending on how the cells react with one another, the bio-ink will need to undergo any number of treatments, such as being heated up or exposed to UV radiation, all while being printed. Then there’s the challenge of printing quickly enough such that the cells don’t die before the transplant takes place! The biggest challenge of bioprinting so far has been figuring out how to recreate the tiny blood vessels that are vital to making organs work. Nevertheless, despite the many complexities it entails, substantial strides have been made in bioprinting. At Rice University, a team led by Dr. Jordan Miller has been trying to solve the blood vessel problem by using a gel to encase a dissolvable sugar that would then dissipate and help cells stick to the walls of the veins. While Dr. Miller’s work is still ongoing, he’s already been able to print some of the body’s thicker blood vessels. Meanwhile, companies like Organovo have used bioprinting to recreate human cells to test new pharmaceuticals on. This is a significant advance in removing human beings from the potentially deadly business of drug trials. In addition, the thin parts of the human body, such as the cartilage and heart valves, have already been successfully printed, and a group at Princeton University has even 3D printed a human ear. In sci-fi movies, we’ve seen characters plug things into their brain in order to quickly download life-saving information. However, the more we learn about the brain, the less likely it seems that we’ll ever be able to hook ourselves up to a thumb drive for a cranial download of the Encyclopedia Britannica. So instead, what scientists are focusing on these days is how to use brain-computer interfaces to fix problems, such as blindness and paralysis, rather than enhance abilities. One recent development has been electrocorticography, or ECoG, which has allowed paralyzed patients to control robot arms and move computer cursors solely through brain signals. Scientists have also figured out ways to repair and redirect neurological information and correct issues of blindness, deafness and even dementia. For example, a deaf patient can now receive a cochlear implant, which uses a small microphone to deliver sounds to a receiver in the patient’s skin. The receiver then translates the sound into electrical signals that are sent to the inner ear. The result has been described as sounding like a low-quality cassette tape recording, which is still far better than silence. Other enhancements are likely to arrive as we come to learn more about the brain. However, current methods for understanding and treating the brain are so invasive that they are usually reserved for extreme cases where all else has failed, such as suicidal patients or ones with constant seizures. One such procedure is called deep brain stimulation, and it uses a surgically implanted electrode that connects the brain to a battery under the skin. It sends high-frequency electricity to targeted areas in an effort to reduce neurologically induced symptoms, like seizures or the tics that accompany Tourette’s syndrome. Curiously, the results suggest that the high-frequency signals can also improve a patient’s memory of spatial information. Other studies suggest that less invasive techniques, like external magnetic stimulation, which places magnetic or electric fields over a patient’s head, might also improve memory and cognitive abilities. So far, the data has been inconclusive, but as with other scientific and medical breakthroughs, only time will tell. The key message in this book: Incredible research into future technologies is currently being conducted all over the world, yet it tends to fly under the radar of our usual news feed. By exploring the technologies of the future, we can think about what the future might look like and, more importantly, consider the ethical dilemmas that may be in store for humankind. Got feedback?

Or clicked on a cat video, only to have your computer paralyzed by malicious software? Cybercriminals are laughing all the way to the bank. Spam is a serious threat, and no one is safe. But who exactly are spammers, and how do they go about earning millions from sending endless streams of fake pharmaceutical advertisements and get-rich-quick schemes? These blinks will show you the dark corners of the internet where cybercriminals organize their activities and are always one step ahead of the law. Yes, anti-spammers are fighting back, but it’s still up to you to get savvy on how to spot a spammer and stay safe. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why you should never buy prescription drugs over the internet; why the government hit Google with a $500 million fine; and why you shouldn’t open random emails, even when it says it’s from the IRS.   This is a Blinkist staff pick “I love how these blinks put faces on the tons of evil emails that get stuck in your spam filter every day. As it turns out, much of the world’s spam and cybercrime can be traced to a handful of Russian hackers.” – Erik, Editorial Production Manager at Blinkist Try our miracle sex pill! Lose 30 pounds with this no-risk diet! Almost daily we’re inundated with spam emails, touting everything from hot dates to how-to-be-a-millionaire scams. It’s easy to laugh these emails off as harmless, if not annoying, marketing ploys. Yet spam is actually a huge industry and poses a serious threat to our safety online. What’s more, even if you never open a spam email or click on a flashy banner ad, the danger is still there. Spam emails often contain viruses and other malware (malicious software) that can infect your computer. In fact, the amount of malware spread via spam is staggering. Companies that produce antivirus solutions claim that they deal with some 82,000 new variants of malware through spam emails every day. During the first quarter of 2013 alone, McAfee, one of the world’s leading computer security companies, discovered some 14 million new malware viruses. Even worse, malicious software imbedded in spam can turn a computer into a hired gun for cybercrime. Fake ads for Viagra or penis enlargement pills are often set by criminals to snare a computer user, whose hardware is essentially hijacked and added to a sophisticated network of other hijacked computers called a botnet. A botnet can then be hired out to cybercriminals to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. During a DDoS attack, a website is bombarded with so much data that it becomes unavailable to users. Such attacks are often performed as part of an extortion scheme, in which a site or group of sites are kept offline until its owner pays a ransom. Sometimes DDoS attacks are even directed at governments, and the consequences can be dire. In 2008, the Estonian government was the target of a massive DDoS attack, and most government websites were down for days. Many of the country’s online banking services went briefly offline, and the national network used for medical emergencies was likewise disrupted. The spam industry is a highly efficient and profitable machine, run by only a handful of experienced cybercriminals, often with a background in other criminal activities. So who are these people and how do they operate? Among the most important players in the spam world is a man named Pavel Vrublevsky, also known as “Red Eye.” Vrublevsky made a name for himself early on from his profitable network of hard-core porn sites that specialized in depicting scenes of rape, bestiality, incest and other violent material. He also cofounded a spammers’ online forum called Crutop.nu, where members can share trade secrets. “Red Eye” is also the man behind ChronoPay, a payment service that has processed transactions for various cybercrime schemes. Among other rackets, ChronoPay secured payment processing for networks that peddled fake anti-virus software. After Vrublevsky was arrested in 2011, however, these networks fell apart practically overnight. According to computer security company McAfee, their disappearance resulted in a 60-percent drop in reported problems regarding fake anti-virus software. Ironically, Vrublevsky’s career in facilitating cybercrime ran parallel to his tenure as the chairman of an anti-spam initiative spearheaded by the Russian Ministry of Telecommunications. In the early 2000s, a few major players in the spam industry entered partnerships, or partnerkas, which matched spammers with businesses interested in selling illegal products and services. These partnerships have helped spammers to create stable and profitable networks. The partnerkas are involved in several aspects of online scams, taking care of setting up web servers, creating web content, coordinating suppliers and offering customer service. One major partnerka was Rx-Promotion, a venture founded by Vrublevsky and Yuri “Hellman” Kabayenkov, established to set up illegal online pharmacies. The amount of spam in daily circulation is mind-boggling. However, this flood can be traced back to just a small gang of dedicated spammers. Armed with huge networks of hacked computers, these few cybercriminals provide the firepower of the spam industry. But who exactly are these spammers? One major player is a Russian named Dmitri Nechvolod, also know as “Gugle,” who was behind the Cutwail botnet – one of the largest and most damaging botnets of all time. In 2008, the Cutwail botnet infected more than 125,000 computers and was capable of pumping out 16 billion spam messages per day. To put this in perspective, the total number of spam messages sent daily worldwide in 2013 was estimated to be about 85 billion. As the Cutwail botnet grew, Nechvolod began hiring other programmers, luring them away from legitimate businesses into a life of cybercrime. According to business partner Igor Vishnevsky, Nechvolod lived a life of luxury. So lavish, in fact, that when he wrecked his $100,000 Lexus, he simply went out and bought a new BMW. Another spam kingpin uses the nickname “Cosma.” This is the man behind the Rustock botnet created in 2006, which in one short year infected approximately 150,000 computers. At its peak, the Rustock botnet could fire off about 30 billion spam messages per day, and it made Cosma rich. Leaked information from ChronoPay shows that in 2010, Cosma received $200,000 in commission, just for his work promoting pharmacy websites for Rx-Promotion. And that was only one of many partnerkas that Cosma was involved in at the time. If you suffer from a serious disease, managing expensive medications can add to the stress. Yet imagine the relief you might feel if one day, you received an email offering you a version of your medication for a fraction of the original cost. Wouldn’t you be tempted to accept the offer? If so, you’re certainly not alone. In the United States and in other countries, prescription drugs can be expensive; and for the uninsured, shouldering out-of-pocket costs for necessary medication can be almost impossible. At their peak, online “rogue” pharmacies sold prescription medicines to hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide. Take the example of Craig S., a former life-insurance salesman who, when his employer pulled him off his health care plan, decided to buy a generic version of his medication from an online pharmacy. While pills from a regular pharmacy would have cost Craig $212 per month, the online provider offered him the generic equivalent for $178 dollars for a three months’ supply. Such “rogue” pharmacies quickly developed into serious businesses with quality customer support and generous return policies. Researchers at the University of California in San Diego found that some 38 percent of revenue for SpamIt, a pharma partnerka run by Pavel Vrublevsky’s nemesis Igor Gusev, came from returning customers. Evidently, “rogue” pharma was giving legit pharma a run for its money. However, not all of these pharmacies were on the level. While many served customers well, others sold fake pills, even poisonous ones. For example, in 2006 Marcia Bergeron died as a result of poison that was mixed into the medications she had bought from a rogue pharmacy. An autopsy revealed that she had been slowly poisoned by metals in the pills (which also contained uranium, a radioactive substance) that were used in place of other non-active ingredients. As the rogue pharma business grew, spam kingpins Igor Gusev and Pavel Vrublevsky became richer. Yet their growing wealth and power was accompanied by paranoia and distrust. Very soon the two spammers began to loathe one another, eventually leading to a serious fallout. The feud between Gusev and Vrublevsky, now known as the Pharma Wars, was as vicious as it was costly. As Gusev, the man behind the spam pharma partnerkas GlavMed and SpamIt, was vacationing in Spain in 2008, he received troubling messages from a hacker friend back in Russia. His friend had run into one of Vrublevsky’s business partners, who, while drunk, had boasted of initiating a criminal investigation against Gusev with the aim of putting him behind bars. Gusev retaliated in a big way. Chat records from 2010 reveal that he spent over $400,000 bribing law enforcement officials to both protect himself and convince police to go after Vrublevsky. His money ended up being well spent, as Vrublevsky was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. But Gusev couldn’t hide his criminal activities forever. Under pressure from the law, he was eventually forced to close down SpamIt and flee the country. As some top spammers tell it, this bitter feud was ruinous for the spam industry. Not only did the Pharma Wars cost spammers and partnerkas lots of money, but it also attracted the attention of politicians and law enforcement agencies, forcing spammers to abandon their profitable businesses in search of new turf. In the spam wars, there are good guys and bad guys. The good guys are anti-spam activists, or “antis,” who work to curb cybercriminals and their activities – often at risk to themselves personally. Anti-spam start-up Blue Security came up with ingenious ways to shut down spammers, but their campaign came at a high price. The company developed software called Blue Frog, which when used, would protect a user from spam by sending a request email back to the email sender’s network. The request was a simple one: Please don’t send any more junk email. Blue Security noticed however that many of these messages were simply ignored, so they devised a new scheme. Instead of receiving a request from a single user, a spammer’s inbox would be flooded with requests from all of Blue Security’s 522,000 users simultaneously, creating such heavy traffic that a spammer would effectively have his email system shut down. The spammers retaliated in a more criminal fashion. One of Blue Security’s founders was anonymously sent pictures of his children on the playground – a clear threat. Under this kind of pressure, the start-up’s main investor pulled out, and the company shut down. One of the difficulties in fighting spammers is that they often join forces to attack those who get in their way. In 2013, a non-profit focused on tracking spammers called Spamhaus suffered what some experts have called the largest concerted cyberattack in the history of the internet. A group of cybercriminals bombarded the Spamhaus website with over 300 billion bits of data per second for over 90 days. The data didn’t just affect Spamhaus, however; hundreds of millions of internet users also experienced delays and error messages. Sven Olaf Kamphuis, a 35-year-old man from Holland, was later arrested in Spain for his involvement in coordinating the attack. While we might expect the government to coordinate the fight against spam and cybercrime, private companies also have an important role to play. Some are even leading successful efforts. Credit card companies, for example, have made serious changes to general protocols as a means of protecting themselves and their customers against cybercrime. In 2012, Visa introduced changes to their regulations regarding the sale of pharmaceutical-related products. These sales are now considered “high risk,” and issuing new contracts for payment processing to a high-risk company requires a higher standard of due diligence. Among other things, companies that sell pharmaceutical-related products are required to have $100 million in equity and a good risk-management score. In addition to making the barrier for entry harder for illicit businesses, companies that aid illegal activity online now face punishment. The domain registrar EstDomains, which for many years had been a favorite among spammers and online scammers, had its accreditation revoked in 2008 after a story in The Washington Post revealed that CEO Vladimir Tsastsin had previously been convicted of credit card fraud and money laundering. As a result, many other registrars that previously had not considered it necessary to track how customers used their domains have now begun to screen potential customers. And in 2011, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Google had agreed to pay a $500 million fine to settle an ongoing criminal investigation, which alleged that the online giant had allowed rogue pharmacies to advertise their products in the American market. The enormous size of the fine was meant to represent the profit Google had made from hosting the ads. Spammers and their kin always seem one step ahead of the law. To be sure, cybercriminals never rest, and no one is safe. The efforts of companies like Microsoft and various law enforcement agencies have made it much more difficult for cybercrime partnerships to access credit card processing through payment services such as ChronoPay. These tighter regulations have effectively killed the fake anti-virus software industry. Yet in this void, a new threat has emerged: ransomware. In a ransomware scheme, victims receive emails or pop-up messages that appear as if they’re from the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The messages claim that the user has committed a crime, such as downloading pirated content or child pornography, and that they must pay a fine to avoid prosecution. Usually, victims are instructed to pay the fine using a prepaid debit card or cash voucher, to make it harder to trace the money. At the same time, the victim’s computer is locked down and infected with software that encrypts all the files on the computer, denying the user access until he pays or manages to remove the virus. Botnets too are much more malicious than they were in the past. The Rustock botnet, which was one of the most active pharmacy site promoters during the height of the Pharma Wars, now spreads malware designed to harvest passwords or other sensitive information. These spam messages take many forms, such as fake FedEx messages or Internal Revenue Service audits. They target small and midsized companies, hoping to grab usernames and passwords from company employees in charge of financial transactions. Armed with this information, cybercriminals can either make payments to their own accounts or sell the information to other cybercriminals. The key message in this book: Those spam emails in your inbox are far more than a nuisance. In fact, they’re part of an industry run by a few powerful cybercriminals and represent a direct threat to everyone, even if you’ve never opened a single spam email.  Actionable advice: Nothing is more precious than your password. Too many people are lazy when it comes to creating good passwords. You should strive to make your passwords as difficult to crack as possible. Ensure your password is over ten characters if possible, and combine both numbers, letters and special characters.

That might sound dramatic, but consider the iPhone when it debuted. It didn’t just move a lot of units; it fundamentally changed the way we interact with our mobile devices, integrating them into our everyday lives in many different ways. In other words, it transformed our behavior.  That’s why behavioral modification should be at the forefront of our minds when we approach the task of designing new products and services. Instead of just thinking about how we can sell stuff, we should take a step back and ask ourselves, what’s the behavior we’re trying to promote? Or to put it a little more poetically, what kind of reality are we trying to create?  From there, we can work backward in designing new products and services. That’s what Starting at the End is all about. Drawing on behavioral science, these blinks offer a systematic approach to product and service design. In these blinks, you’ll learn  how to sum up your vision of a new reality into a single, powerful statement;  how to create a map of the influences on your potential customers’ behavior; and  how to use that map to modify those influences and thereby transform the world.  The process of assessing how we can modify our potential consumers’ behavior is called the Intervention Design Process, or IDP. It begins with a special type of observation called a potential insight. When you have one of these insights, you’re perceiving a gap between the world as it is (the real world) and the world as you want it to be (the ideal world).  To make this somewhat abstract definition more concrete, let’s dig into an example. Back in 2012, when the author was helping Microsoft develop the search engine Bing, he and his team had a potential insight: it seemed like children weren’t using search engines at school anywhere near as much as one might expect.  At first glance, children, schools and search engines should have been a perfect combination. After all, children are brimming with questions, schools are supposed to foster their curiosity and search engines can help them answer nearly any question they might have. In an ideal world (at least from Bing’s perspective), they would be conducting numerous online searches per day (preferably on Bing, of course). But the team suspected a gap between the real world and the ideal world; something was driving a wedge between the two.  Now, the keyword here is “suspected.” At this point, no one at Microsoft had any empirical evidence to support the notion in question; it was just a hunch. That’s why it was a potential insight; it hadn’t yet been confirmed as an actual insight.  For all anyone at Microsoft knew at the time, their hunch could have been wrong, and the gap they were perceiving could have been a figment of their imagination. In that case, it would have been a waste of time, money and energy for the company to throw resources at solving a problem that didn’t exist. That’s true of any potential insight, so it’s crucial to test your insight.  To do that, you need to seek out quantitative or qualitative validation of your insight. For the author and his team, that meant collecting data about children’s internet usage at school – an example of quantitative validation. It also meant going to schools and watching kids’ computer usage in person – an example of qualitative validation.  It turned out their hunch was correct: on average, each student was conducting less than one search per day. The gap between the ideal world and the real world was proven to exist; their insight was validated. If the same can be said of your insight, you can now proceed to the next step of the IDP.  So far, you’ve identified the gap between the world as it is and the world as you’d like it to be. Your next step is to write up a formal description of the ideal world you want to create.  This is called a behavioral statement, and it can be broken into five components. The first is the behavior you’re trying to promote. Usually, it boils down to purchasing and using your product or service. For example, when Uber launched its ride-sharing service in 2009, the behavior the company wanted to promote was, well, taking an Uber.  The second component is the population whose behavior you want to change. Sometimes, that population can be very broad. Uber’s target population was everyone. Usually, however, your target population will be a narrower demographic, such as a particular age group.  The third component is the motivation behind the behavior you’re trying to encourage. For Uber, that was simply the desire to get from point A to point B. In the company’s ideal world, any time anyone wanted to do this, they’d take an Uber.  But when thinking about your ideal world, you have to be realistic. Even within your target population, your product or service usually won’t be usable or desirable for people in every situation. There are certain limitations, or preconditions, on when and how people can use it. These are the fourth component of your behavioral statement. Here, you’re noting the preconditions that need to be met for people to engage in the behavior you want to promote. For example, to take an Uber at the time of the company’s launch, people needed to have a smartphone equipped with a mobile internet connection and an electronic form of payment. They also needed to live in San Francisco, because the company limited its initial rollout to the high-tech city in which it was based.  In the fifth and final component of the behavioral statement, you define the data by which you will measure whether or not the behavior you want to promote is taking place. For Uber, the metric was pretty simple: the number of rides people took with their service.  Now all that’s left to do is to take those five components and fuse them into a single sentence. For Uber, that would be as follows: “When people want to get from Point A to Point B, and they have a smartphone with connectivity and an electronic form of payment and live in San Francisco, they will take an Uber (as measured by rides).”  Thanks to your behavioral statement, you now have a precise description of the ideal world you’re trying to create. The next step is to start figuring out how to make it a reality!  Here, we begin with two basic premises. First, there must be certain factors holding people back from engaging in the behavior in which we want them to engage; these are inhibiting pressures. Second, there must be certain factors encouraging people who are engaging in the behavior; these are promoting pressures.  Your task now is to identify these pressures – a process called pressure mapping. Let’s illustrate how to do this with a rather mouth-watering example: M&Ms.  Imagine you’re working for Mars, the company that makes M&Ms, and your goal is to encourage the behavior of eating the chocolate candy. What are the promoting pressures for this behavior? Well, to start with the obvious, M&Ms are tasty. They’re also visually attractive, coming in an array of vivid colors.  These colors provide an example of irrational promoting pressures. They don’t actually affect the taste or nutritional content of M&Ms; the colors are completely superficial. A completely logical, M&M-chomping android couldn’t care less about them. Nonetheless, such irrational pressures can be very powerful. Just imagine what would happen to M&M sales if you changed their colors from cheerful shades like red and green to shades that reminded people of vomit and urine!  Now let’s turn to the inhibiting pressures. Here’s a big one: availability. The harder the M&Ms are to get, the less likely people are to eat them. Imagine you had a bowl of M&Ms right next to you, right now. You’d probably be pretty tempted to grab a handful of them. Now imagine they’re 20 feet away from you in a cabinet, then 20 meters away in a vending machine and then 20 blocks away in a convenience store. Notice how the temptation gets weaker and weaker?  Now, there’s one obvious pressure we haven’t talked about so far: calories and sugar content. Those are another inhibiting pressure, right? Well, as you’ll learn in the next blink, the matter is a bit more complicated than that, and it illustrates why pressure mapping is a little trickier than it might seem at first glance.  If you’re conscious about your health, the high calories and sugar content of a pack of M&Ms are probably going to be a pretty significant inhibiting pressure, dissuading you from eating them. But if you’re feeling hungry or experiencing a blood sugar crash, they could also be a promoting pressure, tempting you to gobble them down.  Here we encounter an example of a counter-rational pressure – a pressure that can go in either direction, contrary to what a rational observer might expect. These counter-rational pressures are context-dependent. For example, M&Ms have a playful, lighthearted branding that features anthropomorphic candy characters. In the context of a kid’s party, that branding is a promoting pressure – but at a romantic dinner, it would probably make them feel pretty out of place; their branding would then become an inhibiting pressure.  The more you analyze them, the more you realize that all pressures are context-dependent. For example, take something seemingly as cut-and-dried as the cost of M&Ms. At a couple bucks per pack, they might seem pretty cheap to you – another promoting pressure. But imagine you’re a six-year-old boy who needs to save up his allowance for a week to buy one. Or imagine you’re one of the majority of people on Earth who lives on less than $2.50 per day. Now they’re expensive – an inhibiting pressure.  Well, sometimes. Expensiveness can also be a counter-rational promoting pressure. For example, the high cost of jewelry is a part of its appeal; the expense conveys quality, status and a sense of luxury. Point being: promoting and inhibiting pressures are complicated. They shift with context, and they can often be either counter-rational or outright irrational.  That’s why we shouldn’t rely on our intuitions or preconceptions when we’re trying to identify and map out those pressures. The reality of them may be different than our perceptions or assumptions – and there may be pressures we haven’t even considered. To do pressure mapping well, you need to base it on empirical research and validate it with evidence – collecting data, conducting interviews and so forth.  But here’s the good news: if you did a solid job with the insight-validation phase of the IDP, you’ll already have plenty of evidence on which to draw when you reach the pressure-mapping stage.  Let’s say you’ve finished mapping out your target behavior’s inhibiting and promoting pressures. On a whiteboard, you may have drawn a picture of the behavior in the middle, surrounded by downward arrows for each of the inhibiting pressures and upward arrows for each of the promoting pressures.  You can now see at a glance the balance of forces surrounding the behavior. The more the promoting pressures outweigh the inhibiting pressures, the more likely people will be to engage in the behavior. Conversely, the more strongly the inhibiting pressures push down against the promoting pressures, the less likely people will be to engage in the behavior.  For example, when the author was working with the Clover Health insurance company, he and his team had an insight: people in the black community were getting flu shots at a much lower rate than the general population. After validating this insight, coming up with a behavioral statement and doing some research, they mapped out a number of promoting pressures and inhibiting pressures.  One of the main promoting pressures was the idea that a flu shot is good for your health. This turned out to be fairly weak among black people in the United States; many of them responded to it by asking, “Why do I need a shot? I’m already healthy.”  Meanwhile, on the other side of the equation, there were several strong inhibiting pressures. For example, many black people were bothered by the fact that the formula for the flu shot was changed every year.  Health care providers do this for a good reason; it helps to keep the flu shot effective. But for some black people, it might seem like there’s some sort of medical experimentation going on. That taps into some very real and very painful history, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Conducted by US government researchers from 1932 to 1972, this study involved denying antibiotic treatments to black research subjects, killing many of them in the process.  Understandably, then, there was a whole lot of distrust coming from multiple directions at once. The strength of these inhibiting pressures was overpowering the weaker promoting pressures, resulting in a low rate of black people getting flu shots.  By understanding the pressures behind this phenomenon, the author and his team were now in a position to start thinking about how to change it, which brings us to the next step of the IDP.  At this point in the IDP, you’ve mapped out the inhibiting and promoting pressures that surround your target behavior. As a result, you now know the balance of power between the two sides.  To promote your target behavior, you need to alter that balance of power to make it more favorable to the reality you want to create. You can’t directly force people to engage in the behavior in which you want them to engage – but you can indirectly nudge them in one direction or another by manipulating the pressures that surround them.  There are two basic ways of doing this: decreasing the inhibiting pressures or increasing the promoting pressures. Either way, you’ll need to take some sort of action to accomplish these objectives. By taking that action, you’re making an intervention into the existing reality. So your task now becomes a matter of coming up with ideas for possible interventions.  To illustrate these ideas, let’s return to the example of the author’s work with Clover Health. Remember, many members of the black community were unconvinced of the health benefits of flu shots (a weak promoting pressure), as well as being concerned about their resemblance to medical experimentation (some strong inhibiting pressures).  The author and his team came up with 20 possible interventions. That’s a pretty typical number at this stage of the IDP. It’s also way too many ideas to test, so now the task was to narrow them down to a more feasible number, like five.  One way to do this is to combine as many interventions together as possible. For example, the author and his team reasoned that the black community’s skepticism and concerns about the flu shot all involved a feeling of distrust in one way or another. They knew that for many members of the community, their most trusted sources of guidance were the leaders of their churches. So the team had an idea for a possible intervention: reach out to those leaders and convince them to talk to their congregations about the benefits of the flu shot and to reassure them, thus intervening in multiple pressures at once.  Those are the sort of win-win, combinatory solutions you’re looking for at this stage of the IDP. Once you’ve identified a handful of them, you’ll be ready for the next step.  Now that you’ve come up with some possible interventions to promote your target behavior, you’re probably going to be feeling pretty eager to go out into the field and put your ideas into action.  But hold on – before you move forward, you need to hit the pause button and conduct an ethical check. After all, what you’re setting out to do is to influence people’s behavior. Now, that can be a good thing; just think of anti-smoking campaigns. But it can also be a very bad thing, like the ads that glamorized smoking in the first place. To conduct an ethical test, here’s the first question to ask: What is the behavior you’re trying to promote and does it match the goals and motivations of the population to whom you’re trying to promote it? If it doesn’t match their goals and motivations, then it would be unethical to move forward with your interventions. For example, if you were a tobacco company using advertising to convince people to smoke, you’d be trying to manipulate them into doing something that’s contrary to their paramount goal in life: staying alive.  Now, you could try to get around this problem by making the following argument: “Sure, no one wants to be unhealthy or dead – but lots of people want to look cool, and they think that smoking helps them accomplish that objective. So in this respect, the behavior does match their goals and motivations. We’re just giving people what they want.”  This brings us to our second ethical question: Do the benefits of the behavior outweigh the costs? Even if we grant that “looking cool” is a benefit, surely it’s outweighed by the cost of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease that comes with smoking, so promoting this behavior remains unethical.  If you wanted to, though, you could wiggle out of this ethical corner. Just write up a whole list of supposed benefits that come with smoking, and then cherry-pick or maybe even fund some studies that downplay the costs.  To counteract this possibility, we can add a third ethical question to the mix: Are you being transparent about your motivations and research methods? If you need to be sneaky to make the benefits look like they outweigh the costs, it’s a sign that you’re being unethical.  Let’s say you’ve done an honest ethical check and you’ve confirmed that your target behavior matches your target population’s goals and motivations, that the benefits of the behavior outweigh the costs and that you’ve been transparent in making this determination. All’s well and good; now you can move forward with your interventions, right? Well, not so fast. It’s not just your target behavior that you need to check; it’s also the interventions themselves. Remember the old caveat: the ends do not justify the means. Even if your target behavior is totally laudable, that doesn’t necessarily mean your interventions are ethical. For example, you could try to convince people to get a flu shot by sending them scare letters telling them they will die if they don’t get one, but that would be a pretty unethical intervention.  To conduct an ethical check of your possible interventions, you just need to ask the same questions about them as you did with your target behavior. For example, would an untruthful scare letter be in sync with people’s goals and motivations, and would the benefits outweigh the costs? No – people don’t want to be lied to or scared unnecessarily, and the emotional cost of the anxiety that might result from the letter could arguably outweigh the benefit of convincing more people to get flu shots.  Of course, if you wanted to, you could manipulate your appraisal of the scare letter to make it look like the benefits outweighed the costs. That’s why you also need to be transparent about your methods and motivations when conducting an ethical check of your possible interventions. The same rule of thumb applies here as the one you had with your target behavior: if you need to be devious to make the benefits look like they outweigh the costs, then it’s a sign you’re being unethical.  So there you have it; that’s the ethical check. Assuming both your target behavior and your possible interventions have passed it, you’re now ready for the last step of the IDP, where you’re finally going to start testing out your ideas.  When you reach the final step of the IDP, you enter it with a handful of possible interventions that you think might foster the behavior you want to promote. Now it’s time for the rubber to hit the road and see if they work.  But you don’t want to spin your wheels too fast here. In theory, you could take one of your possible interventions and roll it out right away on a nationwide or even international scale. But what if it doesn’t work? That’s a lot of wasted time, energy and money. Plus, what about the other four possible interventions you might have come up with? You probably don’t have the resources to try out all of them on a large scale. But if you don’t test them all, you’ll never know which one is the most effective.  To get around this problem, you need to start out much smaller, with a series of pilot studies, or pilots for short. With each pilot, you’re testing out your intervention with a very small sample size of your target population – and you’re doing that in an operationally dirty manner. That means you aren’t trying to implement the intervention in the most efficient way possible – a way that would scale-up well. Instead, you’re just trying to test the intervention with as little disruption to your organization as possible.  For example, in a fully operational, scaled-up version of your intervention, it might be much more efficient to use an automated computer system to take care of a task. But that could be a pain in the neck to develop, and it might be a lot of work for nothing if the intervention proves to be a nonstarter. So it would be better to do the job manually at this stage. Remember: you can always develop the fancy computer system later on if you discover the intervention is a winner and you want to scale it up.  The whole point of the pilots is to see if the interventions work, so the question now becomes, How do you show that? Well, if you’ve caught the drift of these blinks so far, you’ll already know the answer: look at the data. But there’s an important caveat to add to this answer, which we’ll look at in the next and final blink.  Assuming you’ve collected data for one of your pilot studies, you and your team now have some sense of whether or not the intervention you’re looking at is a promising one. Your sample size will have been pretty small, so you can’t be very certain of your results at this stage. But with at least some degree of certainty, you can now make a statement like, “this intervention seems to increase people’s engagement in our target behavior by 20 percent.”  In scientific parlance, the degree to which you’re certain about a statement like this is called your data’s p-value. Counterintuitively, the lower the value, the higher the certainty. If your p-value is 0.05, that means there’s a 5-percent chance your data are wrong and therefore a 95-percent chance they’re right.  In academia, scientists normally look for a p-value of less than 0.05 to feel enough trust in their data. But you’re designing products and services, not doing hallowed research in the ivory tower, so you can afford a greater degree of uncertainty. A p-value of less than 0.20 should do. Remember, that means there’s still an 80-percent chance your data are correct, and those aren’t bad odds to bet on in the real world.  Once you’ve finished piloting all your possible interventions and figured out which ones show promising results and pass under the 0.20 p-value hurdle, it’s time to conduct a more formal test for each of them. Here, you’re going to try out your intervention with a larger sample size to make sure the pilot data wasn’t just a fluke.  When you conduct the test, you’re also going to try implementing it in a way that’s much more operationally clean than your pilot. For example, remember that automated computer system you eschewed at the pilot stage? Well, now would be a good time to start developing it – because you want to test not just the effects of the intervention, but also the overall feasibility of it. Even if the results are fantastic, they might be too costly or cumbersome to achieve. You want to figure that out now before you decide you want to scale up and fully implement your intervention.  That decision is the final step of the IDP. To make it, you need to engage in some good ol’ fashioned cost-benefit analysis. Looking at the data for the possible interventions, which ones have positive results – and out of those interventions, which are most worth pursuing, once you factor in the costs? Those are the ones you want to scale and implement.  If all goes well, the rest will be history.  The key message in these blinks: The Intervention Design Process is a step-by-step approach to the design of products and services that begins with the behavior you want to promote and then works backward to make that behavior a reality. First, achieve an insight into the gap between the way you want people to behave (your ideal world) and the way they’re actually behaving (the real world). Then write up a behavioral statement formally describing that ideal world. Next, map out the promoting and inhibiting pressures that are preventing that world from coming into being. Then you can start thinking about possible interventions to modify those pressures. Once those interventions have passed an ethical check, you can start trialing them. By the end of this process, you will find one or more interventions that can be scaled up and implemented.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Smith and Rahul Telang","summary":"In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy after dominating the film and photographic industry for most of the twentieth century. The former corporate behemoth had failed to adapt to the new digital photography trend. Although Kodak had been aware of the seismic shift and even developed their own digital photography technology, they were afraid of cannibalizing their successful analog film business. As a result, they never gained a footing in the new market and quickly dwindled. There were no more Kodak moments. The moral of this story is that failing to adapt to new technology can be dangerous. During the last decade, many major players in the entertainment industry have failed to heed this warning. And many have seen themselves outrun by tech-savvy startups. So, how have these new companies managed to wrestle power away from the big players? These blinks explain. In these blinks, you’ll learn what six major music executives called “shit” in 1997; why over half a million people binge-watched the first season of House of Cards; and what piracy did to the Indian movie industry. A while ago, CDs were widely used to play music. Nowadays, you rarely see them, save for a small minority who collect them for nostalgic purposes. What led to their demise? Big players in the music industry ignored the potential of digital music, which allowed companies such as Apple, Pandora and Spotify to emerge and kill off the CD. In 2003, AT&T was the first company to attempt to introduce digital downloads with its division A2B Music. Its cofounders pitched the concept to top music executives but they were met with ridicule, as growing CD sales were creating so much revenue. A2B Music quickly dissolved, but in the early 2000s, companies like Apple began to flourish using the same technology. Soon, digital music became popular, and CDs became irrelevant. Encyclopedia Britannica suffered a similar fate. In 1985, Microsoft requested non-exclusive rights to the company so they could digitize the contents of its encyclopedias. Personal computers were growing in popularity at this time, but the print-based business wasn’t convinced. The repercussions of this decision would be felt in 1993; that year, Microsoft created a multimedia encyclopedia called Encarta, and sales of print encyclopedias plummeted by $110 million as a result. A modern-day company which harnesses the power of technology, is Netflix. It uses data analytics to truly customize the user experience. Formerly, production companies created pilot episodes of new shows and aired them to network executives. If the pilot received a positive response, the network requested more episodes – if not, the show was rejected. When the creators of House of Cards pitched their show to Netflix, the company ordered two seasons for $100 million without seeing the pilot. The Netflix team had thoroughly analyzed their user data and knew House of Cards would be a hit with their audience. The show’s creators were further incentivized to exclusively release both seasons on Netflix because, as a digital platform, it didn’t have the same airtime limitations as TV networks. In the past, only a few companies had the money to create content and facilitate new artists. If you were a creative, your vision was determined by the entity in control of the budget. However, newbies like Netflix have given artists and directors free rein. The first episode of House of Cards illustrates this. The show begins with an injured dog being strangled to death. Before, the scene wouldn’t have made it past network executives fearful that risky content could result in the loss of advertising money. Netflix doesn’t feature ads at all, so the show’s creators had greater liberty. Showrunner Beau Willimon didn’t have to split the series into 30- or 60-minute slots with cliffhangers in each episode either. Instead, he was able to write the show as if it were a 13-hour film. Viewers also benefit from the way Netflix operates as they can binge-watch at any time of the day. The company doesn’t restrict its consumers to watching episodes at specific times – 670,000 people binge-watched the entire second season of House of Cards! This is similar to how YouTube works – you can watch videos about any topic, and you can access them whenever you like. Artists also benefit because expensive equipment is no longer necessary. The Academy Award-winning documentary The Lady in Number 6 was shot using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, which cost only a few thousand dollars – a lot less than a traditional movie camera. Companies like YouTube directly try to help artists save money on production. The platform offers  YouTube Spaces to those of its users with over 5,000 subscribers. These facilities provide access to editing, makeup, lights, design, videography and equipment. The entertainment business is constantly changing, so the real challenge for industry leaders is to perceive these shifts at the right time, understand their scale and respond effectively. The story of Thomas Edison and his musical invention is a prime example of a businessman failing to comprehend an evolving market. In 1877, he created the phonograph – a machine that could record sound onto a tinfoil-covered cylinder. He patented his invention and moved on to developing the electric light bulb. However, others continued to modify his idea until the graphophone came into existence; this was a far superior device which used wax cylinders to record sound. A rich businessman bought the rights to both the graphophone and the phonograph, but his company eventually went bankrupt. Edison bought back the rights to his machine and planned to develop it for jukeboxes in amusement parks. Later, in 1887, Emile Berliner patented sound recording on discs called records. They were easy to mass produce and store, so his business quickly proved to be extremely lucrative. Unfortunately for Edison, he chose to stick with his cylinders, while Berliner’s records dominated the music industry. In contrast to Edison, small indie labels of the 1950s judged their market correctly and benefitted from the emergence of rock ‘n’ roll. The big music companies saw rock and roll as a fad, or a niche interest for teenagers who didn’t have much purchasing power. Influencers of the period like Time magazine and Frank Sinatra also openly ridiculed the genre.   However, Alan Freed, a prominent disc jockey of the era, championed rock and roll and predicted its widespread popularity. As independent labels had nothing to lose, they collectively embraced the genre. A decade later, 42 labels had rock ‘n’ roll records in the charts. Today, the entertainment industry is more diverse – small companies exist alongside bigger businesses and still have a broad reach. However, this wasn’t always the case. Throughout the twentieth century, a handful of companies used their economic power and size to dominate the industry. During the 1950s, radio was essential to the music scene. In exchange for airtime for their artists, big labels would promise radio stations perks like backstage access, free concert tickets and various freebies. Smaller labels didn’t have the ability to do this. Similarly, the movie industry was presided over by six businesses: Disney, Fox, NBC, Paramount, Sony and Warner Brothers. Together, they controlled 80 percent of the market because they operated on such a large scale. In the publishing field, the book trade was controlled in much the same way by Penguin, Random House, Macmillan, Harpercollins, Hachette and Simon and Schuster. Money facilitated this domination. Major players like Universal Music had the capital to take a risk on a range of artists, as one lucrative musician could make up for multiple failures. Financial strength also attracted top talent. A gifted artist was easily tempted away from working with an independent label when offered a sizable contract. In turn, labels associated with successful artists naturally enticed fresh talent. Before the internet, leading labels were also able to control the distribution of music because they could ensure maximum visibility for their artists by paying physical stores. In the 1990s, most outlets only carried around 3,000 to 5,000 albums – even the largest superstores held a maximum of 15,000. To promote their talent, these labels offered in-store interviews and advance album copies. Altogether, these advantages led big labels to perceive themselves as invincible. To their detriment, they failed to consider that technological advances could diminish their hold over the industry. There’s a limited edition vinyl that was pressed in the 1980s that you’re desperate to add to your collection. In the age prior to the internet, you’d have to put in considerable hours to source such rare or less popular titles. Now, of course, it’s much easier to both access and download records, books and other works online. In fact, it seems that the more obscure, the better. Unconventional artists tend to attract large, loyal audiences, and people are willing to pay small fortunes for rare titles. One of the authors of Streaming, Sharing, Stealing was prepared to do this while on the hunt for a 30-year-old pharmaceutical book. He was struggling to locate the book in a physical store, but by doing a quick search on Alibris – an online store for new, old and out-of-print titles – he was able to track down a copy. The book was his for $20, though he’d have been willing to pay more. When it arrived, $0.75 was written inside the front cover; the book had been sitting in a bookshop for years without attracting a single customer. So online stores provide an easier method of searching and more variety than offline establishments. To test this theory, the brains behind Streaming, Sharing, Stealing teamed up with researchers Alejandro Zentner and Cuneyd Kaya to study data from both the physical and online stores of a large video rental chain. They discovered that rentals of the 100 most popular DVDs made up 85 percent of transactions in-store but only 35 percent of online transactions. But did the online customers tend to go for obscure titles because they were shopping online rather than in a physical store? To ascertain this, the group looked at how an individual’s consumption pattern shifted when one of the chain’s local stores closed. The consumer was forced to switch from the limited in-store selection to the extensive online array. They found that this person was then more likely to rent unconventional titles over blockbusters. For a while, companies relied on good old intuition to determine which content would appeal to certain audiences. However, it’s since been discovered that companies which utilize their customer data make better creative decisions. By making use of big data, a company can bolster its marketing efforts. The app-based company Shazam is a prime example of this. The business works by allowing users to identify any track they hear. As it performs millions of searches each day, it’s built a competitive advantage by documenting all of this information. Due to the predictive power of Shazam’s data, it’s proven highly popular with many music agents. In February 2014, the company announced that it would be using its data to produce music for a new Warner Music Group imprint. User data also proved to be exceptionally useful when it came to promoting House of Cards. In order to target different customers, separate trailers were produced which utilized information collected about the show’s viewers. Visuals were created which focused on Kevin Spacey, aiming to appeal to those who had watched the actor’s other work. Similarly, trailers featuring David Fincher’s directing style were made to cater to those familiar with his aesthetic. The decision to use data-driven processes to create content has resulted in more recognition for online platforms, as well as numerous award wins. As a company, Amazon relies on data-driven processes to inform its creative decisions. At the 2015 Golden Globe Awards, it was up against networks such as HBO and The CW but still won the Best Comedy award for its show Transparent.  Netflix is also winning awards for its creative, data-driven content. In 2016, the company received eight Golden Globe nominations – more than any other television network that year. Netflix had succeeded in ending HBO’s 14-year winning streak, proving that the importance of user data shouldn’t be underestimated. It’s no secret that the advent of the internet brought several benefits. However, one downside of this technological feat is the proliferation of piracy – but there are ways to curtail it. Piracy is so detrimental because it allows consumers to receive content without paying. In 2015, the authors of Streaming, Sharing, Stealing presented a paper about the issue to the World Intellectual Property Organization. To compile this document, they surveyed all the peer-reviewed journal articles they could find that discussed the effect of piracy on sales. Of the 25 articles they unearthed, 22 reported instances in which piracy had significantly harmed sales. The Indian film industry in particular has suffered huge financial loss because of piracy. Back in 2014, the authors worked with the economist Joel Waldfogel to compare data on the industry gathered before 1985 and between the years 1985-2000. They discovered that the revenue generated declined rapidly as VCR-based piracy emerged. They also found that there was a significant decrease in the amount of movies produced in India post-1985 and that their quality also depreciated. In order to prevent piracy, consumers have to understand the risk of committing the crime. In 2012, the authors studied the effect of an anti-piracy law passed in France in 2009, which meant that notices about copyright infringement were sent to pirates. The fact that the law solely affected French consumers permitted the authors to examine its effect on iTunes sales patterns in the country. They ascertained that when it was legally dicier to commit piracy, many consumers switched to legitimate consumption. The data also showed that the law caused a 20 to 25 percent increase in sales.   Therefore, as damaging as piracy can be, entertaining content can still be protected and shared fairly. It’s vitally important to do so, as piracy can cause artists and producers to lose their incentive to create new, high-quality work, causing consumers to ultimately lose out in the long run. The key message in this book: Since the twentieth century, the entertainment industry has changed significantly. The advent of the internet has meant that it’s easier to source and share content, and big companies no longer have a monopoly across the board. To succeed nowadays, businesses need to make use of user data and ensure the prevention of piracy.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

And the pleasures of stretching needn’t be limited to the physical realm. At work, you can stretch your mind by looking for creative solutions, being proactive about developing tasks that really interest you and interacting as much as possible with your coworkers and, during breaks, with other friends and acquaintances. Though fun, stretching is not always easy. Many office workers end up a crumpled, dispirited heap, gazing listlessly at their computer screens without any idea of what to do. It’s almost as if they’re just waiting to get fired. So how do you avoid this and become an alert and excited person instead? In these blinks, we’ll explore how to remain open and motivated in the workplace; how to multiply career options and opportunities; and how to bounce back strong after a career setback. Before entering the professional world, you are surrounded by parents and teachers who can point you in the right direction and straighten you out if you get off track. But after college, you’re more or less on your own, even though there’s still a great deal of growing, or stretching, that needs to be done. That’s why there are three stretch imperatives that every professional hoping to stay at the top of the game should keep in mind. The first stretch imperative is to remember that you are in control. If you’re unhappy with a job, it can be easy to blame your boss or be too lazy to do anything about it. But this isn’t good for you or your employer. Let’s look at a typical career: You graduate from college and decide to pick up a job in construction because you thought you might enjoy working with your hands. But after a while you realize that you’d rather work with people. What do you do? You take control and find another job, this time as a camp counselor. But here you realize you’d rather work with adults instead of kids, so you decide to work in sales instead. And this leads us to the second stretch imperative: Give yourself options and broaden your horizons so that you have a healthy amount of possible opportunities. Let’s say you hate your boss in the sales department but you don’t have the qualifications for anything else. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, you take action. You sign up for adult education classes and earn a second or third degree, such as an MBA. And this brings us to the third stretch imperative: Setting goals. These don’t have to be related to your career; they just need to be realistic goals that will help you stay on track, especially during tough times. Everyone hits a rough patch at one point or another in their career. When you hit one, remember that gaining experiences is always productive and will help you in the search for what’s right for you. If you’ve worked at enough office jobs, then you’re surely familiar with the unhappy employee who dozes off at his desk, despite a veritable drip feed of caffeine. No one wants to be this employee. In fact, the best kind of employee is the polar opposite of dissatisfied and slumberous. She’s alert and engaged, learning on the job and continuing to develop her skill set. If you have a full-time job, then you know how hard it can be to continue your education in the small amount of spare time you do have. That’s why you must learn on the job. Let’s look at Jonah, who got a job as a teacher, but began to worry after realizing how difficult his work really was. He knew he needed to improve, but he had no time to get more training. So he took matters into his own hands. Jonah performed a self-assessment and realized that he needed to be more organized, so he began interviewing other teachers on how he could better structure his class. He also recognized that too much class time was spent with him talking, and that students learned more when they had time to practice. So he shortened his lectures and created more practical exercises that allowed his students to develop their skills. The results were great: Jonah is now training other teachers and on track to becoming the next school principal. The key is that Jonah was open to change and feedback, a quality that is essential to keeping yourself from getting stuck in a career rut. Chris, a frustrated executive trainer who was having trouble connecting with his trainees, is another good example of the benefits of openness. Despite the trouble he was having, Chris remained open with his boss and receptive to the feedback he received. This allowed Chris and his boss to work together and pinpoint the problem. Eventually it became clear that Chris wasn’t listening to his trainees. He’d developed a habit of criticizing their ideas before they could fully explain themselves. By being open to change and feedback, Chris learned that being a leader isn’t about him – it’s about being part of a team. And once he began listening to his team members, his leadership skills greatly improved. It’s generally a good idea to give yourself options. Most people don’t apply to only one college or send out applications to only one job. They put their eggs in multiple baskets. Use the same approach for your career and increase your options by utilizing a broad network of contacts. Everyone has at least two different kinds of contacts: professional colleagues and personal friends. Both can be used to provide more options as your career progresses. For example, Zach started out in a marketing company, working day and night and never taking the time to develop a social life or expand his contact list. And when Zach decided to strike out on his own, he was working even longer hours, but still not giving any attention to his contacts – even though he was growing quite concerned about his lack of clients. Luckily he had one good personal contact – his dad, who was an experienced entrepreneur and recognized his problem right away. He explained to Zack the importance of having good contacts, especially in the world of sales. Sure enough, after focusing on his network and sharpening his social skills, Zach’s company began to thrive. Another way to increase your career options is to collect a variety of experiences. You may not have a clear idea of what you want to do with your life, so why not try a number of different jobs and discover what’s out there? Alexandra did exactly this after earning a graduate degree in international relations and feeling disillusioned after working for a financial service company during the 2008 economic crisis. As Alexandra began to reflect on what she wanted to do with her life, she realized she had a real passion for nature and conservation. She was drawn to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, and began reaching out to people from the organization and adding them to her network. Those within Lewa recognized that Alexandra’s experience in finance and international relations could be a great benefit, so they hired her as an international-development manager. And with Lewa on her résumé, Alexandra was able to add nature conservation to her growing list of experiences. When your career hits rock bottom, one of two things can happen to it: it can either shatter like a glass or bounce back to new heights like a rubber ball. With the right frame of mind, you can turn a career setback into the start of a new chapter. If you lose your job, there’s no reason to give up – especially if you have your network in place and remember that you’re still in control. So keep in mind that any setback can be an opportunity to gain experiences and propel forward movement. Even when things look bleak, you can come soaring back. All it takes is the right amount of positive determination. When journalist Jill Abramson was run over by a truck in New York City, she had to face an enormous uphill battle to learn how to walk again. But that’s exactly what she did, because she never gave up her belief that she could accomplish the goals she set for herself. And not only did she get back on her feet; she went on to become the first female executive director of the New York Times. To help you hold on to your goals when times are tough, here are three “ounces” of advice: The first is to pounce. You’ve got to keep learning and takings risks. Don’t worry about looking dumb or falling on your face. It’s far more important to stay curious and always be asking questions. The second is to trounce. Keep practicing and developing your skills no matter how many times you fail. It’s not about reaching perfection, it’s about continuing to grow and knowing that sooner or later your continual practice will pay off. The third is to announce. Share both your goals and difficulties with your peers. This will keep you focused on reaching those goals as well as on improving yourself. After all, it’s easy to let a goal slip away if you’re the only one who knows about it, so improve your chances of following through by letting the world know what you’re aiming for. It’s common for people to have anxieties about an unpredictable future, but when you take the right steps toward becoming aware and prepared, you can rest easy. One thing’s for sure: Whatever career path you are currently on will change within your lifetime. Everything about the traditional workday is changing. The hours are becoming more flexible just as companies are becoming less tied down to physical locations. Even universities are responding to the constant changes by regularly updating their programs to match emerging fields. Indeed, both universities and corporations know how important it is for adults to keep learning new skills. Georgia Tech, Udacity and AT&T, in an effort to keep the US workforce up to date and competitive, have pooled their resources to create a relatively accessible master’s degree program in computer science that only costs $7,000. Workplace hierarchies are flattening out these days, so it’ll also be to your advantage if you can show employers that you come with your own leadership skills and the ability to turn visions into reality. Ideally, this should also include a strong capacity to collaborate and work with social media. But being prepared for the future requires non-technical skills as well. You shouldn’t underestimate emotional intelligence as a key part of your continued development, which means learning how to accurately understand and respond to the emotions of others. After all, it’s not just the economy that’s changing; people are changing, too. Lady Gaga recognized this a few years ago. In 2012, she launched the Born This Way Foundation to promote emotional intelligence, well-being and kindness in schools. So if you really want to secure your place in tomorrow’s workforce, develop a sharp emotional intelligence. It will allow you to explain how your personality complements your skills, making you an indispensable asset for any company. The key message in this book: In order to stay competitive in the future, you have to keep learning today. So stay current and observe the changes going on around you. With the right perspective, you can stay ahead of the curve while simultaneously collecting contacts, experiences and furthering your education. With this foresight, you’ll be in a good position no matter what lays ahead. Actionable advice: Become helpful instead of doleful. If you don’t feel like you’re being useful at your workplace, don’t just sit there being depressed. Find at least one thing that you can do to make someone’s life a little easier at work. If you’re not sure how to do that, observe your coworkers with genuine interest and curiosity. This will help you develop empathy, grow your network and gain new inspiration for ways in which you can be more engaged and happy at work. Got feedback?

While it used to take decades or even centuries for a world-changing technology to emerge, we now experience such shifts every few years. It’s this exponential growth that will inevitably lead to a world run by intelligent machines. Interestingly enough, the development of artificial intelligence is in many ways a continuation of our own human intelligence. One could argue that AI is what will allow humans to surpass the limits of biological evolution and continue to follow the developmental trajectory of life on Earth. In these blinks, you’ll learn how the universe was formed and how life on Earth began; what computers will be capable of in the year 2099; and how we humans can transcend the limits of our own biology. Technology is accelerating at an ever-greater pace. We now live in a world of artificial intelligence, drones and 3D printing, but all this rapid-fire change stands in stark contrast to the origins of the universe. In fact, as the universe began to grow, time actually slowed down. Here’s the story: About 15 billion years ago, the universe was born. From there, it took just 10-43 seconds, a tiny fraction of a blink of an eye, for the newly created cosmos to cool down to what was still a whopping hundred million trillion trillion degrees, a temperature low enough for gravity to develop. About 10-34 seconds after the development of gravity, the universe had cooled to a billion billion billion degrees, which allowed matter – subatomic particles like electrons and quarks – to arise. Approximately 10-10 seconds after matter was created, electromagnetic forces like light began to emerge. And, finally, 10-5 seconds after electromagnetic forces were born, the temperature cooled to a paltry trillion degrees. Quarks could then form protons and neutrons. But then things began to slow down. As the universe expanded, events became more spaced out. From tiny fractions of seconds to hours, years, hundreds of thousands of years, and so on. The basic building blocks of the universe popped into existence in no time at all, but the larger pieces came into existence much more slowly – it was hundreds of thousands of years before the first atom formed, and hundreds of millions before the formation of galaxies. Earth didn’t exist until nine billion years later! As life-forms began to evolve on Earth, however, time began to speed up. The first of these single-celled organisms was formed some 3.4 billion years ago, about a billion years after the formation of Earth. From that point on, evolution gained momentum. Seven hundred million years ago, plants and animals – the first multicellular creatures – evolved. In the 130 million years that followed, the basic physiological structures of animals, like spinal cords, appeared. These new structures not only enabled primordial fish to propel themselves through the water, they also marked a significant acceleration in evolutionary time. As this pattern continued, the primates emerged and, pretty soon, evolution could be measured in tens of millions of years, rather than hundreds. Evolution may be a complex, confusing process, but there’s one specific factor at play in the evolution of all life. It’s called computation: the ability to store information and use it to solve problems. This ability is what enables exponential evolutionary development. For instance, in regards to the evolution of life on Earth, organs emerged as a means of maintaining the internal conditions of the body and responding to external stimuli. These useful structures were the result of an increasingly evolved and complex nervous system that eventually made it possible for us to store memories and recognize patterns, to which we could then respond. But computation obviously doesn’t apply to biology alone; it’s central to technology as well. As humans developed and refined technology, machines were eventually created that could maintain themselves, store information and identify patterns even better than humans. Just consider the evolution of the mechanical calculating machine. This technology was first created in the 1600s, and it became increasingly complex in the years that followed. It had evolved into an electrical tabulating system that stored data on punched cards. This machine, invented by Herman Hollerith, was powerful enough to automate the entire 1890 US Census. Unsurprisingly, computation has allowed technology to evolve exponentially, just like the people who created it. This rapid evolution began in earnest during the nineteenth century, which saw the advent of photography and telephonic communication, as well as the mass construction of railroads. Perhaps most interesting of all is the fact that this process is still accelerating at an exponential rate. For example, the technological progress achieved during the first two decades of the twentieth century exceeded that of the entire nineteenth century. Nowadays, in the twenty-first century, it takes just a couple of years to see major shifts in technological growth. Now you know that time has variously sped up and slowed down since the birth of the universe. But how is this possible? It all depends on the degree of chaos in the world and how it impacts evolution. (In this case, “chaos” simply means the prevalence of random events). A general rule of thumb is that time expands exponentially – that is, it slows down dramatically – in response to exponential increases in the chaos of a closed system. Such a system is one that isn’t impacted by any external influences. This rule is called the Law of Increasing Chaos and a good example of it is the development of the universe. At the moment the universe started expanding, it was empty and singular. Then, chaos began to exponentially grow through the emergence of significant events like the emergence of gravity, matter, and light. Eventually, time intervals began to expand, meaning that the amount of time necessary for further development to occur increased exponentially. So it is that today the universe is home to billions of galaxies, all united in a vast, seemingly never-ending space. Such a picture may seem about as chaotic as can be, but the truth is that the universe is still far from its peak, which is likely billions of years away. In stark contrast to the Law of Increasing Chaos is The Law of Accelerating Returns, which means that time exponentially contracts, or accelerates, as order exponentially increases in any given process. This law regulates evolution, both of our species and of technology. Because of the order that these processes foster, evolution can increase its rate. As an example, consider the evolution of basic life-forms. Once single-celled organisms evolved, life began to develop at an exponential rate. This is because DNA established a starting point for future attempts. The orderly structure provided by DNA means that evolution doesn’t have to start from scratch every time, and this reduces the amount of chaos. That’s why this principle is called the Law of Increasing Returns. It refers to the product of the evolutionary process, which accelerates exponentially relative to the increases in order. So now you know how this logic applies to human and technological evolution. In the next blink, you’ll learn how it relates to something in between. How do you construct an intelligent machine? It certainly requires a number of material resources. But it also requires knowledge. Just like humans, machines can’t solve problems if they lack the knowledge to work through them. So how can a machine acquire this knowledge? One option is for humans to feed information into machines in big chunks, but this approach doesn’t work for all knowledge. A better route is to design computers that can learn for themselves, just like humans. To accomplish this, neural nets are used to design computing systems that mimic the processes of the human brain. Such structures enable machines to learn from information gathered from the environment and transform it into knowledge. For instance, computers will eventually be able to read and comprehend any written document. They’ll be able to understand the content of literature and eventually be so advanced that they’ll gather knowledge and share it among themselves. But knowledge isn’t all that smart machines need. They also rely on computation. As you learned earlier, the human brain is capable of computation, but only at a slow and limited pace. After all, with limited memory capacity, people struggle to remember even a dozen phone numbers. Machines, on the other hand, have no trouble searching a database of millions of numbers and recalling them all in an instant. Ultimately, that’s why DNA needs to be removed from the equation. While DNA has enabled life to evolve from a single cell into the powerful form of human beings, its limited neural capacity will never serve as the foundation for new and better designs. Interestingly enough, evolution has solved this problem itself. In the form of human beings, it has created organisms that are capable of creating technology that doesn’t rely on DNA for its evolution. At this point, you know that machine intelligence is evolving just like that of living organisms – and with much greater potential. So what are computers going to look like in the year 2029? It probably goes without saying that computers in the future are going to be capable of a whole lot more than they were in the past. For instance, while a computing device could be expected to run 20 million billion calculations per second by 2019, a computer in 2029 will likely be able to run a thousand times more. That means that a computer worth $1,000 will be as powerful as a thousand human brains. In fact, computing is largely done on massive parallel neural nets that are in large part modeled on those of the human brain. Such a process is a great example of reverse engineering, in that computers have been designed to “think” like humans. The circuitry of computers is even based on that of the human brain. In the future, computers will play a greater role in innumerable arenas of life, education among them. That doesn’t mean more computers in classrooms; rather, it means human teachers will mostly be replaced by virtual ones. It’s even likely that neural implants, tiny computers that are surgically inserted into the human brain, will enhance learning by increasing the human capacities for perception and memory. That being said, in 2029, knowledge won’t just be downloaded into our brains; we’ll still have to work to learn new material. And, finally, computers will also dramatically affect the field of communications. For instance, to supplement virtual reality technology, we’ll likely improve on forms of holographic and sonic communication. That means that people will be able to sit around the dinner table and converse with their families, even when they are all physically in different parts of the world. But for the most part, communication will take place between two computers. If a human does enter the picture, it’ll likely be to communicate with a machine of some type. Now that you’ve got an idea of what to expect from computers in the near future, let’s look even further ahead. At the close of the twenty-first century, in the year 2099, we’ll be in for a serious shift: human thought and computer intelligence will begin to merge. By this point, we can expect to have scanned and analyzed every single aspect of human neural function; the reverse engineering of the human brain will be complete. This accomplishment, combined with the capacity and speed of machine intelligence, will mean that smart machines will be more competitive than humans. The number of humans who use software to function will exceed by a wide margin those that still function solely on organic computation. Even this latter group will likely have neural implants to improve cognition and perception. In fact, if they don’t, they’ll be incapable of communicating meaningfully with those who do use such technology. In short, the entire definition of humanity will have changed. The innumerable ways that machine intelligence and human biology will eventually combine will require a redefinition of what it means to be human. And it won’t be long before intelligent machines begin to argue that, since they were created from human intelligence, they too are human, even if their brains are mere metal and silicon copies of the real human brain. This discussion will be accompanied by a debate about guaranteeing particular rights and powers to machine intelligence. In fact, such an argument will likely be one of the most pressing political and philosophical discussions of the time. In short, as technology evolves, one thing can be expected: the merger of humans and machines. And this will transform humanity as we know it. The key message in this book: The evolution of humanity from single-celled organisms occurred at an exponential rate, but there’s only so far that humans can develop given our biological limitations. In creating technology, humanity has begun to transcend these roadblocks and will eventually produce machines even smarter than people. In all probability, humans and machines will merge by the end of the twenty-first century. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The ubiquity of smartphones and tablets has deeply embedded the internet into our daily routine – we text our friends via WhatsApp, we post our vacation snapshots on Facebook, and we stream our favorite music and films online. But the rise of digital and social media doesn’t only change us, it also changes our children and how we raise them. In short, it changes parenthood. How much exposure to digital media is appropriate for a child? How can we save our children from sexually explicit or violence-glorifying content? And what do we do when our children are bullied on Facebook? In these blinks, you’ll learn about the risks that child-rearing in the digital age entails and, crucially, how to effectively protect your children from cyber hazards. You’ll also learn why people insult us so much in online chat rooms; why educational DVDs aren’t all they’re cracked up to be; and how Facebook can traumatize teenagers. If you’ve ever used a chat room, message board or social media site, you’ve probably been insulted by a stranger. These digital interactions aren’t meaningless: they have an impact on our socialization, especially children’s. Children develop empathy by interacting with other people. According to the psychiatrist Dan Siegel, children aren’t born with empathy: they develop it as they mature. They build social skills and learn to understand each other’s emotions as they fight, play and make friends. Spending a lot of time online disrupts this process. And if children spend too much time in the digital world, it can actually decrease their empathy. A group of Stanford researchers did over 70 studies on this phenomenon with college students. They did a systematic review of their studies based on standard empathy tests and found that, between 1979 and 2009, empathy in US college students decreased by 40 percent. The decline was particularly strong in the last ten years of that time frame, and technology was pinpointed as one of the main causes. Overexposure to digital media doesn’t only make people less empathetic. The fast pace of the digital world also makes it harder for children to concentrate. In 2006, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a survey of teenagers and found that those who did their homework on the computer were far less focused on their work. In fact, they spent at least two-thirds of their time doing something else entirely. Digital media has a big impact on a child’s development. It’s making it harder for children to focus in school, and the rude comments you’ve seen online probably come from young people whose empathy has been stunted. Any new parents can tell you how magical it is to look into their baby’s eyes or hear their child’s voice for the first time. So what happens when parents are too distracted by their smartphones to spend enough time with their babies? It could have devastating effects on their development. Babies need a lot of sensory attention from their parents. After all, that’s how they develop, both emotionally and intellectually. Sensory interaction is about mirroring, the process whereby a parent looks at baby, smiles and laughs, allowing the baby to mimic her actions and learn what she means. A team of researchers at the University of California found that when a parent fully engages with her child, it stimulates the parts of the child’s brain associated with language and abstract thought. Toddlers don’t get the same benefits from educational TV shows. Digital media gives babies and young children a lot of visual stimulation, but it doesn’t activate all the neurological areas necessary to develop speaking and reading skills. Children also suffer when their parents spend too much time on their devices. Patricia Kuhl from the University of Washington found that babies experience a lot of distress when they see an emotionless expression on their parent’s face. In the past, babies would interpret that type of expression as a sign of depression; today, it happens to be the same face a person has when they’re staring at a screen. As a result, babies who often see their parents with that face grow up in an emotionally insecure environment. And, when they’re finally ready for preschool after their first few years of living at home, new technology troubles await them. What was your favorite childhood game? Hide and seek? Playing dress up? Computer games might allow children to dress avatars up with clothes and accessories, but is it ever the same? Probably not. In fact, digital gaming seems to make preschoolers less creative and playful overall. A lot of preschool teachers report that children now just wait to receive instruction or mimic behavior from online games instead of engaging with each other. They’ve noticed two major trends: children are less creative now, and they’re less interested in playing. Children are starting to favor simpler and more repetitive games, like crashing objects into each other over and over. They spend less time on more complex, imaginative games like having tea parties or searching for buried treasure. Preschoolers are also less persistent about playing. Games like building paths for marbles with towers, bridges and chutes aren’t very popular anymore, as children no longer have the attention span for them. It’s harmful to children when they play less because they have to interact with each other to develop critical social skills. In his book Yardsticks, educator Chip Wood presented studies illustrating that the most important factor for a young child’s happiness and success in primary school is a positive relationship with his teacher and classmates. When children are drilled in reading and writing and discouraged from socializing, they’re worse off in the long term. They don’t perform as well in primary school as do children who were encouraged to play and develop their emotional intelligence in preschool. Children can only develop their social skills by socializing: games can’t replace play in real life. The children who are given time to play are much better off in the end. You probably remember a few instances from your childhood where you were exposed to images you weren’t old enough for yet. Maybe Freddy Krueger or the clown from It gave you nightmares or made it hard for you to fall asleep for a while. Children are at a much higher risk of this happening today. Technology makes it a lot easier for scary monsters or people to enter their world. Children can be traumatized by hurtful or abusive online interactions, for instance. The author had a ten-year-old client, Trevor, who once started receiving strange e-mails from an address he didn’t know. The e-mails were full of sexualized insults he couldn’t understand. An investigation revealed that the culprit was a ten-year-old girl Trevor had once made fun of. She created an e-mail address purely to harass him as revenge, and Trevor suffered from anxiety and depression for months. Children also need to be protected from media content that reinforces sexist and racist stereotypes. In her 2006 book Full of Ourselves, the author presents studies illustrating that computer games and TV cause children as young as three to have negative opinions of anyone who’s overweight. Moreover, most online media that targets girls focuses on fashion and beauty, reinforcing the idea that beauty gives them their worth. In 2007, researchers Nicole Martins and Kristen Harrison did a study on the effects of racist and sexist stereotypes in video games. They found that white boys have higher self-esteem after playing them, whereas girls and non-white boys felt worse afterward because of the negative ways women and non-white men are depicted. Did you ever have nightmares of being naked at school when you were a kid? Thanks to social media, that nightmare can now be a reality. Social media can exacerbate a child’s emotional instability by publicly exposing them in ways they can’t control. In one such case, three 11-year-old girls had lunch with three boys of the same age, and one of the boys took a photo of them. The girls didn’t mind at the time, but the boy ended up cropping their heads onto another photo of three naked women and circulating the new image online. It spread around their school, which was mortifying for the young girls. The internet also complicates sexual issues for teens and preteens. According to a 2012 Pew Internet survey, young teenagers often play age-inappropriate video games online. In fact, half the boys and 14 percent of the girls named a mature or adult-only game as their personal favorite. So young people are exposed to highly sexualized content at a time when they’re still very impressionable, which might lead them to believe that unusual practices, like violent fetishes, are normal. The internet has other ways of complicating sexuality. Take 13-year-old Alexa, for example, who once accidentally called a forgotten acquaintance and then had a tense conversation with him. Soon after, Alexa began receiving sexualized text messages. The acquaintance had posted her number on Craigslist as revenge, along with a suggestive photograph and text. The ordeal forced Alexa to get a new number in the end. And the problems don’t end when children grow out of their preteen years, either. As preteens mature into teenagers, the internet can skew their ideas about sexuality even more. When you were a teenager, did you ever lie about your sexual experience to fit in? Young people want approval from their peers, and social media now offers them the chance to embellish their identities. It’s easy to create an alternative persona for yourself online, but digital personas can be harmful to young people. Consider the story of three high school friends who kept in close touch online. One of them, Jill, preferred to text when discussing anything very personal. For two years, Jill had a volatile relationship with a boy she’d met at a summer camp and often sought advice from her two friends, who supported her. However, after Jill posted a photo of her boyfriend on Facebook, her friends soon found out the boyfriend didn’t really exist. Jill had made the whole thing up. The lie ended up costing Jill two of her closest friendships. They didn’t want to be friends with her anymore after discovering she had lied to them for so long. Texting and chatting can also make relationships harder for teenagers. We’ve seen that online interactions often lack empathy, and when it comes to online exchanges between hormonal teenagers, that can lead them to reduce each other to their sexuality. Fifteen-year-old Nora had a bad experience with this when she became interested in a classmate named Mike. In a text, Mike asked her if she would be his girlfriend so he could get her to perform oral sex on him. When teenagers are subjected to demeaning comments such as these, it hinders their ability to develop healthy relationships. Digital media increases their exposure to relationships lacking in empathy. Remember how embarrassing your parents were when you were a teenager? Maybe they got into a fight with your teacher or tried to befriend your secret crush. Whatever the reason, children often want to keep their problems to themselves. But it’s important that parents earn their children’s trust, which is key in protecting them from danger online. Children only tell their parents about their online problems if they feel they can rely on them. So how do you build that kind of confidence? You have to respect the same rules you want them to respect. Let’s take a father who drives his two daughters to school every day. He constantly goes over the speed limit and often texts while driving. And, every time the frightened daughters protest, he snaps at them to be quiet. That sort of behavior only undermines trust. If the father doesn’t follow the rules about driving and texting, he can’t expect his daughters to, either. They’ll probably just mimic his behavior. Parents also have to refrain from overreacting when their children do come to them with media-related problems. Children shy away from their parents if they’re afraid their parents will get upset or punish them. In the worst of cases, that could lead them to refrain from speaking up about bullying, pornography or online stalkers. The author had a 15-year-old client, for example, who didn’t want to show his father e-mails he exchanged with a teacher about their lessons. He knew if his father saw that the teacher didn’t always respond right away, the father would call the teacher himself. When parents are pushy like that, it makes their children less likely to confide in them. So stay open with your kids. The best thing you can do is be trustworthy, calm and approachable. The key message in this book: Children are better off without digital media until they’re at least five years old. It’s better for them to focus on socializing and playing, so they can develop critical emotional skills. As they grow up, parents need to protect them from online bullying and age-inappropriate images by maintaining a healthy relationship with them so their children feel comfortable coming forward with their problems. Technology affords children a lot of great opportunities, but it’s important to use it safely and wisely. Actionable advice: Leave your devices at home when you go into nature.  Take breaks from technology sometimes. Take your kids camping or on a trip to the sea. Get away from your smartphones and laptops for a while – it’ll be good for all of you. Got feedback?

Many of the headlines concern AI forays into art, music and other areas of human creativity. Perhaps AI art is such a hot topic because creativity is one of our most distinguishing features. In fact, the human urge to express oneself through art might be older than modern humans. For instance, archeologists have found 500,000-year-old carved shells in Java that they believe to be the work of Homo erectus, ancestor to both the Neanderthals and us. If creativity predates humans, is it possible that it will transcend us? Is the proliferation of AI already paving the way for the next step of evolution – giving rise to intelligent machine artists who create paintings, music and literature of their own?  To answer this question, mathematician and art enthusiast Marcus du Sautoy takes us on a journey, from the basic principles of computing to the math of music and the near future of art-making AI.  In these blinks you’ll learn about the three different types of human creativity; the common language that unites math, music and computing; and a computer program able to compose symphonies like Bach. Let’s face it: in many ways, computers are smarter than people. They can store more facts, crunch bigger numbers and they’re better at spelling. Perhaps the one thing we humans can still take solace in is our creativity. Surely a machine could never come up with a joke, compose a symphony or write a book – or could it? To answer this existential query, let’s first take a look at what we mean when we talk about creativity. Being creative means coming up with something new, surprising and valuable. French painter Claude Monet is famous for his beautiful paintings of water lilies – but his paintings are more than just beautiful. Layering flecks upon flecks of color instead of using traditional brush strokes, Monet showed the world a new way to appreciate the interplay of light and color. This novel painting style, called impressionism, inspired generations of artists and helped pave the way from figurative to abstract art. Just as our ideas about art have changed over the centuries, so too have our ideas of creativity constantly evolved. We often measure a creative act by how much it differs from those that have come before. Consider early twentieth-century composer Arnold Schönberg. Composers before Schönberg took for granted that a central key, or tone, was the basis for any composition. Schönberg boldly disregarded this rule to invent atonality – bringing the world unexpected listening pleasures. Cognitive scientist Margaret Boden calls this type of rule-breaking transformational creativity. Transformational creativity can completely overturn what we think is possible in a given discipline. In addition, Boden identified two other types of creativity. She says that Monet’s work exhibits exploratory creativity – that it explores what is possible within the rules of the discipline. Monet still depicted water lilies in a figurative way, but he did so in a completely new, impressionist, manner. Combinatorial creativity is the ability to merge structures that, on the surface, might not belong together. Contemporary architect Zaha Hadid translates her love of abstract art into impossible-looking, curvaceous buildings. The Heydar Aliyev Centre that she designed in Azerbaijan, for instance, looks less like a building than an oversized seashell. Her buildings are also a great example of the practical applications of creativity. Creativity, it turns out, isn’t just for artists. Being creative means bending – sometimes even breaking – the rules to come up with something new. But this skill isn’t limited to art, music and literature. Look closely, and you’ll find creativity in places you’d never expect, such as the author’s field: math.  To understand how mathematicians are creative, we must first understand what they do.  A mathematician uses logical arguments to prove theorems from axioms. Axioms are mathematical statements that we assume to be true. For example, we assume that: √1= 1 A theorem is the new mathematical statement that the mathematician needs to prove. Maybe we want to show that: √1≠ 1 To do this, we have to use logical steps to connect the existing axioms about square numbers with our new theorem. But advanced math is about much more than following rules and applying cold logic. Just like good art, good math requires thinking outside the box and telling compelling stories. Mathematicians don’t want to prove theorems that are boring and obvious. They want to prove theorems that are bold, unexpected and deepen our understanding of the world. Doing this requires intuition and creativity. Grigori Perelman displayed both these qualities when he proved the Poincaré conjecture, a now-famous theorem that describes all the different geometrical shapes in our universe. To prove the theorem, he applied the rules of a completely different area of mathematics. Using the way liquid flows over a surface, Perelman was able to describe the entire range of shapes that can possibly exist. His combinatorial creativity produced new and surprising insight into our universe. But even a genius like Perelman can’t do his work alone. With every successful proof, the field of math is getting more complex. For a discipline that’s as old as civilization itself, this means that many calculations are now so complicated that even the greatest mathematician couldn’t solve them with pen and paper. Today’s mathematicians need computers to process the mass of numbers with which they’re dealing. These machines have become indispensable. In fact, Israeli mathematician Doron Zeilberger insists on including his computer, which he calls Shalosh B. Ekhad, as co-author of his mathematical papers. By freeing them from tedious calculations and diminishing the margin of human error, computers allow mathematicians to think more creatively than ever. Mathematicians and computers have something in common – they both follow sets of logical rules to reach a desired outcome. The rules encoded into a computer are called algorithms. You can think of them as a bunch of “if-then” sentences that tell the computer how to behave. For example, your email filter may follow the rule, “if an email contains the word Viagra, then place it in the spam folder.” But algorithms do much more than sort your emails for you. This should come as no surprise. Companies like Amazon, Netflix and Spotify use algorithms to inundate you with recommendations. Their algorithms try to predict which music, movies or products you might like, based on your previous choices. More contentiously, algorithms now even pick our romantic partners for us. The dating site OkCupid evaluates your personality traits, likes and dislikes to find you matches. Though in a recent study of couples who married between 2005 and 2012, those who met online seemed significantly happier than couples who met offline. Do algorithms know something we don’t? Well, algorithms often work by asking various layers of questions about massive amounts of data. Have you ever wondered how a website comes out on top of the Google search? Their search algorithm measures the value of a website by asking how many other websites have linked to it. Then, using the same measure, it asks how valuable those other websites are. If your business website is linked to on many high-value websites like CNN, it will climb higher in the search rankings. This creates a complicated system of cross-evaluation that requires collecting and comparing more data than a human brain could ever handle. Moreover, many algorithms grow smarter as you interact with them. You’ve probably noticed that the more you use Netflix, Amazon or Spotify, the more these services seem to “get” your taste. This is because every time you use them, you give their algorithms more data to work with. And the algorithms learn to read your data better. With time, Netflix will understand that you watched Sleepless in Seattle not because you’re a huge romantic comedy fan, but because you really like Tom Hanks. Instead of directing you to Notting Hill, it might take you to Forrest Gump. Algorithms that are able to learn in such a way have changed the prospects of artificial intelligence. Before the dawn of machine learning, programmers were united in the belief that “You can only get out what you put in.” Meaning, a program is only as smart as the person who coded it. So, what changed their mind? It was a computer that plays board games. Go is an ancient Chinese board game that requires intelligence, skill and creativity. Two players take turns placing black and white stones on a 19 x 19 grid. The goal is to capture your opponent’s stones by surrounding them with your own. Because Go requires complex pattern recognition and because the number of possible games is endless, it was long believed to be impossible to teach a computer how to play it. But in 2016, in a man-versus-machine showdown followed around the globe, Demis Hassabis’s AlphaGo computer took down the reigning human Go champion Lee Sedol in a four-to-one victory. How did AlphaGo achieve the impossible? Hassabis and his team used the technique of machine learning to develop their Go-playing computer. They encoded a few basic rules into AlphaGo. Then, they let the computer write the rest of the rules itself by trial and error. In coding, this is called a bottom-up approach, and it’s the basis of machine learning. Just like a human, AlphaGo learned to play Go, well, by playing Go. Whenever AlphaGo made a move that led to its victory, it updated its probabilities to be more likely to make that move again. Conversely, when it made a move that led to its defeat, it became less likely to make that move again. By the time AlphaGo faced Lee Sedol, it had come up with strategies that no human Go player had ever thought of.  The more data an AI like AlphaGo has to train with, the smarter it becomes. Machine learning, therefore, owes no small part to the huge amount of data that is available today – 90 percent of which was created in the last five years! This mass of information, paired with the ability of programs to rewrite themselves using that information, has opened the possibility of machines becoming smarter than us. In 1993, classical composer David Cope released Bach by Design, an album of original piano pieces typical of eighteenth-century composer Johann Sebastian Bach. But the pieces weren’t written by Bach, nor were they written by Cope. They were written by Emmy, a musical software created by Cope to simulate Bach’s composition style. The AI did such a good job that it fooled even seasoned Bach lovers. At a concert at the University of Oregon, the audience mistook one of her compositions for the original Bach – judging a lesser-known piece by the real Bach to be a fake. How can a computer program compose music that sounds more like Bach than Bach himself? Classical composers use algorithms to create musical complexity. They start with a simple melody, or theme, and then transform this theme according to mathematical rules. Using math, they create variations and additional voices to build the composition. Composers with a strong signature style are drawn to certain mathematical patterns over others. Mozart, for instance, often used the Alberti bass pattern. This pattern consists of three notes played in a sequence of 13231323. Emmy was trained to pick out the mathematical patterns typical of Bach, and could then use them to build compositions that sounded just like him. Another musical AI, an instrument called the Continuator, can pick out and replicate the musical patterns of jazz music. Analyzing thousands of jazz pieces, its software learned that some notes and sequences are more likely to follow others. Using the probabilities calculated from this training data, the Continuator has learned to improvise. If you play a jazz riff on it, it can continue that riff just like a human jazz player might do. Even pop music is exploring the possibilities of musical algorithms. Massive Attack’s 2016 album Heligoland comes with an app called Fantom that uses your location, time zone and Twitter feed to create a seamless, customized mix of the tracks for you. In a more democratic fashion, experimental musician Brian Eno has developed his own musical apps that let you interact with and modify his ambient compositions. Now that you know that music and computers are linked through the mathematical language of algorithms, it’s perhaps easier to see how a computer program can write a song. But music isn’t the only artistic discipline the machines have mastered. We’ve gotten to know computers that compose classical music and improvise jazz riffs. Musicians, it seems, are already making ample use of the growing capabilities of AI. But what about the rest of the art world? Computers that create visual art are actually not that new. As early as 1965, Siemens engineer Georg Nees programmed a computer to create drawings on its own. Nees’s program started from a fixed point on the screen, drawing 23 connected lines of random lengths in random directions. The result was a fascinating series of geometrical drawings. A more advanced art-making AI was recently developed by computer scientist Ahmed Elgammal of Rutgers University. Elgammal developed a Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, that can classify and produce images of visual art. A GAN is a system of two algorithms in which one algorithm learns and changes based on the feedback of the other. Elgammal’s GAN mirrors the two competing systems of our creative brains: the creator and the critic. While one of the algorithms is tasked with creating images, the other algorithm judges their originality. The critic algorithm was trained on data from WikiArt to identify images that marked moments of great creative change in art history, such as Monet’s water lilies. It uses this knowledge to assess and direct the images produced by the creator algorithm. Humans seem to agree with its judgment – visitors to Art Basel 2016 rated the GAN’s work as more inspiring than the human artworks on display! AIs have arrived in the world of writing too. Many media outlets are already using text processing programs to generate news clippings. Given raw data, these programs can write short, coherent texts that follow the structure of a typical news post. This is especially useful for sports and stock market reports, where the amount of data generated each day has become too tedious for humans to handle. Similar to musical AIs, modern writing programs can even learn to write in the style of a particular author. Analyzing word choice and sentence structure, an AI can churn out a paragraph that sounds like a passage from Ernest Hemingway. In fact, our author claims that a 350-word section of his own book was written by an algorithm! As we’ll see in the next blink, though, image-making and storytelling still hold some peculiar problems for AI. Consider this sentence: “The children won’t eat the grapes because they are old.” Who or what is old? Unlike you – a human with some experience with children and grapes – a computer couldn’t easily answer this question. It has no definitive way of knowing who is meant by “they” in this sentence. Natural language is full of such ambiguities. How we interpret a word often depends on context, requiring prior knowledge of the world. Because computers lack the type of intuitive knowledge that humans gather through experience, linguistic nuance is often lost on them. For the same reason, they struggle to create a meaningful narrative structure. Computer programs may be able to write a few sentences that sound like Hemingway, but they are nowhere near understanding, let alone weaving, a story like The Old Man and the Sea. Apart from language, another big problem area for AI is vision. Computers, it turns out, are pretty bad at seeing the bigger picture. That’s because visual programs identify images by asking questions about the pixels that make up the image. But for each picture of, say, a cat, the composition of pixels is completely different. The program has to learn to relate the pixels to one another and then judge whether those relations are indicative of a cat, or something else. You can find an advanced visual recognition like this in the Xbox One Kinect motion sensor. The Kinect can identify and map 31 distinct body parts by comparing the depth and distance of each pixel to those of its surroundings. Still, its abilities are nowhere near human vision. That’s why many websites make you pick out images of cars, road signs or cats to make sure that you’re not a robot. Curiously, AIs can use their peculiar nonhuman vision to create fascinating art. Google’s DeepDream program works by feeding an AI a blurred image, then asking it to enhance the image’s features according to what it expects it to be. Because the AI is trained on images from Google search that typically contain people, animals or other objects, it tends to over-interpret the blurred picture – seeing eyes, hands, and faces where there are none. The results are colorful, psychedelic images that could pass as modern art. But does that mean that DeepDream is an artist? Though there’s still room for technical improvement, there’s no doubt that AIs are already creating fascinating pieces of art, music and writing. Creations like the psychedelic images of DeepDream surprise even the programmers behind the programs, proving that, in modern computing, you can get more out than you put in. But creativity is about more than processing input and generating output. Drawing something of creative value from the algorithmic calculations of a computer still requires a human hand. Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges provides a useful analogy in his short story The Library of Babel. In it, he describes a library that contains every 410-page book that could possibly exist, from the first 410 pages of Tolstoy’s War and Peace to 410 pages filled with the letter N. But, because the library contains just any book with 410 pages, the majority of them – such as the N-book – have little value. It requires a human mind to search for the books with meaning, and discover a gem like War and Peace. Just like the Library of Babel contains infinite books without regard for their content, computers can process infinite data without caring about the meaning attached to it. But for humans, creativity is all about meaning. Art, music and literature are areas to explore our shared humanity and produce new insights into the world. Moreover, we’re creative of our own free will. Monet, Bach and Hemingway didn’t create their work because someone told them to. They created their work because they felt an urge to express themselves. For all their capabilities, no AI has yet created a piece of art of its own volition. These programs paint, write and compose because humans have programmed them to do so. That’s why it’s a stretch to call them creative in their own right. After all, it’s human creativity that created them in the first place. Until they become conscious like us, machines probably won’t be creative like us. At the moment, we have no way of telling if or how machine consciousness will emerge. But when it happens, perhaps the art, music and literature created by conscious machines will provide us with the best insights into their artificial minds. The key message in these blinks: Thanks to machine learning, the talents of modern AI exceed many of our previous expectations. Although they’re still struggling to recognize images and understand language, computers already create fascinating pieces of art, music and literature. However, until they learn to do so consciously and with purpose, they remain creative tools rather than being creative agents themselves. Actionable advice: Learn about the algorithms that control your life. Big companies like Google, Netflix and Amazon use ever-evolving algorithms to direct your consumer choices. They even track your browsing habits outside of their websites to calculate what to sell you. By learning about which data these companies collect about you, and the principles by which their algorithms operate, you’ll be able to gauge the influence they have on your life – and make conscious decisions to circumvent it.

What to read next: How to Create a Mind, by Ray Kurzweil Creativity is just one of the puzzling features of the human brain that AI technologies seek to reproduce. While our author du Sautoy is skeptical that machines will develop conscious and creative brains like us anytime soon, futurist Ray Kurzweil gives a more optimistic prognosis in his best seller How to Create a Mind. In this 2012 AI classic, Kurzweil examines the nuts and bolts behind how your brain works to show that machine creativity, and even machine consciousness, might not be as far off as you think.

Rosen","summary":"What’s the first thing you do when you need to find the solution to a problem or find some information? Most likely, you reach for your smartphone. With a world of information constantly at the ready in your pocket, there’s hardly any information you can’t find within seconds. And do you even remember what it was like trying to keep up contact with all your friends before Facebook? Let’s make no mistake. There are definite pluses to living in an interconnected high-tech world. But there are downsides too. Our brains are the product of millions of years’ worth of evolution. They have developed to operate in a certain way. Unfortunately, we’re hard-wired to get distracted, and new technology is hardly helping. These blinks explain just how the brain works and what strategies can be deployed so that you don’t use your smartphone unless you have to. Don’t worry; this isn’t a guide to returning to the Stone Age! It’s a pointer to enjoying life and getting the most out of it. Along the way, you’ll learn how your brain responds when you see a terrifying lion; how often people reach for their smartphones each day; and what to do to change your brain for the better. The human brain is unquestionably one of the wonders of the universe. With it, we can achieve incredible feats – from solving complicated math problems to learning languages and designing cars and jets. In short, it’s one of the most complex systems in the known universe. In fact, it’s this complexity that helps us set goals and perform an incalculable number of tasks. From gossiping with friends to presenting the next big project for colleagues at work, our brain is equipped with decision-making, planning and evaluation abilities. More formally, these are known as executive functions. After this planning function, another faculty of the brain is necessary to actually accomplish tasks. Specifically, we need cognitive control. These are cognitive abilities like attention, goal management and working memory. If we didn’t have cognitive control, there’d be no way to make conscious decisions that inform and have an impact upon our lives. Instead, we’d just respond unthinkingly and mechanically to the world around us. Imagine you’re wandering the aisles of your local supermarket because you need food and drinks for friends who are coming over that night. If you were to suddenly lose all cognitive control, your ability to pay attention to and remember that goal would simply vanish. Instead of tracking down beer and snacks, you’d be walking through the aisles without aim. Unfortunately, nowadays, our cognitive control is under more stress and strain than ever before. Consequently, we are distracted from our goals even more. This has a lot to do with complexity and the complicated nature of the brain in particular. More complex systems are more vulnerable to interference. If we’d evolved so that we could cognitively control our minds despite constant interference, that would be great. But we haven’t. In fact, our cognitive control seems to have evolved less than our executive functions. In other words, we’re collectively great at setting goals but far worse at seeing them through. This explains why we all tend to forget tasks like calling on a friend’s birthday or turning off the lights. We might like to imagine that we’re in full control of our behavior, but that’s far from the case. We can’t help the way environmental stimuli cause us to respond automatically. These external stimuli are called bottom-up influences. Typically, they’re characterized by saliency, which means they are immediately noticeable to us, like, for example, when you hear someone shouting your name. Additionally, these stimuli have novelty – a dramatic and unexpected quality such as a car backfiring. There’s nothing we can do to stop our involuntary responses to bottom-up influences. And for good reason. They are the mark of the survival instinct we’ve inherited from our ancestors. Thankfully, we are more than just passive creatures, primed only to respond to sudden stimuli for immediate survival. In general, our actions are guided by the perception-action cycle: we perceive the world in a certain way and act accordingly. We have also evolved the ability to pause in the moment and evaluate our perception of a given situation. That means we can decide upon the best response at the time. These internal decision-making mechanisms are called top-down influences. Let’s look at an example. Imagine a baby pinches your arm. You pull away quickly in pain, but you aren’t going to hit back blindly in response, as you’re aware you’re in no danger. No action is taken because of the “pause” in the cycle when you evaluate and act upon possible responses. Now that we’ve glanced into the brain's workings, let’s try to understand why it’s so difficult for us to achieve self-imposed goals. Although we can’t hold buzzing smartphones or flashing TV screens entirely responsible for distracting us, it’s nonetheless clear that modern technology has put considerable strain on our cognitive control. More precisely, modern technologies exploit our brain’s intrinsic susceptibility to interference. They impede our performance and sidetrack us from our goals. You know the feeling: even though you’re in an important meeting you just can’t help glancing at your phone. Or maybe you totally zone out at the dinner table because the game is playing on the TV next door, and you can hear the crowd reaching fever pitch. The obvious solution might be to keep clear of cafés, TVs and the internet when you’ve got an objective you want to achieve. But it’s not that simple. The truth is, we let ourselves be distracted because these interferences are a basic facet of what it is to be human. Our primitive primate brains were always on the lookout for food, as that’s what we needed to survive. Nowadays, this instinct remains, but it expresses itself as a search for information as well as food. Consequently, we get the same hit of satisfaction from activities like googling, Twitter browsing, or TV watching as we did when we were primates foraging for food. Amazingly, even when this behavior hampers performance and interferes with our goals, we let it continue. It’s actually just part of being human and, interestingly, it’s a drive that’s linked to our internal reward systems. For instance, a 2009 study of macaque monkeys showed that when primates receive information, their dopamine systems are activated just as they are when food is found. That may explain why we end up juggling smartphones, TVs and tablets. We crave that hit of dopamine. We’ve seen that we have hardwired responses to information. But this means we have to recognize how the current high-tech world makes it all the more easy for us to get distracted. Specifically, there are three technologies which deliberately accentuate interference and have significantly changed societal behavior. These are the internet, smartphones and social media. First off, the internet provides us with an endless supply of ready information at all times. It’s also thanks to the internet that we have email, a form of free and instant communication. Mobile computing has meant that the internet is now everywhere too. This is most visible in the omnipresence of smartphones. A single device that can browse the web, stream video and music, take pictures and share them can now be carried everywhere. This probably explains why 860 million Europeans and 7 in 10 people in the United States have a smartphone. And these objects are put through their paces too. On average a smartphone is picked up 27 times a day. And that’s just the average: some people pick them up as many as 150 times a day! These three technologies make it extremely difficult to focus on one task at a time or to sustain focus over a long period. We might like to tell ourselves that we’re “multitasking,” but in reality, we’re just jumping between different tasks without giving sufficient attention to any. A 2013 study conducted by one of the authors showed just this. Students could only keep their attention on one task for three to five minutes at a time before they directed their focus elsewhere. This occurs in non-work environments too. The next time you’re at a café, look at all the couples and friends who can’t help playing with their smartphones instead of engaging with each other. That impulse is observable under test conditions too. A 2012 study showed that younger adults switch tasks, on average, 27 times every hour. Older adults do it a little less, but 17 times every hour is still quite high. Brace yourself for this next tidbit. In 2004 in the United States, an estimated 559 people had to seek medical help after smashing into stationary objects while simultaneously texting and walking. Since then the number has surged. In 2010, the number had climbed to a whopping 1,500. And these were only the incidents serious enough to require admission to medical centers. Why do people put themselves in constant danger because of this behavior? You would think that no phone is that important. It turns out that there are four factors at play which keep our eyes fixed on these screens: boredom, anxiety, accessibility and lack of metacognition. Boredom decreases when people switch between tasks and information sources. That’s particularly true if you go from a work-related information stream to an “entertainment-related” one, like Facebook or YouTube. Professor Leo Yeykelis proved this with his colleagues in a 2014 study at Stanford University. They equipped students with wrist sensors that used galvanic skin response (GSR) to monitor their arousal level while working on their computers at home. The researchers found that there was an observable increase in their arousal level just before they switched between tasks. It was most noticeable when they switched from work to entertainment-related tasks. Anxiety levels also decrease when we change information feeds. We feel anxiety if we're unable to check our smartphones or social media. This has been termed FOMO or “fear of missing out,” and it can be observed in young adults if they go 15 minutes without looking at their smart devices. It’s this self-derived anxiety which causes us to interrupt ourselves. Access to technology is nowadays more or less a given in most parts of the world. It’s like constantly having access to a never-ending box of chocolates – easy to overdo it. Smartphones, for example, are always connected to the internet, so email and the temptations of social media are just a finger tap away. Finally, there’s metacognition or being aware of what your brain is up to. If you’re self-aware that you’re switching tasks, you’re less likely to become distracted. However, if you lack metacognition, then you’ll find it pretty hard to resist looking at your smartphone. All this shows that we just don’t have the tools to confront the ever-expanding cornucopia of temptation that modern technology represents. We can’t seem to stop ourselves getting distracted. So what are we going to do about it? There are two ways to improve your cognitive control. You can either alter your brain, or you can change your behavior. In this blink, we’ll explore the former. Don’t worry: modifying your brain does not involve using surgical tools! The brain is plastic, which means it's able to constantly change its own structure, physiology and chemistry. Consequently, many scientists think the brain’s cognitive control can be enhanced. There are several ways to change your brain. The most effective method for both children and adults is also the simplest: physical exercise. It’s well known that exercise will improve physical and mental health, but it’s also been shown to induce neural changes that boost cognitive control. A 2009 study published in Pediatrics showed that physically-fit children exhibit better cognitive control than those who are less fit. The children were connected to a virtual reality environment and placed on a treadmill. They were instructed to cross a virtual street within the environment either while chatting on the phone or listening to music. The results showed that the fitter children were less distracted. Another way to modify the brain is through cognitive exercises, otherwise known as brain training. There are many types. Just like toning your body at the gym, if there’s going to be a noticeable effect, you’ll have to repeat the exercises regularly and adapt as you improve. As you get better, the exercises have to get harder. In 1998, an experiment called the ACTIVE trial was conducted. The idea was to examine if attention – one of the brain’s major cognitive-control abilities – would improve in older adults when compared to a control group if they underwent cognitive training. The results were astounding. Even ten years later in follow-up tests, the participants reported that they had fewer difficulties in their daily lives compared to the control group. Incredibly, they even caused 50 percent fewer traffic collisions. Cognitive-control improvements can also be achieved by modifying our behavior. However, there’s no need to do a full-scale “digital detox” and delete Facebook or Twitter, or even cut yourself off from the internet altogether unless you feel you’re addicted. Just a little less should do it. The trick is to depress interference by increasing metacognition while decreasing boredom, anxiety and access to technology. That’s to say, the four factors we looked at earlier. The most noticeable effects occur when we look at the impact of reducing interference for car drivers. It’s possible to increase metacognition if you familiarize yourself with the well-documented research which demonstrates the danger of texting and driving simultaneously. This awareness will discourage you from doing it yourself. For instance, a study that might help you increase your metacognition was published by the US National Safety Council. This found that using mobile phones while driving caused 23 percent of all car crashes nationwide. That also explains why most states have banned the practice. You might begin by reducing access to technology. Sure, you could lock your phone in the trunk, but there are also plenty of apps like DriveOFF and DriveMode that will block incoming texts, emails and phone calls while you drive. If you start getting bored while driving, there’s no need to reach for your phone. Chat with your passengers, fire up an audiobook, podcast or some music. According to a recent study by David Strayer, a professor at the University of Utah, each of these activities is far less distracting for drivers than talking on the phone. Finally, you can lower your anxiety by forewarning colleagues, friends and family of your regular commute time. That way they won’t call you, and you’ll have no reason to fear you’re missing a phone call or a text. Alternatively, an app like Live2Txt will reply automatically to people trying to get hold of you and let them know you’re driving and will get back to them shortly. Now that we know how to deal with interference while driving, let’s look at doing the same while socializing. If you ever pop your head into a social environment like a café or restaurant, then you’re sure to see people fiddling with their phones when they’re meant to be chatting with the people right in front of them. Even in these social situations, interference seemingly can’t be avoided. However, with a little bit of effort, you can combat that. Once more, you have to target metacognition, boredom, anxiety and access to technology. Let’s start with metacognition. You should be aware that mobile devices ruin relationships. A 2013 study at the University of Essex showed that the mere fact that a phone was in the room was enough for two people to feel less close and less empathetic during conversation. The phone didn’t even have to be picked up or checked. Its presence reduced mutual trust and understanding. Now, do you feel like you should put your phone away for a bit? The most effective way to reduce accessibility to mobile devices is to simply put them down and not use them. Less drastically, you could make your bedroom or dining area “technology-free zones.” It’s oh-so-easy to reach for your phone when you’re bored. This means you should reduce your boredom – try to actively make sure that everyone is engaged in the conversation you’re having. That way, you won’t miss out on anything interesting or titillating that gets brought up – even at family dinner time! Finally, just as when you’re commuting, telling people your schedule will reduce your anxiety that you might be missing out. If they know that you eat between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., they’ll just call you later or earlier. There's really nothing to fear. There’s no doubt that modern technology can help us in our lives. But too much can be detrimental. Use its power in moderation and, as the old saying goes, “nothing in excess!\" The key message in this book: The human brain is capable of some astonishing feats. But its evolutionary history has left it susceptible to distractions and interruptions. Such interference stops us reaching our goals as quickly and efficiently as we would like. Luckily, there are ways to train your brain and improve your cognitive control. Actionable advice: Meditate! It’s not only physical and cognitive exercises that help you mitigate the brain’s cognitive limitations. Meditation has been proven to improve cognitive control. You might want to consider making time for mediation on a regular basis. Don’t know what to do?

And how many apps and programs do you run on them? If you’re anything like the millions of people who spend a sizeable part of their day toggling between social media platforms, multiple browser tabs, email and instant messaging services the answer is likely to be a fair few! Being a digital native – someone raised in the age of digital technology and familiar from an early age with the internet and computers – is hard work. There’s so much data continually pinging into our literal and metaphorical inboxes that it’s difficult to block out what we don’t need and concentrate on the task at hand. So how can we overcome digital distractions? These blinks are here to help. Deploying examples drawn from experimental neuroscience research, psychology and Buddhist philosophy, they suggest ways in which we can learn to be more mindful, less distracted and enjoy the moments that matter most of all. In these blinks, you’ll find out how a daily stroll helped Darwin write 18 books and essays; the difference between true multitasking and randomly switching between tasks; and why meditation can boost your memory and attention span. The internet is at the heart of our lives today. According to Nielsen and the Pew Research Center, the average American spends around 60 hours online every month. Digital devices open up new worlds, but this new age of connectivity can come at a cost. As we are ever more reliant on our devices, we run the risk of becoming “addicted to the internet.” If that sounds like an exaggeration, take a look at a study carried out by researchers at the University of Maryland, who asked students from ten different countries to spend a day offline and report their experiences. The results were, to put it mildly, alarming. The language the students used recalled substance addiction. One participant from the United Kingdom said they “craved” their devices, while an American student added that he “felt like a drug addict, tweaking for a taste of information.” Another British student flatly admitted his addiction: “I don’t need alcohol, cocaine or any other derailing form of social depravity,” he said. “Media is my drug; without it I was lost.” Another study, conducted in a Boston hospital, echoed these findings. Two out of three participants experienced phantom cell phone vibrations – the uncanny sensation that your phone is ringing when it isn’t. Scientists define this phenomenon as part of an addiction to the internet. Someone who uses their phone all the time is familiar with the sensation of it vibrating on their skin – when their clothes rub against them, or they feel a small muscle spasm, they immediately assume that it’s the all too familiar sensation of their vibrating phone. But it doesn’t have to be like this – technology can work as an extension of ourselves when we integrate it into a flowing relationship. The idea of “flow” was first coined by the Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. It refers to the way in which we experience the world when deeply engrossed in a task. The author provides a good example of this – having practiced touch-typing as a child for over a decade, he can now type at least 70 words a minute with his eyes closed. Even when away from his computer, he is able to bring up an imaginary keyboard in his mind’s eye  – a useful trick for when his children ask him how to spell a word! Addiction is a different experience altogether. When we’re addicted to the internet, we become reliant on it. The author’s example shows what can happen when we are discerning with our use of technology, using it as a helpful tool rather than letting ourselves become slaves to our digital devices. Imagine sitting in front of your computer – you’re in the middle of writing an important email when your phone buzzes. You stop typing to reply to the message. Where were you? Oh, right, there was that interesting article you’d been meaning to read… Unsurprisingly, this isn’t the best way to get things done! That’s because this isn’t multitasking, it’s switch-tasking. So what’s the difference? Monica Smith, a professor at UCLA, defines the former as multiple activities undertaken with a common aim in mind. Say you’ve invited some friends over for a dinner party – you’ll have to keep track of several things at once: Which ingredients you want, where to purchase them, how to prepare everything and the timing of it all. To pull off a successful dinner, you need to be a true multitasker. Switch-tasking also involves multiple activities, but there’s no common focus holding them together. You’re doing lots of different, unrelated things at once. To get the gist of it, take this three-step experiment carried out by Megan Jones, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Jones first asked the author to count from one to ten as quickly as he could. Easy, right? She then had him recite the alphabet from A to J. Again, hardly the most demanding task. In fact, both were completed in one-and-a-half seconds. But what happens when you add random switching into the mix? When Jones asked the author to alternate numbers and letters – “One, A, Two, B” and so on – he struggled. Switching back and forth between the two series made everything much more complicated. It now took three times as long to complete. This is a great illustration of the way switch-tasking makes us both less efficient and more likely to make mistakes. As anyone who’s ever sat in front of a computer toggling between multiple tabs knows, switch-tasking is incredibly common. So what’s the answer? One solution is Zenware – these are programs that block out distractions and facilitate efficient multitasking – with WriteRoom being one example of just how effective Zenware can be. Developer Jesse Grosjean started designing the app after noticing how much time writers spent fiddling around with the layout of their documents – a form of procrastination that distracted them from the actual task at hand – writing. His solution was as simple as it was elegant – by simply removing all the buttons for adjusting things like margins, line spacing and fonts, the user is presented with a full-screen page without any formatting options – enabling writers to focus on what’s important. Zenware isn’t the only – or even the best – solution being developed in the war on distraction. Just ask Damchoe Wangmo; one of the 5000 students at the Buddhist Namdroling Monastery in southwest India. Like many Buddhists, Wangmo doesn’t think distraction is caused by technology, so much as a lack of mindfulness. It’s an argument echoed by Bhikkhu Samahita, a former professor of bioinformatics at the Technical University of Denmark, who now lives as a monk in Sri Lanka. His recipe for mindfulness is a strict one: He sleeps four hours each night and spends eight hours meditating every day. Bhikkhu defines mindfulness as the state of being attuned to your thoughts and actions in the present moment. Because of his focus on mindfulness, Bhikkhu can make use of technology without becoming dependent on it. That’s why he’s able to spend up to five hours a day publishing posts on his website What Buddha Said, replying to followers on Twitter and engaging in online debates without ever craving more. Disconnecting is as easy as pie. This echoes the views of other Buddhists – that distraction isn’t a product of the external world, but the reflection of an inner state. If you start out on a task with a distracted mind, you’re much more likely to be distracted when your phone buzzes. But neither phones nor the internet are really the cause of your distraction – it’s your state of mind. Mindfulness — especially through meditation —  can help you get into a calm and focused state of mind. This was shown in an experiment carried out by Richard Davidson, a professor of neuroscience interested in long-term changes to the structure of the brain, after a chance encounter with the Dalai Lama. Davidson asked if he could study the effects of meditation on the brains of monks. Once the Dalai Lama agreed, Davidson and his colleague Antoine Lutz connected several monks to electroencephalogram monitors while they meditated. One monk, called Matthieu Ricard, was asked to meditate on unconditional love. The results were stunning: the increase in activity in the part of the brain associated with compassion was so dramatic that the two scientists initially suspected a technical error. However, the results were accurate. Years of disciplined meditation meant that these monks showed greater levels of activity in the parts of the brain responsible for compassion, memory and attention! Why have computers become so distracting? Their affordability and rapidly increasing power means they’ve become a ubiquitous presence in our lives. But there’s more to it than that. Professors Byron Reeves and Clifford Nass of Stanford University claim that computers are now so embedded in everyday life that we’re increasingly treating them like humans! That’s because we feel more intimately connected to computers that are interactive and receptive. Take a social experiment recently conducted by Jeremy Bailenson, the director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Laboratory, and graduate student Nick Yee. The pair used virtual reality to create highly realistic avatars and asked participants to listen to them as they gave a four-minute speech. During the talk, some of the avatars regularly mirrored the body language and facial expressions of their listeners, while others were less responsive. When Bailenson and Yee asked the participants whether they found the more interactive avatars more persuasive and attractive than the less interactive ones, the answer was a resounding “yes.” This suggests that we have a more profound connection with computers when they’re more responsive and interactive. What’s more, this connection could be utilized to help us reach our goals. Another experiment was carried out by Jesse Fox, a professor at Ohio State University. Fox wanted to know what effect virtual reality avatars might have on people’s motivation to pursue long-term goals. Could they help us overcome the hurdles that prevent us from beginning an exercise regimen, for example? Fox designed two avatars and placed them in a room with fitness equipment. The first avatar was generic in its appearance, while the second resembled the participants in the study. One group of participants saw the first avatar; the other the one that looked like them. What both avatars had in common was a set of both negative and positive reinforcements – they started gaining weight if the participants stood around, and shedding pounds as they began exercising. The result? On average, the participants who interacted with personalized avatars worked out a full hour longer than those who interacted with their generic counterparts. So it’s not all about distraction after all! Computers also motivate us to overcome obstacles and begin working on long-term goals, especially when they can help us visualize the results of our efforts. Our need for mindfulness will only increase as computers come to play an ever-more important role in our lives. So where do we find respite from the distractions of busy everyday life? There’s a whole range of options out there; from yoga to the latest app promising peace of mind. But there’s another answer, and it’s something we do every day – walking! That’s because taking a stroll is an excellent stimulant to thought. Take Charles Darwin. In 1842, the Darwin family moved into their new home – named Down House – in the village of Bromley, on the outskirts of London. The location had been carefully chosen – it was close enough to the city to be convenient, but distant enough to keep distractions at arm’s length. One of the house’s most distinctive features was the Sandwalk – a quarter-mile gravel path constructed by Darwin shortly after the family had settled in. It soon became known as Darwin’s “thinking path.” For almost forty years, the biologist would take a daily walk along the path, pondering the scientific conundrums he was currently working on. The historian James Moore, a professor at the Open University, claims that the Sandwalk was the most important feature of Darwin’s home. The results certainly speak for themselves – Darwin published 18 books and monographs during his time at Down House! So why is walking so effective? Well, it’s a great way of letting your mind wander freely, as it’s both a break from your usual routine and an activity that doesn’t require your undivided attention. But as the Sandwalk suggests, activities conducive to thought and contemplation can be actively encouraged. Architecture that enables this is called contemplative design.  There are a couple of criteria that a design needs to meet to be considered an example of contemplative design. Firstly, it should be fascinating. It should stimulate your imagination, but not to the extent that it demands your full attention. Another important feature is that it encourages a sense of being away. The best contemplative design can offer respite from your everyday workplace. Blocking out the outside world can be as simple as planting high hedges alongside a path – the solution Darwin came up with for his Sandwalk. Thirdly, there is the criterion of extent. Your sanctuary should be large enough for it to feel like an entire world. Lastly, you should pay attention to compatibility. That means it should be simple to navigate. Darwin’s Sandwalk, for example, had narrow, intuitively laid-out paths. If you’re anything like the millions of us who spend more than eight hours a day toggling between social media messages and work emails, you might want to consider taking the Digital Sabbath. First used by Silicon Valley-based psychologist Anne Dilenschneider, the concept refers to the practice of taking a break from the internet and disconnecting your devices. The idea is both simple and effective. By tuning out the background noise that surrounds us online, we create more space for greater meaning in our lives. If you’re skeptical, just ask the self-avowed Digital Sabbatarian and former social media junkie, Shay Colson. Shay decided to take an extended break from the online world during his month-long honeymoon in Bali. The Colsons took an old-school approach to their romantic break – ditching internet access, Wikipedia and QR codes, and embracing guidebooks, printed tickets and paper reservation slips. The results were radical. Rather than obsessively taking photographs to upload onto social media platforms, Shay found himself present in the moment, enjoying the time he was spending with his new wife. But that doesn’t mean you need to go full cold turkey. Your best bet is to identify which sites, apps, and devices you find most addictive and distracting and concentrate on limiting your access to those. That’s what Tesla Motors engineer David Wuertele did after he noticed how his habit of carrying a tablet around with him was damaging his relationship with his young son. His moment of revelation came in a park one Saturday. His son had asked him if they could go somewhere, and rather than giving him his full attention, Wuertele found himself telling his son to wait until he’d finished the article he was reading. Worried that this would damage their relationship, Wuertele made the choice to always leave his tablet at home, and switch off his cellphone when he spent time with his son. That freed up his attention and allowed him to be present for the most important moments of his childhood. You don’t have to renounce the internet and connectivity – all that’s required is taking some time out. After all, distraction is a choice. The key message in this book: It’s easy to blame technology for distracting us from our work and our families, but distraction goes deeper than the internet or the latest app – it’s a state of mind. If we start a task without already being in the right mindset, the smallest things – the ping of an email landing in our inbox, or the vibration of our phones – can break our concentration. Attentiveness to the task at hand is an ability honed over time by both willpower and mindfulness.  Actionable advice: Identify your main digital enemies. Take a moment to think about an average workday. What was it that last distracted you from a task? Chances are that you already know how to ignore some distractions, while other things – be it Twitter or your smartphone – can completely derail your concentration. Once you’ve isolated the principal offenders, take action to limit your access to those. That can be as simple as switching a device off for a period or just leaving it at home. You may even want to download special software that helps you block out background noise, or remove the formatting options on a word processing document.

It’s entirely imaginable today that robots with all manner of human traits could be developed, capable of displaying empathy, speech cognition and a high level of intelligence. If the robots are compliant, this could be very practical, such as for the many single people in the world who need a steady and reliable partner to live with. But the robots could also decide to take over and make humans into slaves. Leaving aside science fiction, technology and machines have thus far not wreaked havoc on Earth; on the contrary, mechanization has meant that human beings have to work less and less, leaving them to be creative, productive or just lazy. This tendency is bound to continue as technology progresses, so let’s consider the positive and negative aspects that this increase in AI has in store for us. In these blinks, you will learn why there are so many more consultants than carpenters these days; how technology is evolving to master complex human skills; and why you may be getting a paycheck without working in the near future. When machines and factories began to appear in nineteenth-century Victorian England, many people were critical of this new development. Charles Dickens, in particular, worried about the effect machinery would have on England’s working-class laborers, and expressed these concerns in his books. Even then, people were worried about losing their jobs to new technology. But as mass production took over during the Industrial Revolution, there was no stopping the progress made. Actually, it wasn’t the machines that brought about this change so much as the steam engines that were powering them. People were already familiar with machines powered by wind and water, as these had been around since medieval times. What really fueled the Industrial Revolution was the fact that new machines along assembly lines were harnessing the power of Thomas Newcomen’s steam engine. Invented in 1712, the steam engine accelerated the onset of the industrial age and was far more powerful than any of the water- or air-powered contraptions that preceded it. With machines taking over a large portion of the labor, a significant percentage of the population could now focus on other things – and it was this extra time that would lead to the Information Revolution. As time went on, machines became increasingly efficient and less manual work was needed on the assembly line. As a result, workers turned their attention to the service industry. Prior to 1940, only half of America’s gross domestic product (GDP) came from the service industry, but by 1950, this industry was employing over half of the nation’s workforce. This shift, from industry and agriculture to service, marked the start of the Information Revolution, an era that would focus on producing knowledge and information rather than raw materials. Since the Information Revolution is still ongoing, we can’t be certain of its overall consequences; in fact, it remains difficult to speculate as to what our workforce will look like in the future. But before looking ahead, let’s first take a closer look at how we got to where we are today. Are you familiar with the term Luddite? You might be if you prefer to live a life free of technology. But do you know the origins of the name? As the story goes, in 1779, a textile worker by the name of Ned Ludd revolted after being whipped by his employer. For Ned, it was the final straw, and he smashed his new mechanical knitting machine in protest. The story lingered in the public imagination, and when textile workers in nineteenth-century England faced further mechanization of their profession, they united in protest over the threat to their livelihood, calling themselves Luddites. And much like the Ned Ludd story, the workers smashed the new weaving machines in defiance. But is technology really to blame? When we look at the evidence, we can see that machinery generally increases a nation’s wealth while the resilient job market adapts. Since machines don’t need to sleep and don’t require wages or benefits, they make production cheaper and faster. And with more products being made, a higher demand can be met, which results in more wealth and more jobs in the long run. So it’s shortsighted to assume that automation automatically leads to unemployment. After all, there isn’t a fixed amount of jobs to be had or work to do. Thus far, the general rule has been that when societies and companies innovate and become more prosperous, new jobs are created. Today, more machines than ever are being used. And at the same time, humans are working as much as we ever have, because machines allow us to be more productive and accomplish new and exciting tasks. In 2015, the financial consulting firm, Deloitte, studied employment trends dating back to 1871 and found that machines have indeed generated more jobs – primarily due to the automation of the agriculture industry and laundry-related professions. Workers in these sectors were suddenly freed up to fill the jobs of the expanding service industry, including teachers and nurses. Between 1992 and 2014, the number of teaching and nursing jobs in the United States increased by six and nine percent, respectively. So far, machines have done more good than harm to the job market, so you might think that improving machines through artificial intelligence (AI) would make things even better, right? Not so fast. As machines get smarter and smarter, in large part thanks to AI developments such as deep learning, it means they’ll eventually be able to replace the very jobs in the service sector that we’ve come to rely on. Deep learning is a process wherein a machine is fed different data sets and uses algorithms to make predictions and draw future conclusions based on the results of those predictions. So, in a sense, the machine is learning. And the more data the machine is given, the more comparisons the machine can make and the more intelligent it becomes. This is how machines are learning to perfect a range of human skills like speech and image recognition. In 2012, computer scientist and cognitive psychologist Geoff Hinton led a team to victory in an AI image recognition contest. Through deep learning, their computer recognized the most images, including clouds, cats and dogs. This is the kind of knowledge that will enable machines to make informed decisions and perform human tasks, making them much cheaper and efficient workers than humans. And some jobs in the service sector are already at risk of becoming automated. The software program, Quill, is automating some of the more basic jobs in the journalism sector by writing Associated Press articles on sports and financial news. Developed in 2010 by Narrative Science, Quill can analyze data and pick out the most relevant details for an article. It can then quickly generate a structure for the article and use its language-generation software to compose the necessary sentences. This shows us that even complex jobs requiring cognitive analysis can either be partly or completely performed by machines. And once one company starts using them, other companies will be forced to follow their lead or else fall behind their competition. Once a new technology becomes readily available, rapid change inevitably follows. Think back to how quickly people switched to digital cameras, or how typewriters became obsolete virtually overnight. With constant advancements being made in AI, we’re guaranteed to see more rapid change happen in the near future, such as the proliferation of self-driving cars. A renowned competition for self-driving cars in the United States is the DARPA Grand Challenge, and in 2004, the winner was Sandstorm, a converted Humvee that only made it seven miles before getting stuck on a rock. But a lot has changed since then: the self-driving cars that Google has designed for Lexus and Chrysler have already logged over a million miles on California roads – and there hasn’t been a significant setback yet. Experts are predicting that public roads will be taken over by self-driving cars by the year 2041. This means that driving tests will become obsolete, as will most chauffeur and commercial driving jobs. With fewer accidents on the road, there will be a drastically reduced demand for mechanics and hardly any need for car insurance. So when can you expect to get your first self-driving car? Chris Urmson, the head of Google’s automated driving project predicts that the general public should have the option of driving hands-free by 2020. Another industry that’s especially vulnerable to automation is the healthcare sector. In fact, the first caregiving robot is already being used in Japan. Both the robot and its parent company are called PARO, and the robot itself looks like a small seal, complete with fur and big eyes. Animal therapy has become quite popular recently, as patients exposed to cuddly creatures get some much-needed cheer to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. And PARO allows more patients to experience these benefits by reaching those who don’t have access to a real animal. The author believes that by 2041, we’ll all have access to devices that will constantly monitor our vital statistics. As a result, we’ll see a dramatic decline in the demand for doctors and nurses, as their basic functions will be automated. There are going to be a number of challenges facing our society in the future, not the least of which will be the economic impact that will accompany a surge in joblessness. When large numbers of people suddenly become unemployed, there will be a subsequent period of economic contraction that could bring society to a grinding halt. When we put the AI technology to use, productivity will increase and the prices of goods and services will drop so that people continue buying. But the initial positive effect of these changes will eventually level off, and will be replaced by an economic contraction caused by so many unemployed people. We’ve seen this happen in Greece, where 46.5 percent of the country’s young people are unemployed. While family members are able to provide a temporary safety net for relatives in situations like Greece’s, there’s no precedent for the sprawling unemployment that will happen in the future. It will cut across all ages, classes and demographics, so there’s no safety net big enough to prevent the economy from deteriorating under such stress. Another issue is the disparity between classes, which could lead to some people not being able to afford access to certain technologies and getting left behind. While technology changes quickly, there’s still a lengthy period before new products become affordable to the general public. So, let’s say implants emerge that allow wealthy people to enhance their bodies and minds far beyond what’s possible today. This could make the social divide even worse than it is today by making the lives of the wealthy so drastically different that their access to technology makes them “superior” beings. We’ll need to work together if we’re going to overcome future challenges, and in the final blink we’ll look at how we might just persevere. How would you feel about making money and not having to work? It might sound like a dream, but it could soon be a reality for many of us. This concept is known as universal basic income and it will be a necessity in a future where most jobs can be automated. After all, we’ll still need an income, even when sophisticated AI is taking care of the tasks that keep services functioning. A universal basic income allows a fixed amount to be distributed to all citizens, either unconditionally or through what’s known as a negative income tax, a method that works by providing a certain amount of money to help you reach a set figure. This model of basic income welfare has already been tested in some areas, with the biggest experiment taking place during the 1970s, in the Canadian town of Dauphin. The Canadian government determined that every family would receive a minimum amount of money each year, with no strings attached. Adjusted for inflation, they decided this amount would be $16,000 Canadian. So if a family’s normal income dropped below that amount, the government would cover the difference. Between 1974 and 1976, 10,000 citizens benefitted from the program, and despite worries that it would lead to voluntary unemployment, only mothers with newborns and teenagers quit working altogether. Universal basic income should allow for more artistic endeavors, but it could also lead to depression. A job is what gives meaning to many people’s lives, and we can safely predict that around ten percent of the population will suffer psychologically from being unemployed. They’ll either sink into a depression or escape into the world of virtual reality entertainment. But the majority of the population will find healthy endeavors to bring joy to their lives, such as writing, playing sports or discovering other creative and artistic pursuits. If we’re going to make this happen, we’ll need to be prepared, with strategies and structures in place to allow for a smooth economic transition and to avoid some of the biggest dangers we’re sure to face. The key message in this book: Unlike previous changes in society, the information revolution will end up having a major impact on employment, making many of the jobs we perform today largely unnecessary. In order to prevent a major catastrophe, we need to plan ahead for this inevitability and find a way to organize a successful society that will continue to function in the absence of work as we know it today.

Indeed, it’s a veritable universe of information – an exciting frontier open to all. Or at least that’s what we’re led to believe. In reality, though, our access to this digital cosmos is closely monitored, our every click subtly guided. We think we’re surveying the heavens, but, more often than not, we’re never able to see much farther than our own backyard. How did our view become so limited? Well, internet giants like Google, Facebook and YouTube have created an individualized web for us. By using personalization and filters, such companies ensure that we never get the full picture – that we’re always confined to our own digital bubble. In these blinks, you’ll discover how we get stuck in a digital bubble to begin with. You’ll learn how we shape these bubbles and how they shape us, too. You’ll also learn how much data there is; what Google knows about you; and why the internet affirms your beliefs. It’s not unusual to feel overwhelmed by the seeming infiniteness of the internet. After all, there is a mind-boggling amount of data out there. Here are some numbers that’ll give you a sense of what’s going on: Over the course of a typical day, 900,000 blog posts are created, 50 million tweets are sent, 60 million updates are logged on Facebook and 210 billion (that’s right, billion!) emails are sent. And this is just the tip of the internet iceberg. If that’s still difficult to comprehend, here’s another way of looking at it. As the former CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, puts it: To record and store the two thousand years of human communication prior to 2003, one would need five billion gigabytes of space. Yet this amount of storage would only hold two days of communication in 2011. This overwhelming amount of data is the main reason people have embraced the personalization of the internet. Filters such as the recommendation features that many sites offer simply make the internet a more navigable place. Media analyst Steve Rubel even has a term for what people experience when faced with the unfiltered vastness of the internet: the attention crash. Today, it’s so easy and cheap for people all around the world to communicate and create content that there’s no way to catch it all. People jump from an email to a YouTube clip to a news site and so on without any focus or capacity to identify what’s relevant. This is why the giants of the internet – companies such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Amazon – started offering personalized filters that uniquely match results with a person’s individual tastes and preferences. With these filters in place, scrolling through the data becomes less overwhelming and finding and identifying relevant information is a whole lot simpler and faster. Imagine if Netflix, Amazon or iTunes offered no personalization features. You’d have to scroll through hundreds of thousands of titles, categorized alphabetically or by genre alone, making it the type of daunting task that you’d be loath to undertake at all. So, obviously, personalization has some major advantages. But there’s also a dark side that involves an ongoing battle for individual information. The distressing problem with the personalization of the internet is this: relevant results rely on personal information – the more personal the better. This means that corporations like Google are out to learn everything about you. Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, want to provide people with the best, most tailored search results, which means using “smart” algorithms than don’t rely on keywords alone. An important part of Google’s algorithms are links. A site is considered more relevant when other sites link to it. And if these “relevant” sites link to other sites, those sites will also be considered more important, and so on. But to provide accurate and personalized results, Google needs as much data as it can get its hands on. So the company stores and monitors each and every datum. After every Google search, they track which results the user is offered as well as the “click signals” – that is, which websites the user ended up clicking through to. Google’s ability to collect information received a significant boost in 2004, when they began offering personal services such as Gmail, services that require the user to log in. This provided Google with even more detailed knowledge about people’s personal preferences, because it could now cross-reference personal data, such as age and location, in combination with each person’s usual link-clicking behavior. With this new info in hand, Google’s algorithms became more refined and its search engine results provided more personalized and tailored results. Both Google and Facebook are leading the way in collecting our personal data. It’s believed that for approximately 96 percent of all US households, Google has an average of 1,500 pieces of information. This information could range from the names of your relatives and friends to whether you are left- or right-handed. Facebook also continues to collect vast amounts of personal and detailed information, such as who you date, where you go to eat, where you work and the things you “like.” All the information that is freely deposited on news feeds is ultimately added to Facebook’s growing treasure trove of data. The New York Times once ruled the advertising game. If you wanted to reach the best and brightest minds, you would pay whatever the New York Times was charging for ad space. That’s because the best and brightest relied on the Times for their news. Of course, this is no longer the case. Most of us know that the internet has democratized the way we get our news – and we’d probably be tempted to say that this development is a good thing. Take the scandal surrounding former CBS anchorman Dan Rather, for instance. In 2004, during George W. Bush’s presidential campaign, CBS News announced that they possessed a document which allegedly proved that Bush had lied about his military record. Dan Rather, who was covering the campaign, defended the document. Shortly before the election, however, a conservative activist posted in a right-wing forum that the document was inauthentic. The discussion quickly spread to other online communities, and the verdict came down a few days later: the document was indeed inauthentic. CBS issued an apology – but Dan Rather retired soon thereafter. Today, internet users and blog communities have a major voice in journalism, a voice that is getting more and more audible. In the best cases, this voice serves as check on the most prominent publishers and news broadcasters. But the democratization of the news has gone hand in hand with its mechanization and personalization. The internet provides access to massive amounts of news, so whether you’re interested in sports or politics, you can fire up your browser and find more information than could possibly fit into one newspaper. This is both terrific and troublesome because the overwhelming amount of news requires some level of filtration. Since human curators are expensive, it’s left up to some kind of software code to recommend news for our consumption. And since your personal information will reveal you to be either a liberal or a conservative thinker, this software code will filter out articles that might challenge your point of view. This is where we see how the personalization of the internet becomes less about recommending a movie you might like and more about monitoring what news you are exposed to. And it was this shift that created the filter bubble. As we’ll find out in the next blink, this bubble can even affect how we learn. The filter bubble is what we can call our own personalized internet environment, and it impacts our relationship with the world in two important ways. First of all, since the filter bubble does its best to present you with information that aligns with your personal tastes and beliefs, you’ll likely become very confident that those beliefs are right. This is known as confirmation bias, and it happens when you believe something – that the earth is flat, for instance, or that climate change is a government conspiracy – and then deny everything that doesn’t reinforce that belief. As you can imagine, confirmation bias proliferates when everyone is living in their own filter bubble. It’s natural, of course, for people to want to reinforce their personal beliefs; however, an issue shouldn’t be considered settled until both sides of the argument have been heard, which happens less and less when the content people see is always tailored to support their beliefs. This bubble also affects our curiosity, which is vital to how we grow and learn. The psychologist George Loewenstein points to the “information gap” as the reason humans become curious. An information gap is any barrier that stands between us and a piece of information, like the wrapping paper on a present. It makes us curious and excited – ready to tear off the paper and find out what’s hidden beneath. But the filter bubble removes the information gap by hiding the fact that anything is being filtered to begin with. Since each search turns up an abundance of information, you think you’re getting an accurate picture of what’s going on in the world, even though each search makes an encounter with anything unfamiliar or challenging less likely. And, of course, it’s challenging information – things we don’t fully understand – that spark our curiosity. So how can we learn new things if we’re living in a filter bubble? You might have always thought that the internet is a one-way street – information flows into your mind from the web. But, as you’ve already learned, things are much more complex than that. To fully understand the relationship between you and the internet, you should first know that you help shape the way the internet works. The internet wants to provide a personalized experience, so it needs to know who you are. It does this through the algorithms that are programmed within it, which are designed to figure out what you like based on information such as the sites you visit, the links you follow and the things you share. This is the data that will determine what content you are then exposed to. As you provide companies like Google and Facebook with more data, they in turn refine the content that is provided to you. But since you’re the one providing the data, you’re also the one shaping the internet you interact with.   And remember: the internet also shapes you. As the content you’re exposed to becomes more personalized, the array of topics and ideas you’re exposed to becomes more limited, thereby influencing your perception and your identity. Self-fulfilling prophecies occur by creating a reinforcing loop between belief and behavior. The internet, by creating a you loop, essentially creates self-fulfilling identities. The “you loop” starts when Facebook and Google get their initial idea of who you are from limited data removed from any context. This is Google’s theory of you, and it might be based on your general interest in science and a couple movies you liked. Of course, it is nothing like the real you, since your identity is much more than a taste for science and a handful of films. Nevertheless, they’ll use this information to suggest specific internet communities as well as news and ads that align with these highly specific aspects of your identity. And there’s a good chance that you’ll end up clicking on one of these things and confirming Google’s theory, thereby prompting more science-related content. In this way, the internet begins subtly molding your personality. If you are on Facebook, you’re probably familiar with the upsetting experience of being tagged in an embarrassing photo that was taken during one of your less-than-shining moments. In these cases, the best you can do is untag the photo, cross your fingers and hope that it never resurfaces. But face recognition technology is on the rise right alongside personalization, and it will only add to the difficulty of protecting your privacy. As uneasy as it might make you feel, it is possible that anyone with a computer will one day be able to search the internet for a face just as easily as they can search for a name. Once face recognition becomes mainstream, there’s little hope of protecting your privacy. You can say no to photos and do all the untagging you want, but your face can still pop up in a search, even if you were just walking along and got caught in the background of someone else’s selfie. For companies and advertisers, your location is just one more important piece of data, and in some places face recognition is already transforming the ads in public spaces. The idea of walking along and watching as all the ads on billboards target you might sound more suited to some dystopian science fiction movie, but, in Japan, this is already a reality. There’s a very special, and very personalized, billboard already being used in Tokyo. As you walk past it, it scans your face, looking for a match in its database of 10,000 pictures. As soon as it determines your gender and age, it’ll show ads tailored to that specific group. Indeed, we’re already living in a brave new world, and while there might be things that aren’t in our control, we should, at the very least, remember that the filter bubble is there – and try to step outside it whenever we can. The key message in this book: Despite appearances, the internet is far more diverse than you could ever imagine. But due to personalization and filtration, we miss out on valuable information that could inform us, spark our curiosity and help us grow as intelligent human beings. Instead, companies are focused on advertising and appealing to our personal tastes, so we end up trapped in a bubble that simply reinforces our previously established ideas of the world.

Not long ago, AI was largely considered the stuff of sci-fi, but it’s now clear that we’re not far from innovations like self-driving cars being the norm. As author Byron Reese describes, the world of automation will be a seismic shift for human history, on par with the invention of the wheel. As he puts it, we’ll be entering the Fourth Age. This comes with significant concerns about how things will change for humans. Reese also describes the different schools of thought on how disastrous or beneficial AI will be for us. While no one can claim to be a soothsayer with visions of what’s to come, we can gain a better understanding of the philosophies that influence the speculation, cautioning, and panicky editorials of the present. In these blinks you’ll find out which inventions have marked the first three ages in human history; how Plato is still influencing current debates; and the difference between “strong” and “weak” AI. You could reflect on human history, divide it up and categorize certain eras in any number of ways. One way would be with an eye toward innovation and technology. In this light, we can divide history into three key periods, or ages, with the first two going back to prehistoric times. The First Age is defined by the inventions of fire and language. This age is believed to have started around one hundred thousand years ago, when we were living as hunter-gatherers. The mastery of fire was a game-changer for humans. It not only provided us with light and warmth, it also increased our safety. But perhaps even more important, fire allowed us to cook food. Why was cooking so important? Well, since we remarkably use 20 percent of our caloric intake on brain functioning alone, cooking gave the evolution of our brain a huge boost. Cooking made it possible to eat a wider array of foods, and therefore consume many more calories. Thanks to cooking with fire, we could break down the starches and cellulose that had made many vegetables previously indigestible. Fire also broke down tough proteins, making them easier to chew, not to mention a lot tastier! Before fire, we had around the same amount of neurons as a gorilla or chimpanzee. Afterward, that number multiplied threefold. The second key technological advance of the First Age was language, since it allowed us to communicate more complex ideas and abstract concepts. Once we began to exchange information like this, we could cooperate more and expand our imaginations. With this, our ability to tell stories was born. In telling stories, we could finally express our inner world through the use of both words and symbols, as well as mix multiple ideas in order to suggest new and exciting futures. We can’t know for certain what the earliest languages sounded like, but we can use the languages that followed to guess what may have come before. Some theorize that today’s 445 languages, including English, Russian, German, Hindi and Punjabi, suggest that the earliest humans spoke a Proto-Indo-European language. Our days as hunter-gatherers ended around ten thousand years ago, when the Second Age began. This lifestyle shift was made possible by the invention of agriculture, which is the first key technology of the Second Age. Subsequently, the formation of cities and towns – where people could settle while they worked the land – became possible. This marked a considerable change from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which was nomadic and required people to travel vast distances in order to find food. Since fertile farmland requires a steady supply of water, early cities were often located near a freshwater source. In addition to homes, the settlements would usually expand to include markets and temples. The early city of Jericho, for example, formed alongside the river Jordan in modern day Palestine. Another important innovation that was born out of cities and agriculture was the division of labor. This was made possible once people joined cooperative communities, as they could now specialize in one or two specific tasks with the common goals of efficiency and economic prosperity. In modern day economics lingo, it’s considered one of the very rare “free lunches,” which means it allows people to work less yet still increase the society’s overall wealth. Imagine you’re responsible for everything you need to stay clothed, dry and fed: You must sew your own clothes, make your own tools, build shelter and get water and food. In his famous 1958 essay “I, Pencil,” economist Leonard Read describes a scenario wherein, even if a single person doesn’t have all the skills it takes to manufacture a pencil, hundreds of people can work together to bring the pencil into the world. Indeed, this is the beauty of the division of labor. There were, however, downsides: People became fiercely territorial about their land. After the advent of private property and the accumulation of wealth, inequality wasn’t far behind. Before long, it wasn’t just property and farmland that were privately owned, but livestock and stored grain as well. This eventually created what is known as an owning class. As wealth was passed down from one generation to the next, it led to the emergence of aristocracy and royalty. For a long time after this, there were two types of people in the world: those who ruled, and their subjects. The Third Age is now upon us. It all started around five thousand years ago when three new inventions came about: writing, wheels and money. Exactly where writing began is a topic of some debate. There are those who believe the honor belongs to the Sumerians, a civilization located in modern day Iraq. Others believe it was simultaneously developed by civilizations located in modern day Egypt and China. No matter where the first letter was written, the fact remains that it changed the course of human history by making it possible to record knowledge and disseminate it around the world. This shared knowledge was a catalyst for new ideas and allowed laws to be enacted. Alongside writing came the wheel, another transformative innovation that helped spread information, travel and commerce across the globe. Then there’s money, made possible in the Third Age by the development of metallurgy. This involved mixing tin and copper to make bronze. Together, the wheel, money and writing were just the ingredients humanity needed to create expansive empires and nation-states. With laws, money and better ground transportation, empires could gain and control widespread populations. Thus, the Third Age saw the rise of the first mega-civilizations, particularly in China, Mesopotamia and Central America. We can now fast forward five thousand years or so to the present and to the last big invention of the Third Age: the computer. From a philosophical standpoint, some believe the computer to be hugely important because it’s a computation machine and, so the theory goes, computation is at the heart of every mystery in life and the universe. Whether it’s consciousness, how the brain works, or how space and time function, some believe it all comes down to data processing. This brings us to the development of the ultimate computer and the rise of artificial intelligence, which, as we’ll see in the next blink, could very well bring us into the Fourth Age. We could define all artificial intelligence (AI) as a technology that reacts to its environment or the data it receives. But not all artificial intelligence is built the same. More precisely, there is a difference between narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI, also referred to as weak AI, is the only AI we currently know how to create. It propels everything from your Roomba vacuum cleaner to Apple’s Siri or a self-driving car. There are three ways narrow AI can work. The first is known as classic AI, since it was seen as the best method when AI was first developed. Let’s say we want to develop an AI machine to tell farmers the best time to plant their seeds. Under the classic AI model, this would involve a machine that takes into account every variable, such as soil type, weather conditions and crop variety, then weighs all the options and makes a suggestion. The second type of narrow AI is called an expert system. This machine would take into consideration the data from a hundred of the best farmers, including all the rules they use to grow the best crops. The farmer could then enter her own set of unique variables, which would be weighed against the expert rules in order to recommend the best option. The third variation of narrow AI is called machine learning. This would require the farmer to consistently give the machine all the data about everything she’s planted and what the conditions and results have been. Over time, the machine would use this data to build rules that would result in the maximum yield. Recently, the greatest advances have been made in the category of machine learning, thanks to the availability of large amounts of data and powerful computer algorithms. Finally, we have General AI, also known as strong AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI). General AI is potentially more versatile, adaptable and smarter than a human being. An AGI machine could face a completely new set of circumstances and know precisely how to respond. This might sound like some frightening sci-fi scenario, but at the moment this kind of technology doesn’t exist, nor is there any consensus on whether it’s even possible. So for now, we’ll stick to narrow AI and the implications it may have for the near future. Seeing how revolutionary the changes were following inventions like the wheel and the printing press, it’s safe to assume that Fourth Age technology will have a similar impact. But before we can determine how significant these changes surrounding AI machinery will be, we need to ask ourselves some fundamental philosophical questions. The first is whether we understand the universe in terms of monism or dualism. Monism is sometimes referred to as materialism or physicalism. It suggests that since everything in the universe is composed of atoms, everything is subject to the same set of physical laws. Even our dreams, feelings and identities are the result of molecular reactions and synapses in the brain. Under monism, everything can be broken down into the same basic building blocks, whether it’s an iPhone, a turnip or a human being. Dualism, on the other hand, sees the universe as composed of two interacting materials: physical and mental. According to noted dualist Plato, there is a world of ideas that contains things the physical world doesn’t, such as a perfect circle. As the theory goes, a truly perfect circle will never exist in the physical world, but such a thing can exist in the realm of thoughts and imagination. The second key question to ask yourself is whether you believe homo sapiens to be machines, animals or humans. Those who take the mechanistic view see people as driven by chemical reactions, and the mind and body as sustained by fuel in the form of food. According to this view, we’re machines, no different than a computer. Those who take the animalistic view see people inhabiting a biological world that is separate from machines. While machines can take on lifelike qualities, they’re fundamentally lifeless and lack the mysterious force that animates humans and other animals. Finally, those who take a humanistic view see consciousness and the soul as the major difference separating man from machine. As the Dalai Lama said, “Humans are not machines. We are something more. We have feeling and experience.” As we’ll see in the next blink, these philosophical questions are essential to the debate around AI and robots. With these three philosophical positions in mind, let’s take a look at some predictions about how robots and AI might affect our world -- especially in relation to our jobs. According to the first school of thought on the matter, based on mechanistic and monistic theory, AI will leave us with no jobs at all. If we’re no different than machines, and if we believe we’re made of entirely the same material as everything else in the universe, it stands to reason that a machine could do everything a human does. In fact, according to this line of thought, machines will undoubtedly become so sophisticated that they’ll do everything better than humans, whether it’s painting, writing a TV show or being president. In this scenario, if there are any jobs available to humans at all, it will likely be for sympathetic or nostalgic reasons. The second school of thought, associated with animalism and dualism theory, suggests that not all but most of our jobs will be taken by robots and AI. Since animals are fundamentally different than machines, there will be certain human jobs that machines can’t do. And since dualism accounts for a mental world that machines can’t access, this area will always be untouchable by machines and a safe haven for humans. Nevertheless, in this view, a far greater amount of jobs will be taken over by AI than will be created, especially in areas like retail, service and delivery. Even professional jobs requiring education, like doctors, paralegals and accountants, will be handled by AI. The only remaining jobs for humans will be ones that require emotional sensitivity and social skills. This brings us to the third and final school of thought, rooted in humanism and dualism, which suggests that we’ll still have plenty of jobs in a world of artificial intelligence. If humans are indeed different from both animals and machines, then logic would have it that we’ll always be more capable of doing certain jobs than robots. In this scenario, more jobs will be created as automation takes over many of the old ones, and the focus of these new jobs will be on tasks that are specific to human sensitivities. All of these scenarios are possible. However, as we’ll see in the final blink, there are reasons to be hopeful. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees about what the future has in store. But it’s important for us all to understand the different biases and perspectives that are shaping conversations about the Fourth Age. While some may be fearful about the future, there are also plenty of reasons to be hopeful. For starters, the conditions that bring about wars are decreasing, which suggests that large-scale wars could eventually be a thing of the past. The world is more connected than ever, with global computer networks, interdependent trade agreements and a financial system that is dependent upon a healthy global economy. All of this discourages war since it would be tantamount to the death of the economy. These days, leaders prefer to fight their battles with money, rather than might. And despite some recent trends, there is still less nationalism worldwide than there once was. What’s more, with increased access to information from around the world, it’s more difficult for governments to monopolize information and control a narrative through propaganda. In the Fourth Age, poverty and hunger could also be things of the past. While today too many people still suffer from poverty, that number has greatly decreased in recent years. In 1980, half of the people in the world lived on less than $2 a day. By 1990, that number had fallen to 35 percent, and over the next five years it dropped by half, so that by 1995 it stood at 17.5 percent. Today, 12 percent of the world lives in poverty, and there’s little reason to think that the number won’t continue falling. Even though the average per capita income globally is around $30 a day, there are a billion people who get by on just $2 a day. However, as history has shown, technology multiplies human labor and can bring about a continual increase in productivity and prosperity. While there is still plenty of wealth disparity, as innovation continues apace, the billion who reside at the bottom income level could very well gain the tools they need to rise out of poverty and tap into the wealth of the modern world. AI could make automated doctors, teachers and technicians accessible to anyone with a smartphone. So there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the new world that lies ahead. The key message in these blinks: We stand at the brink of a new era, one that will be determined by the development of technologies such as robots and artificial intelligence. As we consider what lies ahead, it’s important to be aware of the different beliefs and biases that shape the conversations and predictions about the kind of impact this technology will have. The bottom line is, no one knows for certain what the future holds, but there are reasons to be optimistic about it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Today this is truer than ever, as this increasingly complex and interconnected world is changing at an unprecedented pace. But out of this blizzard of moving pieces it is possible to identify six larger themes that will no doubt play a big part in shaping the future of humanity. If you want to prepare for the future, you need some kind of road map, and in these blinks you’ll find the makings of one. In the following blinks, you’ll discover: why, whoever you are, you may soon find yourself out of a job, why the internet can spur revolutions as well as quell them, and  why the rising global population may mean we’ll soon run out of everything.\n The first major theme to be examined is the new global economy. Thanks to increasing free trade and advancements in communication and transportation technology, the simple truth is that the world as a whole is rapidly becoming a single integrated economy: Earth Inc. This development has two major impacts for workers. First, jobs are being increasingly outsourced to developing countries, where labor costs are cheaper. While this has improved the economic health of those developing countries and grown their middle class, it is also increasing unemployment in the developed world. Second, jobs are also being lost to robosourcing, when machines and computers take over jobs formerly performed by people. And these machines are increasingly autonomous, so there are no new jobs to be had in supervising them either. In fact, even service jobs – where one might have considered human employees essential – are being robosourced. For example, bank tellers and travel agents are already being replaced, and soon professional drivers may also face the same fate, given that self-driving cars are being developed. It is true that outsourcing and robosourcing have created some new jobs as well – for example, in the financial industry, and in fact these new jobs pay very well. But as there’s not enough of them to go around, the high pay merely contributes to the growing gap between the rich and the poor. As the middle class disappears, there will be fewer affluent customers to buy goods, and this in turn will be bad for the economy as a whole. There are indications of this trend in developed countries already, and eventually the now soaring middle class in developing countries will face the same fate. The only solution is to redistribute the wealth of the richest few to compensate for the lost income of the people who become unemployed. Unfortunately, so far the rich have been resistant to the idea, and have used their political sway to prevent any government action. As you might have guessed, the rise of Earth Inc. has not been bad for everyone: in this new dynamic, private corporations are becoming increasingly powerful economic entities. In fact, more than half of the world’s largest 100 economies are now corporations. With this economic power corporations have gained political power too. Why? In many Western democracies, especially the United States, politicians depend on corporations to fund their campaigns. Elections can be won or lost based on who invests the most into expensive television advertising. This means corporate backers become essential, and politicians then feel indebted to those backers and will feel pressure to push their political agendas. What’s more, corporations also invest in advertising campaigns that can sway public opinion on their side too. The result is of course that the interests of private citizens are constantly being trampled in favor of those of corporations. For example, consider that 90 percent of Americans would like to see genetically modified food products clearly labeled, but the agribusiness lobby has still managed to prevent this from actually happening. The fact that the United States is pandering to corporate interests in this way is the likely cause of another major global shift in power occurring at the moment: one that takes influence away from the United States. For a long time, America played an important role in maintaining peace and stability throughout the world. But now, its reputation as a corporate lackey is undermining the United States’ moral standing and credibility. Sadly, this is depriving the world of an important and responsible leader at a time when it sorely needs one. At the same time, China is emerging as a new superpower to rival the United States. Indeed, China is expected to become the biggest economy on the planet within the next decade. In this arena too the solution is clear: the democratic governments of the world need to limit the ability of private corporations to affect policy, and this can only realistically happen if citizens actively call for it. Of course, one of the biggest global shifts that has occurred and is occurring is the rise of the internet. People today are connected to huge global network. In 2012, internet users numbered 2.4 billion, and as connectivity spreads to every corner of the world, we can expect virtually everyone to be online soon. As the internet expands, it is also being connected to many new devices and systems, ranging from refrigerators in your home to packages sent in the mail. The sheer size of this network is producing vast amounts of data – so called Big Data – and it presents a fantastic opportunity to improve many facets of our lives. For example, the pace at which people top up their mobile phone accounts can be used to predict unemployment – the more worried they are about job insecurity, the less money they put on their phones. Also, spikes in online searches for terms like “flu” can be used to predict the spread of diseases, as sufferers head online to find relief for their symptoms. But perhaps the greatest benefit of the internet lies in the way it can allow citizens to influence governments. Just as the Print Revolution that occurred in fifteenth century Europe allowed new ideas and knowledge to be spread, thus spurring people to challenge feudalism, so can the internet help spur democratic debate in today’s dictatorial regimes. Just by looking at recent revolutionary political movements like the Tahrir Square protesters in Egypt or the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States, it is clear how powerful a tool the internet can be for citizens to organize themselves and give resonance to their collective voice. In the United States, the internet can also help curb the rising political power of corporations, by providing political candidates with a cheaper platform to present themselves than television, thus decreasing their need for corporate funding. At the same time, journalism is also migrating online, away from the influence of corporations, to better reach people and spur healthy democratic debate. The previous blink outlined the benefits of the internet, but clearly there are also drawbacks. First of all, as anyone with an internet connection can attest, it is easy to focus on the entertainment value of online content, remaining blissfully oblivious to serious political issues. But more importantly, there is an inherent danger in the fact that everything we do online, be it browsing websites, sending emails, uploading photos or making purchases, is recorded. Companies can use all this data to create very precise profiles of individuals and then target advertisements at them. What’s more, though the internet can spark political reform, it can also be used to stifle it. As an example, consider that during Iran’s Green Revolution in 2009, the government was able to track digital communications to identify and hunt down dissenters. Though this may seem like an extreme case, one must remember that Western democracies too have claimed that in order to better protect their citizens, they need a greater mandate to conduct surveillance of them online. It is easy to see that this is a slippery slope that could endanger liberty itself if governments gain the ability to monitor the very thoughts and ideas of their citizens. Of course, there’s also the danger of cybercrime. After all, anything that is connected to the internet can also be hacked into for criminal purposes like identity theft. This includes your personal accounts, the systems of businesses, as well as those of government agencies. Consider that the internet security company Norton estimated the annual global cost of cybercrime to be a staggering $388 billion. In the case of government agencies, hacking could even be used as a way of waging war, with catastrophic results. All these threats make it clear that while we take advantage of the many benefits of the internet, we must also pass new laws to ensure the protection of online information, while simultaneously guarding our privacy. Another theme that is likely to have an impact on every area of our lives is biotechnology. In agriculture, for example, food products made from genetically modified organisms or GMOs have spread far and wide. These are crops like corn or tomatoes that have had new DNA spliced into them in order to give them desirable traits like resistance to pests. GMOs have in fact become very widespread: for example, in 2011 eleven percent of the world’s farmland was planted with genetically modified crops. Clearly there are dangers and issues related to this practice. Perhaps the most obvious of which is that it is hard to predict the long-term ecological impact of manipulating the genes of organisms and then releasing them into the wild. This risk is further emphasized by the fact that genetically modified animals are just around the corner: in 2012 US scientists applied for approval to introduce genetically modified salmon for human consumption. Another risk arises from the fact that GM crops are genetically uniform by design, so if a suitable pest or disease were to arise, it could wipe out huge swathes of crops at once, endangering the world’s food supply. Even more worrisome, the GM industry is dominated by a few large players like the massive Monsanto. The political sway these behemoths hold makes one wonder whether GMOs are being regulated as closely as they should be. Medicine is another prominent domain of biotechnology. Advances in genetics can, for example, help doctors diagnose patients more precisely and craft more effective personalized treatments to match genetic backgrounds. What’s more, many devastating diseases like cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s may soon be eradicated as new medical methods like gene-based therapies are developed. But if genes can cure diseases, could they also “cure” undesirable behavioral patterns, such as propensity for violence? Or can they make people more intelligent or attractive? Questions like these highlight the serious ethical issues medical biotechnology brings to light. Clearly the only way to resolve them is through healthy, open democratic debate. As citizens of Planet Earth today, one issue we simply must confront is the rapid population growth that’s underway. Consider that the current global population stands at ca. seven billion people, and is expected increase by two billion in the next quarter century. The total population is expected to stabilize at just above ten billion near the end of the century. The bad news is that even at current population size we’re beginning to see serious negative effects. For example, since most of the population growth is happening in developing countries, people are increasingly migrating to developed ones, and this is spurring a resurgence of racist and xenophobic attitudes. At the same time, people all over the world are flocking from the countryside to cities, and this hyperurbanization is putting tremendous pressure on municipal governments to provide adequate housing, sanitation, etc., to these incomers. If development continues along these lines, the number of people living in slums in projected to double over the next few decades. But even these concerns are far overshadowed by the environmental impact of the rising global population. After all, there is a limit to the amount of natural resources we have at our disposal, and as global consumption skyrockets, we are likely to hit those limits. These key resources include things like topsoil and freshwater, on which our very survival depends, but it seems we are also bound to hit the limits of many other commodities too, like iron, coal, corn, soybeans and palm oil. In fact, over the past decade, their market prices have soared due to increased demand. As one observer noted soberingly, “we may soon reach ‘peak everything.’” As discussed in the previous blink, population growth is placing a tremendous strain on our natural resources. But not everyone is worried about this. Some techno-optimists point to the fact that the depletion of natural resources has been a worry countless times before, but new technologies have always come to the rescue and allowed us to do more with less, thus stopping us from hitting the limit. For example, advancements in material sciences and 3D printing could help us produce and distribute goods far more efficiently than before, thus reducing demand for commodities. Techno-pessimists, on the other hand, believe that even new technologies won’t be enough to make up for the current unsustainable rate of consumption, especially when it comes to the most indispensable ones: topsoil for farming and freshwater for drinking. For example, while there are advances in technologies for turning seawater into freshwater, they are still not cost-effective on a large scale, and should not be relied upon. Thus it seems that despite technological advances, we simply cannot keep mindlessly consuming as much as we are now, and the long-term solution must come from elsewhere. But where? At the moment, a big part of the problem is that when countries make political decisions, they’re not even taking into account the depletion of natural resources. This is because their sights are set solely on maximizing their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as this is considered to be a good measure of economic success. But in fact this is absurd, since it completely ignores the future cost of recklessly depleted resources and an utterly polluted planet. It encourages short-sightedness and recklessness, and also ignores social ills like increasing inequality. Clearly a good way to move forward is to redefine GDP so it includes environmental goods as well as economic ones. Of all the issues the world will face in the future, perhaps the most all-encompassing is the climate crisis. The climate crisis is caused by CO2 and other greenhouse gases accumulating in the earth’s atmosphere and thereby raising planetary temperatures at an alarming rate: nine of the ten hottest ever recorded years since 1880 have occurred in the past decade. If this development continues, we can expect severe negative effects on our food and freshwater sources: The amount of arable land will decrease as water evaporates from soil more quickly and dust storms become more commonplace. What’s more, the increased temperature will melt polar ice caps and raise sea levels, thereby flooding coastal farmlands with salt water. At the same time, pests and diseases will proliferate in the hot climate, further endangering the crops on the little arable land that remains. Simultaneously, freshwater supplies will be depleted by the uneven rain patterns caused by global warming, and many aquifers will be contaminated by rising seawaters, thus leaving us not only hungry, but thirsty too. Happily, it is still possible to reverse this development, but only if drastic measures are taken: this late in the game, the only solution is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 90 percent. Because the main emission culprit is the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, energy production that depends on them must be eliminated in favor of renewable sources. This must be done through government policy. For example, CO2 emissions should be taxed and cap-and-trade schemes enacted to encourage polluters to cut back on their emissions. What’s more, subsidies to fossil fuel companies should be eliminated and instead directed at renewable energy companies. The biggest obstacle in this, as you might have guessed, is the massive political influence of the world’s fossil fuel corporations, who are actively misinforming governments and the public about the severity of the situation. The only solution is to put these corporations in their place. The key message in this book: The six major forces that will shape the future hold both threats and opportunities. The key to mitigating the threats and leveraging the opportunities lies in curbing the increasing political power that corporations are wielding in the Western world, particularly in the United States.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

West","summary":"Drones dropping off Amazon packages at your front door. Digital menus at restaurants. Algorithms buying and selling stocks and approving loans. Driverless cars and trucks taking you and your goods to their destinations. These are no longer ideas for the future, they’re just some of the ways automation is impacting the workforce today, and more developments are expected tomorrow. In many ways, technological advances like these are inevitable and make perfect business sense. You can’t expect a company to decide not to save millions of dollars by carrying on employing people to do something that a robot can do four times as fast, non-stop with fewer mistakes. When McDonald’s announced their plan to replace cashiers with automated menus, their stock went up immediately. It’s good business. So what does all this change add up to? It’s what people are calling the new digital economy, and while it may be inevitable, there are many things that need to happen if we hope to prevent chaos and disarray. As author Darrell M. West explains, we need to rethink our approach to work, job training and how we receive benefits like health insurance and pensions. If we act now, we may be able to make the transition smooth; if not, there may be trouble. In these blinks, you’ll learn which 1888 book was quite prescient in its depiction of a future workforce; which CEO considers artificial intelligence one of the greatest threats facing civilization; and how something called a citizen account may be key to the future workforce. Back at the turn of the twentieth century, the United States underwent what the author refers to as a “megachange” as a result of the nation’s shift from an agrarian economy to an industrial one. It took decades for the government to deal with the effects of this change and for things to settle down. Now, we are at the brink of another megachange, and this time, the nation will be shifting from an industrial economy to a digital one. At the heart of this change is a new business model built around automated robots and artificial intelligence (AI). And we’re already starting to see it emerge, especially around blue-collar jobs. Some of the most reliable jobs for people who didn’t or weren’t able to go to college have been in restaurants, retail or in transportation – and these are now being affected by automation. Restaurants across the United States are replacing waitstaff with tablets that make recommendations and explain the menu. An increasing number of retail stores are replacing cashiers with self-checkout options that are getting more advanced. Amazon has a chain of retail stores where customers will soon be able to use an app to have purchases charged to their Amazon account. Meanwhile, at an average income of $43,590 a year, driving a truck has long been one of the more lucrative jobs for someone with a high school education. But now, automated vehicles are expected to become an industry standard. In all of these cases, automated services offer a way for businesses to save money. Not long ago, robots and automated services cost more than it would cost to pay an employee for the same job. But this is no longer the case. At Dynamic, a manufacturer of metal parts, a robot can perform the same job of four people for the one-time cost of $35,000. Plus, it doesn’t catch colds, need breaks or health insurance. Another noteworthy factor is the reduction in human error. At the cell phone manufacturing company, Precision Tech, 60 robots now do what 650 employees used to, and mistakes have dropped from 25 to 5 percent, while production has more than doubled. As for automated vehicles, experts expect fewer accidents and better fuel efficiency due to smoother acceleration and braking than with human drivers. Steven Mnuchin, the Trump administration’s treasury secretary, told the press that he isn’t concerned about AI as he believes it won’t be a factor until 50 or 100 years from now. Others aren’t so quick to brush off the immediate concerns surrounding AI. According to Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, AI poses one of the greatest risks to civilization and can certainly be a cause of great disruption to the job market. What really makes AI competitive is machine learning. This is the ability to make a decision based on a certain set of factors, and then use the results of that decision to inform future choices. This process results in continuous improvement, and it’s what allows AI to now be a viable replacement for all sorts of jobs that were once strictly human occupations, like driving vehicles or making financial investments. Indeed, while AI is likely found on your mobile device or at home, whether it’s Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa or Microsoft’s Tay, it’s also currently making decisions about a lot of important everyday things, including finances, defense systems and public safety. Already, AI is replacing many jobs in the financial sector because it can spot tiny fluctuations in the stock market that could signal a good time to buy or sell stocks. It can also quickly make thorough background checks to determine if someone qualifies for a bank loan. As a result, experts predict that bank branches could soon let go of as many as half their staff. The US military is using AI as part of Project Maven, a national defense scheme. The military uses AI to scan through massive amounts of surveillance footage and flag anything that looks suspicious or unusual. Some hospitals are using AI in a similar way by having it scan medical images to detect things like potentially cancerous lymph nodes. Again, this automated service saves money, since radiologists can charge upward of $700 to look at four images in one hour, while AI is seen as more efficient and also more accurate. But some ethical issues have already arisen. In Chicago, AI is being used by law enforcement to determine which areas are most likely to have criminal activity. Already, there are complaints that this has led to innocent people in those areas being harassed by the police. This highlights another important aspect of AI: its predictions can never be totally objective, as they are heavily influenced by the amount and quality of the data used, as well as the value judgements of the designers when they define “fair criteria” for the system. A major component in the digital economy will be the Internet of Things (IoT). Made possible by the high connection speeds of the fifth generation (5G) internet network, the IoT is when entire systems of physical goods and household objects become connected and can be monitored and adjusted in real time. For example, your smartwatch could be used to track vital health statistics that are monitored by a physician who could periodically advise you to cut down on your sugar intake or drink more water. Indeed, healthcare is an industry that is expected to be hugely impacted by the IoT and its use of sensors and monitors. Your health data is expected to be available soon to any medical professional through cloud storage, and with an increasing number of portable monitoring devices, patients in rural or hard-to-access areas will benefit greatly from these services. Already, in Taipei, Taiwan, the Citizen Telecare Service System monitors the elderly in their homes using the city’s free wi-fi. The program has already shown great results in quickly recognizing the warning signs of cardiovascular disease by monitoring heart rates for arrhythmia. Infrastructure has also seen improvements from the IoT. In some US towns, as much as 30 percent of water usage is wasted through leaky pipes, and 5G sensors allow these leaks to be spotted immediately. Water usage sensors are particularly valuable in dry areas like California, which is already putting them to use in homes, leading to a reduction in water usage of 15 to 20 percent. Some areas have taken up “smart city” initiatives where real-time monitoring of everything from garbage collection, transportation, traffic lights, energy management and public safety is underway. And some 75 towns in the United States are using a sensor called Shot Spotter, which recognizes the sound of a gun being fired and immediately sends the coordinates to the police for a speedy response. And who wouldn’t want to sit in less traffic? With smart traffic lights, cities and towns will no longer have to deal with inefficient lights that only operate on one pattern, regardless of how many cars are on the road. And the benefits go beyond reducing traffic. By adjusting traffic lights in real time, there will be less pollution from fewer cars idling, and people will get to their destinations faster. According to MIT economist, Andrew McAfee, we should expect most of the jobs currently available to be replaced by automated services at some point in the future. The jobs that are more likely to continue existing are interpersonal ones like mental health therapy and social work. This brings us to one of the primary changes we need to make in order to prepare for the new economy, which is to rethink and broaden our definition of which jobs are worthy of receiving a wage and benefits like insurance and a pension. Currently, people perform many jobs that benefit society yet aren’t paid, including various volunteer posts, mentoring, parenting and other community activities. But it’s time we started considering the monetary value of such jobs. In Edward Bellamy’s novel Looking Backward (1888), the protagonist falls asleep in 1887 and awakens in the year 2000 to find that people are no longer defined by their jobs. With technology keeping the world running, people spend their days learning new skills, teaching others and following their own personal interests. What once was science fiction is looking very much like the near future. The United Kingdom has already taken a step in this direction, as the government considers volunteer work to at least qualify as “looking for work,” so it therefore helps a person qualify for social insurance if they are unemployed. To take it a step further, why not make the activities we now consider volunteer work worthy of a salary? Art is also something that benefits society and could therefore be considered a worthwhile pursuit. Harvard economist Lawrence Katz believes that the new economy could very well have a category for those who find meaning in life through self-expression. This meaning is at the heart of many concerns about unemployment. For so long, many of us have centered our purpose, identity and meaning in life around our nine-to-five job, and therefore unemployment can come with great existential worry. However, it wasn’t always like this. In fact, throughout much of human history, our identity was based on family, community, religion and tribal matters – and it may very well be that this is what we’ll return to in the new economy. Back in 1954, union boss Walter Reuther was visiting a Ford Motors plant that had recently installed new robotic machines on the factory line. A Ford employee asked Reuther how he planned on getting union dues from the robots, to which Reuther replied, “How are you going to get them to buy Fords?” This anecdote cuts right to the problem of a changing workforce: When workers are displaced by companies eager to cut costs and raise productivity, it doesn’t just mean there are fewer people working, it also means they’re making less money and are therefore less likely to buy the products sold by the company. The effect of displaced workers is far reaching and extends beyond a drop in consumer spending. One of the big concerns is health insurance. Currently, most Americans, over 155 million of them, get their insurance through their job. But already there is a growing tally of people who earn their income through freelance or contract work that comes with no benefits. In fact, many new businesses cut costs this way, by hiring a small number of full-time employees and contracting out the rest of the work. So, to avoid a bigger healthcare crisis than already exists in the United States, some economists are suggesting portable or flexible citizen accounts. These would be accounts with a number of safety net items to which all workers would be entitled, regardless of whether they were unemployed or working full- or part-time. These items would include health and life insurance, retirement funds and unemployment compensation, as well as credit that could be put toward continued education and learning new skills. This brings us to another step we need to take in preparing for the new economy: job training. The idea that a person’s education stops at around 25 is no longer relevant. Technology and jobs are quickly and constantly changing, and society needs to recognize education as a lifelong endeavor. Fortunately, there have already been impressive strides in remote learning, which uses online courses that allow people to learn on their own schedule, which could be a great asset for job training. These are just some of the considerations that need to be made now, before the next economic crisis hits. We should also be talking about the possible benefits of providing people with a basic minimum income, more flexible requirements around professional licensing and new ways to tax the wealthiest citizens in order to fund the programs we’ll need to transition into the new economy. As we can see, society needs to prepare for the job displacement many economists anticipate. Yet there is very little discussion happening on Capitol Hill. A big reason why few politicians are paying attention to the growing threat of automation is the extremely polarized nature of today’s politics. Getting a fiercely partisan Congress to agree on anything, never mind broad changes to fundamental programs like unemployment insurance or creating new employment options, is virtually impossible. It’s worth noting that Barack Obama did address these very concerns before leaving office. He made a speech telling Americans how changes in the workforce were making it necessary to rethink traditional ideas about a 40-hour workweek and minimum wage. In his view, the United States needed to act immediately to give itself a “runway” that would hopefully “make the transition less abrupt.” This is precisely what the author is stressing, but he sees little movement from the Trump administration or the House and Senate to suggest that this runway is being worked on. Trump’s actions suggest that he blames any unrest in the workforce on bad trade agreements and lost manufacturing jobs, but the threat of displaced workers goes far beyond these factors. He should recognize that technological advancements are changing business models and threatening jobs in nearly every sector. If Trump’s current attitudes go unchanged, the populist, anti-Wall Street, anti-globalization sentiment he has stirred up will likely worsen, and this does not bode well for easing the transition into a new economy. Inaction will only increase the tensions and insecurity being felt by the US workforce. In the past, Trump has recognized that workers feel like their jobs and even their identities are at risk, but unless he does something meaningful about it and seeks to address the new digital economy, the plight of American workers will only get worse. Researchers already see a direct correlation between unemployment and the number of suicides, drug overdoses and alcohol-related deaths in the country. A study by Princeton University concluded that these issues are especially prevalent among people with only a high school education or less – which is a group that is particularly vulnerable to job losses caused by automation. The societal impact of automation is already being felt. As it currently stands, many new businesses are worsening the wealth inequality in the United States. Thanks to automation, they have relatively few full-time employees, meaning that only a small group is reaping the earnings. To prevent an unemployment crisis and dangerous levels of social unrest, the United States needs to enact social and political reforms. Regarding social reform, citizen accounts could separate health insurance and retirement pensions from being tied to one job, and social programs like permanent job training need to be put in place. One problem with getting such them enacted is that while Democrats tend to support government spending on social programs that benefit low-income families and the unemployed, Republicans tend to advocate for a smaller government and less spending on such programs. But the real problem here likely stems from a disproportionate influence of the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent. Data from the 2016 election shows that just 100 people account for $1 billion of the $1.8 billion that went to super PACs (political action committees), which are used to fund candidates’ campaigns. That’s a lot of political influence from a small number of people. And what kind of values do the wealthiest 1 percent have? In surveys, only 35 percent believe the government should work to provide jobs if none are available in the private sector. They are also more likely to believe the government shouldn’t care for the unemployed or the quality of public schools. While the wealthiest in the United States have a disproportionate influence on politics now, it doesn’t have to stay that way. Political reforms could reduce inequality and bolster democracy, starting with campaign finance reform and putting an end to the electoral college. Political donations need to be more transparent so that voters have faith in the electoral process. This faith in democracy also extends to the voting process. Currently, the electoral college gives sparsely populated states a disproportionate amount of power. For example, the densely populated state of California gets one elector for every 713,637 people while Wyoming gets one for every 195,167. In the recent past, two presidents have already been elected despite not having won the popular vote. Each time that happens, more people lose faith in democracy and start believing that the system is rigged. If the United States hopes to ease tensions, democracy needs to be strengthened. This is necessary for preparing the nation for what lies ahead. The key message in these blinks: There’s a new economy on the horizon: a digital economy, which is based on automated robots and artificial intelligence performing most of the tasks most day jobs comprise today. To prepare for this inevitability, we need to rethink how we define the jobs we deem worthy of wages and benefits. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

No doubt, one of the most tantalizing is the vast universe around us: countless galaxies, stars and black holes hurtling through space light years away. Happily, some four hundred years ago the telescope was invented, and this allowed humanity to begin charting and understanding the vast reaches of space. But when it comes to an equally fascinating and complex mystery – the mind – it took much longer for even rudimentary tools of enquiry to emerge. In fact, the brain imaging technologies that one might say constitute the first, crude telescopes for the mind were only invented a few decades ago. This means that we’re still only taking our very first strides in understanding the functioning of our brain. Yet even after these brief glimpses, it’s clear that new neurological research and technological applications offer great promise in curing ailments as well as enhancing our already formidable brains. In these blinks, you’ll find out why one half of your brain might be religious while the other is atheist; how you may soon be able to upload and share your memories online; and how genetic modifications have made some mice into veritable geniuses. Scientists have long been fascinated by the human brain and the precise function of each part. Before the advent of modern methods, they used fairly crude approaches to gain knowledge about the brain. For instance, they would dissect the brains of deceased people with brain damage and, based on the symptoms the patients had exhibited while alive, guess what the damaged part of the brain was responsible for. Despite these primitive methods, scientists were eventually able to understand how the brain had evolved into its current state. Basically, they found out that, because species on earth evolved from reptiles into mammals and then into humans, new brain structures were added on top of the old ones. This means that our brain was built on the following three clear stages of evolution visible even today: First, there is the reptilian brain, located at the back and center of the brain, and so named because it is almost identical to the brain of reptiles. This 500 million-year-old structure controls the most elementary mental functions necessary for survival, like breathing and the heartbeat, as well as basic behaviors like fighting and mating. Second, on top of this ancient part is the mammalian brain consisting of the limbic system and the cerebral cortex, i.e., the outer layer of the brain. All mammals have developed these systems, which allow for higher-order thinking skills and more complex social interactions. Third, our human brain is most clearly separated from other mammals due to the fact that our prefrontal cortex, the outer layer of the brain located directly behind our foreheads, is so big and complex. This is where rational thought is processed and grandiose human plans for the future are made. It is like the CEO of the brain. As you can see, the human brain is, in fact, a bit like a museum of evolution, comprising remnants from the species that came before us. It’s fairly common knowledge that the brain is split into a left and right hemisphere, and that each hemisphere has specific functions: in muscle control, for example, the left side of the brain controls the muscles on the right side of the body, and vice versa. Another difference is that the left hemisphere houses the brain’s language capabilities, whereas the right side contains areas responsible for spatial awareness. What’s more, the left side is better at analytically examining the details of a given situation, whereas the right side is better at intuitively and imaginatively integrating many pieces of information into a bigger picture. This is where the common idea that more rational people are “left-brained” and more artistic are “right-brained” comes from. Though this is something of a simplification, research indicates that the two hemispheres may indeed have different personalities. This is best seen in experiments with people whose two hemispheres have been severed – a procedure often performed on people with epilepsy. By selectively presenting information to only the left or right side of a subject’s field of vision, scientists could actually communicate with only one half of the brain, asking each hemisphere questions. For example, one neuroscientist asked a split-brain patient’s left hemisphere what he would do after graduation, and the patient said he wanted to become a draftsman. However, when the right hemisphere was asked, it gave a markedly different response: “automobile racer.” Then there was a study where a split-brain patient was asked whether he was religious or not. The left hemisphere said that he was an atheist; the right side, however, claimed to be a believer! In the previous blink, we learned that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and vice versa. This is hardly a new discovery: one German doctor already figured that out in 1864 while treating soldiers with wounds to the brain; whenever he touched one side of the brain, the opposite side of the body would move. What’s more, since the 1930s, scientists have also had a fairly accurate idea of which part of the human cortex controls which part of the body. In fact, Dr Wilder Penfield, a brain surgeon, produced a remarkably accurate “brain-to-body” map by stimulating his patients’ brains with an electrode and observing which muscles twitched. Penfield’s diagrams also show that more brain area is allocated to more important body parts: for example our mouths and hands are crucial for survival, so larger swathes of the cortex are devoted to controlling them than, for example, the skin on our back. Other specific functions that have been pinpointed in the brain are the two language areas in the left hemisphere responsible for producing and understanding speech. These areas are called Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area after their discoverers, who found that damage to these areas produced certain language disabilities. For example, damage to Broca’s area tends to stop the patient from articulating words, whereas damage to Wernicke’s area results in the patient not being able to understand language. By the 1990s, scientists had begun to glean an even better view of the brain, including its basic building blocks: neurons which are connected in an immensely complex network. Estimates state that there are as many neurons in the average human brain as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy – roughly 100 billion. Since the 1990s, the technologies scientists use to explore and understand the brain have taken great leaps forward. One major area of technological development is brain imaging, which has allowed researchers to actually look inside the brain. Perhaps the most influential of these advancements is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where powerful magnetic fields are used to measure the flow of blood to various parts of the brain. Because neurons require more blood when they’re active, increased blood flow indicates which neurons are active when. Many other brain imaging technologies have also been discovered and are being developed, but a common trait to all of them is that there is a trade-off between spatial and temporal accuracy: they are either good at measuring where something happens or when something happens, but not both. Thus, none of the other technologies really represent a substantial improvement over fMRI. Besides advances in brain imaging, there is also development in brain probing, where parts of the brain are stimulated or disturbed to study the effects. One technique for this is transcranial electromagnetic scanning (TES) where a magnetic pulse is directed through the skull at a particular spot on the surface of the brain, thus dampening its activity and demonstrating its role. For example, using TES on the left hemisphere of the brain can inhibit a person’s ability to talk. Another promising advance in brain probing comes from optogenetics. Here a light-sensitive gene is inserted directly into a neuron, resulting in that neuron firing whenever a light is shone on it. Effectively, this allows individual neurons, as well as the behaviors they result in, to be flicked on and off like a light switch. Finally, there have also been advances in brain therapy technologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS). In DBS, hair-thin electrodes are inserted deep into the brain so that they can stimulate the desired area. This technique has already proved valuable in treating ailments, such as depression and Parkinson’s disease, and holds promise for other brain-related problems as well. In the previous blink, we looked at some of the technological advances in studying and manipulating the brain. These advances have opened the door to possible applications that may sound like science fiction. First of all: telepathy. Scientists have found that individual words produce distinguishable neuronal activation patterns in the brain. This means that by monitoring a person’s brain as words are read aloud to them, scientists can compile a “dictionary” that shows which neuronal patterns are related to which words. At the moment, this application is still rather crude, but as the dictionary becomes more precise, this could, for example, allow people who are unable to speak to merely think words and have a voice synthesizer say them out loud. What’s more, a similar “dictionary” has been created for images, and even dreams: subjects are first shown hours of images to understand which images light up which parts of the brain and later, by monitoring the brain, scientists can guess what kind of images the subject sees or dreams. Another futuristic-sounding development is telekinesis, or using thoughts to control objects such as computers. The process is similar to the development of telepathy as described above. A patient’s brain is observed as they perform various tasks on the computer, like moving the cursor left and right; the computer then compiles a dictionary capable of translating brain activity patterns into actions. This technology was already tested in 2004, when it enabled paralyzed patients to communicate via laptop. But, in the future, this same technology may be used to allow humans to remotely operate robots to perform tasks too arduous or dangerous for people. It’s even conceivable that, one day, a single individual could orchestrate an entire construction yard full of cranes and bulldozers and other equipment to construct a building using only the power of his or her mind. Another area of the brain’s functioning that has been illuminated by advances in brain imaging technology is memory. In this area, too, recent progress has been very promising. First of all, neuroscientists have found a way to erase specific memories in mice using chemicals. When this method is perfected for humans, it could well be used in therapy to erase painful memories. Second, scientists have also made their first strides in “uploading” memories onto a computer. This has been achieved by inserting electrodes into the brain of a mouse and recording the neuronal activation pattern when it learned to perform a simple task, effectively storing the memory on a computer. Hold on though, it gets even more impressive: next, the scientists deleted the memory in the mouse’s brain using chemicals, so it was no longer capable of performing the task. Then, using electrodes inserted into the mouse’s brain again, the scientists stimulated the same neurons as they did before to artificially download the memory back into the mouse’s brain. And, lo and behold, it worked – the mouse could once again recall the task! The next step will be to upload a memory onto a computer from one creature and download it onto another. If this happens, it may soon be possible for people to record their memories and share them online like we do with photos today. Third, we may soon all have super-memories: scientists working with fruit flies have found that they can give certain flies photographic memory through very simple genetic manipulation. Though much research still needs to be done, similar methods could theoretically boost human memory as well. And it may not only be our memory that can be boosted, but also our general intelligence. Scientists have gotten promising results in creating “genius-mice” through genetic modifications. Clearly, with many fascinating avenues of research being pursued, there is still much potential to be unlocked in the human brain. Though advances in brain-imaging technology have opened the door to many applications, there is still a lot of fine-tuning to be done. As this happens, there’s no doubt that our understanding of the brain will greatly increase. One such ambitious project on this front is the BRAIN initiative, intended to map all the neurons and their connections in the human brain. Having and deciphering such a map would be of great help in many of the applications already discussed, but also the one we have yet to touch on: artificial intelligence (AI). Of course, some degree of AI already exists: in 1997, for instance, IBM’s computer Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in chess. However, in many ways, today’s AI is still far from being human: for example, whereas a human will easily recognize a chair even if seeing that particular chair for the first time, a computer will probably not decipher its “chairness,” seeing instead a jumble of angles and lines. Part of the problem is that usually AI has been designed around rigid rules, like a programmable digital computer. But sophisticated brains like the human one do not function in this way: they’re a network of neurons that are constantly rewiring themselves as they learn new things. Today, many AI researchers are looking into such a neural network approach to AI. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, for instance, one researcher has created tiny, insect-like robots that learn only through trial and error, i.e., by scurrying around and bumping into things. Though this approach is still fairly new, it shows great promise as a future avenue toward more sophisticated AI, especially as our understanding of the human brain is also increasing and thus providing a better “role model” for AI. In the previous blink, it was mentioned that current AI technology falls short of human intelligence in certain ways. Indeed, in order for AI to truly be human-like, it will need to emulate many fundamentally human traits. For one, it would need to be able to properly behave in the extremely wide range of situations we encounter in everyday life. This requires a value system: robots with AI would need to be told how everything in life is ranked in importance, like an ethical guideline. This is, in effect, what we humans do, too. But while it may take us a lifetime to refine our ethical system, the poor robot would probably need to have its own system completely figured out before leaving the factory due to safety concerns. What’s more, to truly react appropriately to humans, robots with AI would also need to have some capacity for emotions, as they are a fundamental part of the human experience. In fact, scientists from the University of Hertfordshire have already made some headway here by building the robot Nao, which is capable of interpreting and displaying a wide range of human emotions from fear and sadness to pride and happiness. Finally, robots with AI must also be capable of self-awareness, for they need to make decisions about future courses of action, and this demands considering their own role in those scenarios as an independent actor. Happily, scientists have already made progress here, too. One team at Yale University created the robot Nico, capable of recognizing itself in a mirror – the first sign of basic self-awareness. With so many promising strides being taken toward genuine artificial intelligence, it looks like we can one day expect the world to be full of robots who will act as our helpers, and possibly even our friends and companions. The key message in this book: Advances in brain imaging technology are opening or have opened the door to many futuristic-sounding technologies, like controlling computers with thoughts, artificial memory boosts and downloading memories. Thought experiment: What kind of technologies and advancements would you feel comfortable with when it comes to your brain? Many of the possibilities mentioned in these blinks are tantalizing but might also arouse some apprehension. After all, most people feel that the brain is pretty much the epitome of who we are. As a thought experiment, think about what kind of technologies you would happily adopt. For instance, would you happily accept intelligence-boosting gene therapy or would you worry about it changing “who you are”? Or would you accept electrodes to be surgically inserted into your brain if it meant you could directly experience the memories and emotions of your friends and loved ones?","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Perhaps you rely on a tax advisor, as you couldn’t imagine filing your taxes on your own. Or perhaps you’re the type who instead, with a few Google searches, is changing the oil on your car, diagnosing a friend’s persistent cough and managing the books of your own personal business. These scenarios give rise to a debate that is relevant in today’s internet-based society. Where exactly is the line between what we need experts to do and what we can do ourselves? Perhaps more importantly, where should that line be – or should it exist at all? Drawing on years of research, these blinks introduce you to the changes currently taking place in the professional world. You’ll see why these changes are necessary, and what it means for our future.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how a data-crunching computer handily beat two Jeopardy super-contestants;  why if technology threatens a professional, he’s doing “professional” wrong; and why tomorrow’s automated world will have more jobs, not less. How skilled are you at doing your own taxes, diagnosing your own illnesses or educating your children?  These kinds of skills are certainly complicated; no person can manage all of life’s challenges completely independently. People need guidance on topics that they may not know much or even anything about.  This is why we turn to others who are more knowledgeable and skilled than we are in particular fields of expertise: professionals.  Professionals educate our children, help run our businesses, fight for our legal rights and care for us when we’re sick or injured. We trust professionals because of their knowledge, expertise, experience and character.  Professionals don’t simply memorize knowledge from textbooks and journals; they also know how to tailor that knowledge to each person with whom they work. They stay current with developments in their field, and aim to maintain a high standard of quality in their practice.  Importantly, we trust professionals, expecting them to be honest and selfless, keeping our best interests at heart. In turn, society in general grants professionals the autonomy to manage their fields of expertise. We can think of professions like clubs. Members decide who gets in, and set the standards for training, examinations and required credentials. Professionals often also manage their own schools, universities and institutes. For example, if you want to be a credentialed teacher, you’ll have to attend either a certified school or special classes, and eventually pass a state examination. Some professions also often maintain full legal authority over certain fields, such as health. This is why only a licensed doctor can prescribe certain medicines, those that could be dangerous if not administered correctly. In short, we need professionals to keep us safe. If you need to seek the advice of a lawyer, do you worry first about the cost? It’s not an unreasonable concern. Many people simply can’t afford the services of a professional.  Many countries as a result find it difficult to maintain a high level of quality in professional services, as funds are often lacking to support schools and hospitals, for example.  The financial crisis and resulting public funding cuts have further exacerbated this situation. Today few people can truly afford access to professional expertise – whether tax advisors, bookkeepers or consultants.  Yet the internet has created new ways for the average person to access and share knowledge and information. Previously, only a professional was privy to high-level information relating to a specific field. For example detailed medical information was accessible only to students or doctors in academic libraries or professional facilities. Now nearly anyone can diagnose a cough or learn how to file taxes online. Online communities, video tutorials and even the rise of online universities have opened the floodgates of knowledge for countless people around the globe.  Professionals, however, tend to resist changes that dilute the exclusive power of their chosen professional fields.  By definition, a professional knows more about her field than the person to whom she’s offering services. Often, an expert might unconsciously (or even consciously!) try to keep an intellectual distance from a client to maintain her profession’s exclusivity, discouraging self-help or self-discovery. She may even use complicated jargon in an attempt to justify high fees.  When professionals are disingenuous, however, they fail to hold up their end of the professional bargain. So here’s the question: should the public trust professionals to reform themselves? The last time you felt ill, how long did you wait before you saw a doctor? Plenty of people put off seeking the help of a professional. Yet soon, such concerns might not be a problem anymore.  Thanks to technology, we’re entering into an age of easier access to professional services.  Technology makes professional work more efficient by automating routine tasks. Automatization can take care of manual or administrative work, allowing a professional to focus on more complex or rewarding tasks.  Teleprofessionalism allows a patient to have a video consultation with a doctor, for example, to offer medical advice when the doctor or patient can’t be there in person. An instance of telesurgery enabled a team of surgeons in the United States to “remove” the gallbladder of a patient some 4,700 miles away in France! Advanced technology can assume other aspects of professional work, through the creation of protocols, standardized documents or online services. This should result in enhanced productivity and faster turnaround and delivery for services.  Automation will also become more important as certain tasks become too complex to be carried out by professionals alone. There are now over 13,000 known diseases, 6,000 drugs and 4,000 medical procedures – far too much information for one professional to know and master. Technology also makes professional expertise more readily available to the layman, threatening certain professional positions. In 2014, for example, 48 million US citizens prepared their taxes with online software instead of with the help of a tax professional.  Increased internet access now allows expert knowledge to reach people no matter where they are. The Khan Academy, for example, offers educational videos online for free. In 2014, it registered 10 million visitors per month! Few people enjoy the process of filing taxes. Each year, laws change and it becomes harder and harder for the average citizen to keep up with new, ever more complicated regulations.  In the United States alone, tax regulations are updated an average of once per day. Each year, it’s estimated that some 6.1 billion hours are spent filing taxes. That’s equivalent to three million people working full time.  Individuals, as well as small and big companies, already have technological solutions for filing taxes. In the United Kingdom, for example, small businesses that previously depended on accountants for monitoring their cash flow now use online software. The software keeps track of a company’s finances and updates tax documents as the year progresses, so that the return is set to go once the fiscal year has ended.  Tax advisor Deloitte, for example, distilled the knowledge of some 250 tax specialists into one digitized system. This system is now used by companies all over the world.  Tax specialists also use technology to organize accounting work, predicting tax that is due and making changes to accounts to minimize the tax that needs to be paid. Technology too can use its data-crunching power to offer advice on managing cash flow, determining the pros and cons of mergers and acquisitions and even helping to figure out the best location for corporate headquarters.  Deloitte has even created a mobile app geared for expat professionals to offer advice on where to travel with the goal of minimizing the professional’s tax burden.  The same set of laws and regulations that defines tax accounting is also applicable to general business accounting, so in the near future, we’ll see specialized systems assuming more accounting work as well.  Modern technological systems are powerful, thanks the growth in computational power over the years. This has led to groundbreaking advances in the crunching of enormous data sets, a process known as big data.  Big data techniques can identify and predict patterns in very large data sets. This sort of processing power is highly valuable in today’s data-rich world.  With the growth of video and digital images, society now generates as much data every two days as was generated from the beginning of time up until 2003. And from these gigantic data sets, we can extrapolate interesting, useful things about society and the world.  Google Flu Trends, for instance, was a project that analyzed Google searches to help track and potentially predict the spread of the flu on a global level. By comparing current search terms to search data from past flu outbreaks, the project sought to predict which areas of the world might be likely to experience a flu outbreak at a particular time.  Through harnessing the power of big data, this type of digital research could potentially be more efficient in predicting disease outbreaks than simply counting people with flu symptoms once they visit a doctor.  Supercomputers with extraordinary computing power can even perform increasingly human-like tasks. IBM built a computer, called Watson that can play the television trivia game Jeopardy. To play Jeopardy requires a wide range of general knowledge, as well as an understanding of human speech. In a live TV game against the two best candidates in Jeopardy’s history, Watson won by a landslide! Now Watson helps diagnose cancer and develops treatment plans, partly by comparing a patient’s symptoms to a database of over 10 million patient health records. Watson also helps conduct research, as it can read and process information much faster than can any human. Considering that the medical field publishes a new professional paper every 41 seconds, no doctor can possibly keep up with such a mass of information – but Watson can. You don’t lose what you know when you share your knowledge with someone else. Unlike physical goods, knowledge is nonrival, meaning its value doesn’t decrease when it's shared.  In fact, the opposite occurs. Knowledge actually grows when it’s shared.  A teacher, for instance, improves with each school year. The more a teacher practices sharing her knowledge and engaging her students, the better she gets at conveying information and making it stick.  After teaching for several years, a teacher might even distill the insight she’s gained into a book about pedagogy and the psychology of learning, passing her knowledge along even further.  Knowledge is also non-excludable, meaning it’s not possible to prevent someone from using it. When a doctor advises a patient on how to deal with an illness, the patient can then pass that knowledge on to whomever they choose.  The shift from a print-based to internet-based information society has also further facilitated the creation, access and spread of knowledge.  Information from any field of expertise can now be digitized and stored on a computer. In 2000, only 20 percent of the world’s information was stored digitally. Today, that figure is around 98 percent.  Technology also shapes the way we create and share knowledge. With the internet and using social media platforms, a single person can send a message to thousands of people with just a few clicks. Thus professionals in turn can get their work into the world much more easily, if they choose to do so.  As technology progresses, more and more tasks will be performed by non-specialists with the assistance of digitized processes and systems.  Computer-aided design (CAD) software, for instance, enables hobby architects to design more detailed, complex projects. Resulting designs can be more easily shared and reused than can traditional hand-drawn plans. Digitization also helps to cut costs. Standardization helps to prevent errors and encourages the reuse of templates and information, by establishing and utilizing norms and protocols, thus making the process more efficient each time.  Standardization is also important because the more information we accumulate, the more challenging it becomes for a professional to stay on top of it all. It’s here where standardized routines come into play, as they ensure certain processes are carried out correctly, allowing a professional to focus on more intellectually straining or unique tasks. Such tools will become more versatile as they’re shared more frequently online. New users can and will improve on them, making tools more valuable and widely applicable.  Yet the advent of expert knowledge becoming a common online good raises questions about the kind of society we are building and want to be part of.  If we distill the knowledge of hundreds of specialists into a single system and make that system readily available to anyone, who is liable if the system fails? Who is responsible for maintaining it and building new software? Who owns the intellectual property rights to it? Making more expertise available online could potentially solve a lot of problems. Our decisions on how accessible that information should be will shape our future society.  The traditional role of a professional as gatekeeper to exclusive information in a certain field is long over. So what does the future hold? We should first remember that as a society, we shouldn’t be afraid of new technology. Instead focusing on the potential of technology should be our common goal. Many people are afraid that technology will “dehumanize” society, damaging personal interactions. While this is theoretically possible, the opposite is equally possible. The social media platform Twitter, for instance, actually brought journalists and their readers closer together.   When professionals feel threatened by technology, they are in essence misunderstanding their role. Their reason for being shouldn’t be to maintain their privileged status, but to help solve society’s problems by providing even more access to their expert knowledge.  Contrary to the fears of many professionals, technology won’t lead to a decrease in the number of professional jobs.  Economists once falsely thought that a society offers a fixed quantity of reasonably paid work. If that were the case, machines would be harmful to our jobs and well-being. The opposite is true, however.  While technology has partly automated traditional ways of working, it has also given rise to completely new forms of employment. Process analysts, for instance, are important in allocating tasks between humans and machines.  Professionals need to be flexible, adapting to new technology as it becomes available. Technology can dissolve the boundaries between professions, bringing people together. Thus professionals need to be prepared to go with the flow to ensure they stay relevant in our modern world. Technology is a tool to make knowledge more accessible; it helps us all.  The key message in this book: Society is on the brink of a major change when it comes to the concept of professionalism. Thanks to technology, expert knowledge, now digitized and disseminated online, is far more readily available to the layperson. That doesn’t render professionals obsolete, it just means their roles are changing. Professional expertise will always be important, as today’s mass of knowledge cannot be mastered by a single individual alone; technology is the tool that will help us all get ahead.   Got feedback?

A few decades later, during the 1930s in the United States, the visionary Henry Ford revolutionized the car again, making it affordable for all sectors of society. Today, we are on the cusp of yet another automobile revolution. Ever since the 1960s and 1970s, when major cities around the world began to suffocate in smog, calls for everyday transportation with less polluting engines have become progressively louder. Now, with electric vehicles on the rise, we are witnessing a pivotal moment in the history of automobiles. In these blinks, you’ll delve into the history of the electric car, take a detailed look at its pioneers and visionaries, the competition to develop an electric vehicle, and the winners and losers in the race to an electric future. You’ll also learn what the term “Fordism” means; why you shouldn’t promote nuclear energy in Japan; and why Chinese people don’t need a Tesla. Cars have changed the world like no other technological advancement, and that’s largely due to one of the automobile’s early innovators: Henry Ford of the Ford Motor Company. While Ford didn’t invent the car, he did transform the way it was built. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company, which began producing its first car – the Model T – shortly after. By 1910, the company was building 20,000 Model Ts every year. From then on, production continued to skyrocket, and by 1927, Ford was building one car for every five Americans. But such incredible productivity was no coincidence – it was a result of Ford’s groundbreaking production philosophy, which we now know as Fordism. The idea was simple: Ford only built one model of car, in one color. His goal was for the finished product to be durable and to have mass appeal. By sticking to one model, Ford was able to utilize an assembly line system, wherein a car moved along a row of workers, each of them responsible for just one step, until it was completed. This ingenious system allowed Ford to keep his prices so low that even poor Americans could afford his company’s cars. It allowed him to export them to Tokyo, Shanghai and other cities around the world. So, by the time the 1930s rolled around, the three US car companies, Ford, General Motors (or GM) and Chrysler, were dominating the international auto market. For instance, in 1938, while Germany, Italy and Japan were producing a combined total of 437,000 vehicles per year, the United States was producing about 3.5 million! And while Ford was focused on a single model, GM – a collection of many small manufacturers – was diversifying its mass production. Similar to GM, Chrysler combined several marques such as Plymouth or Dodge. However, while the auto market was dominated by US companies early on, you’ll soon see how Japanese car companies quickly took the lead as people started to become increasingly concerned about emissions. It’s no secret that the Japanese car manufacturers of today outcompete their American counterparts. But do you ever wonder why? It’s primarily due to the close attention they paid to the problem of car emissions. In the second half of the twentieth century, smog became an increasingly serious issue and the auto industry found itself slapped with more stringent environmental regulations. It was simple math, really: since cars emit pollution that causes smog, the more cars on the roads, the more smog in the air. So, it was just a matter of time before environmental regulations were introduced to slow down the booming auto industry. When the first states introduced them in the 1970s, automakers in America claimed the regulations were so strict as to be “impossible” to follow. At the same time, their competitors across the Pacific Ocean were also experiencing an auto boom, and smog was similarly becoming a major issue in big Japanese cities like Tokyo. As a result, environmental regulations in Japan forced companies to strive for lower emissions. Although Toyota and Nissan dominated the Japanese auto industry at the time, it was the then-underdog company Honda which was the quickest to seek out innovative solutions to the emission rules. At first, the Honda team, under the guidance of founder Soichiro Honda, experimented with alternative fuel sources like hydrogen. But they quickly found that such new technology was hard to implement, and instead changed their focus to redesigning the combustion engine. Their work resulted in a redesigned cylinder that was much more fuel-efficient and, therefore, less polluting. In fact, the design was so effective that, in 1971, Mr. Honda announced that his cars would meet the 1975 Japanese environmental standards by 1973. It was at this point that Japanese automakers really seized control of the global market. To meet the new, strict environmental standards at home, US companies had to license this technology from Honda. But the United States wasn't the only country paying attention to Japan’s rise in the auto industry. Their success also caught the attention of China, and one Chinese engineer in particular jumped at the chance to get his country started on its way to becoming an automotive superpower. Once the auto industry had reduced its emissions, the next frontier was electric vehicles, also known as EV. Such cars would produce no emissions at all and China was the first country to really attempt to make them a success. How did China find itself leading the way? In the 1990s, when California was again poised to tighten environmental regulations, automakers rallied against any new laws. It was then that Chinese engineer Wan Gang, of the German automaker Audi, took notice. He had studied in Germany and had been working for Audi for a few years – but his dream was to transform the Chinese auto industry. To do so, instead of borrowing, buying or stealing technology from established auto manufacturers, he wanted to breathe new life into China’s car companies. However, China’s huge population and corresponding demand for cars made the pollution from auto exhaust a huge risk. As a result, Wan’s vision was to make the Chinese auto industry the most environmentally friendly in the world. He began by presenting this vision for a new Chinese car industry and a technologically advanced, clean car to a Chinese delegation of high-ranking government officials, who quickly brought him back into the country. He was appointed professor at Tongji University and was put in charge of a secret government project to develop electric vehicles. The project was extremely well funded since the government was keen to beat Western carmakers to the punch. And because of China’s growing position in the world economy, nothing seemed out of reach; the project raced out of the gates. But, as you’ll see, it, unfortunately, didn’t come to fruition. At the same time, however, a nuclear engineer in Japan was teaming up with Mitsubishi to build an electric vehicle of their own. At the turn of the twenty-first century, with Honda having the best Japanese combustion engine on the market and Toyota content working on hybrids, there were still no truly electric vehicles on the Japanese market. But that all changed thanks to Takafumi Anegawa, a Japanese nuclear engineer. While everyone in the Japanese auto industry was rushing to catch up with Toyota’s hybrid technology, Anegawa was setting out to build a real electric car. After all, hybrids – the best the industry had to offer at the time – used both combustion and electrical power, so they still burned fuel. So, Anegawa saw the need for a truly electric vehicle, and his vision was to build one that ran on nuclear generated electrical power, thus allowing Japan to break free from foreign oil. However, the Japanese government wasn’t especially keen to promote nuclear energy: the island is regularly struck by earthquakes and typhoons, both of which pose a catastrophic threat to nuclear power plants. As a result, the Japanese public is largely skeptical of nuclear power. People soon started referring to Anegawa as “crazy Anegawa.” Undeterred, Anegawa still took his idea to Toyota and Honda, but the auto giants declined as they were so focused on their respective work with hybrids and combustion engines. Luckily, there were plenty of other eager auto manufacturers out there, and Anegawa launched his electric vehicle program in partnership with Mitsubishi, Subaru and his own employer, the Tokyo Electric Power Company or TEPCO. This collaboration was of particular interest to Mitsubishi, since the company had been struggling for several years. The project received government funding, primarily from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, to develop an electric car that was affordable for the general public, which meant lowering the target price from $48,000 to $35,000. They had soon produced their first electric vehicle, the Mitsubishi iMiev, one of the first Japanese electric cars intended for mass production. But while Anegawa was hard at work in Japan, Elon Musk was transforming the US auto industry. Let’s look at his story next. Have you seen the movie Iron Man, with the main character Tony Stark? Well, did you know that Stark’s character is based on Elon Musk? It’s true. The film follows the billionaire engineer Stark as he transforms into the action hero Iron Man, and Musk, a real-life billionaire, engineer and visionary, was the perfect template. So what was Musk’s claim to fame? He founded the electric car company Tesla, and in the process transformed the American auto industry. Musk began with an expensive sports car, aimed at wealthy customers and powered by 6,831 lithium-ion batteries. He then released the Model S, a luxury sedan built to outperform any fossil fuel-powered competitor. After that, he turned his attention to building a smaller electric car that would be accessible to the general public. So how did he do? Well, despite some initial technical hang-ups and lack of confidence from financial markets, Tesla cars are now on the road and the company has a growing fan base, largely propelled by the launch of the Model S. This should come as no surprise because the sedan is a magnificent car and was in fact developed with the help of the US government. Here’s what happened: When the 2008 financial crisis struck, two of the three major US car manufacturers were bailed out by the federal government. At the same time, Tesla was in trouble and needed a $465 million loan from Washington. Getting this money let the company realize its vision and launch the Model S. This was significant because the car is nothing short of remarkable. It can go 300 miles on a single charge, can accelerate in an instant and has the best crash test ratings ever. In fact, Consumer Reports has even said that the Model S is the best car they’ve ever driven. Soon after Tesla revolutionized the electric vehicle industry, and in the process joined the race with Japan, a catastrophic natural disaster would threaten Japan’s electric vehicle projects. Japan is no stranger to natural disasters and, in March of 2011, a massive tsunami once again threw the country into turmoil. The colossal wave struck off the Japanese coast and nearly caused a nuclear catastrophe. The 2011 tsunami was the biggest ever to reach Japanese shores, causing waves of over 100 feet. The results were devastating, with many cities destroyed and thousands of lives lost – but another major issue was that Japanese nuclear plants tend to cluster along the country’s coastline. So, while some of them are built at high elevations and are protected by huge walls, the plant at Fukushima wasn’t so fortunate. While a major explosion at the plant was averted, the reactor leaked huge quantities of toxic water and, due to safety issues, every one of Japan’s nuclear reactors was shut down. This fact drove TEPCO, the operator of the Fukushima reactor, to bankruptcy. If that name sounds familiar it’s because TEPCO was also the sponsor of Japanese engineer Takafumi Anegawa’s electric vehicle project, which now found itself on thin ice. Soon, the project was faced with yet another threat, because diplomatic tensions with China were endangering all Japanese electric vehicle projects. So-called rare earths, a type of chemical element found in the Earth’s crust, are an essential component for electric vehicle batteries. China essentially had a monopoly on these substances, producing about 97 percent of the world’s supply in 2010. This had made Japan particularly dependent on China, and China suddenly halted deliveries to Japan when, in 2010, the Japanese coast guard imprisoned a Chinese captain due to a conflict over territorial rights in the Pinnacle Islands off the East China Sea. The Japanese electric vehicle industry was only saved in 2013, when Japan discovered a great source of rare earths at home. But did the Chinese really withhold their supply of rare earths over a single sea captain? The truth is, what they really wanted was to take control of the global electric vehicle industry. China has the largest population of any country in the world and one would assume that they have a market for everything. Well, as it turns out, they don’t have one for electric vehicles. But to learn why, we’ve got to go back to Wan Gang, the Chinese engineer who wanted to get his country started on the road to an electric vehicle. In 2013, he still held this aspiration; but while the Chinese auto market is the largest in the world, people there weren’t showing much interest in electric cars. So, Wan secured subsidies for research and development, and even ones for customers – but his vision failed nonetheless. Besides the relatively poor quality of his product and a lack of electrical infrastructure, the main reason for the failure was simply low demand. Lots of Chinese people don’t need a car at all, much less a high-performance one like a Tesla. After all, the majority of them live in urban apartment buildings that don’t even have parking spaces. What they really need is an electrically powered public transportation system that can accommodate a billion people. But another issue was that Chinese companies simply didn’t have the technology to compete in the electric car industry. A great example is the battery manufacturer BYD, in which even Warren Buffett bought a 10 percent share. The company got their start making batteries that were not exactly up to environmental standards before going on to produce lithium-ion batteries in partnership with Motorola. Later on, they would switch their focus to sustainability, producing things like solar panels, electric bikes and power storage devices. However, their shot at an electric vehicle failed miserably, because their technology was poor and was priced far too high. And this wasn't an isolated incident; the company was representative of the situation across the board in China, which just didn’t have the technology to develop its own electric car. So, China couldn’t cut it – but, as we’ll see, California and Japan continue to soar ahead. From the passage of the first environmental law in California to the launch of the Tesla Roadster, it’s been a wild ride. But in the end, California’s concerted efforts have paid off and the state is now the world leader in the electric vehicle industry. So, while the race for the best electric vehicle is still in full swing, California has a substantial lead. While the US auto industry is under the control of Washington and most cars are still produced in Detroit, California is picking up momentum. And it wasn’t just federal dollars that got them there. After all, China invested the most money of anyone into its national electric car projects, while California barely invested any. Instead, it was the fact that California saw electric vehicles as a long-term investment in air quality, reduced dependence on foreign oil and better environmental health in general. But it’s also important to say that without Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, California would never be where it is today. After the successful launch of the Model S, Musk announced the creation of a gigafactory that will produce batteries on a huge scale, thereby reducing the cost of the third model by about 30 percent. However, Japan has become the clear leader in terms of electric cars in general. By 2011, the majority of the world’s electric vehicles were produced in Japan, and the country was also making motors, batteries and other technological features for most electric vehicles around the world. So, despite frequent natural disasters, the country is still managing to hold onto its position at the top of the industry. Not only that, but Takafumi Anegawa, the Japanese visionary, managed to convince his country that electric vehicles are their ride to the future. And this isn’t just the case for Japan, it’s true the world over. Thanks to Japan and the state of California, we’ve gotten a good start at integrating this technology into our lives – for a cleaner environment and a safe planet. The key message in this book: Electric vehicles are our ride to a cleaner future, but the road to that future has been riddled with obstacles. While many companies and countries have taken a shot at overcoming these hurdles, California and Japan are currently leading the pack with innovative ideas and high-quality products. Got feedback?

We have impressive access to so many life-changing devices: the personal computer, the smartphone and the internet.  When asked which person or company is responsible for coming up with these innovations, one would be forgiven for giving credit to modern-day giants like Google or Amazon.  Yet these companies are really late to the scene. They’ve reaped the benefits of technological innovation, rather than helped create it. The true birthplace of the tech revolution was Bell Labs, a research arm of telephony monopoly AT&T.  These blinks will show you just how talented and creative the teams at Bell Labs were, and why we all share a great debt to their thirst for scientific knowledge and discovery. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Bell Labs created the perfect environment for innovation; what the connection is between satellites and solar panels; and why scientists work best when deadlines aren’t a stress. Alexander Graham Bell patented the first working telephone in 1876. Looking to capitalize on his groundbreaking invention, Bell founded the Bell Telephone Company, which later evolved into the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, or AT&T.  In the 1890s, however, Bell’s telephone patent expired, opening the door for other companies to take advantage of the technology. To remain competitive, AT&T resolved to use the power of science and research to provide better service to its customers. This is how, in 1925, AT&T founded Bell Telephone Laboratories. One of the goals of the labs was to make phone service more reliable, and cheaper. At the time, the telephone was still a rudimentary technology. Phones did not ring; dial tones and busy signals had yet to be invented. A caller would shout into a receiver until someone on the other end noticed! Yet Bell Labs’s overarching focus was to investigate communication in its many forms, whether through a cable or over a radio wave, with recorded sound or using visual images. AT&T president Theodore Vail was the driving force behind this vision, encouraging teams to explore advances in physics and chemistry that might transform the way people communicate. Bell Labs hired top scientists, and a majority of its employees were graduates of the leading universities in the United States, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago and the California Institute of Technology.  Mervin Kelly, for example, was one of the most gifted physics students at the University of Chicago before coming to Bell Labs. In 1951 he was named director of the labs, and his work was pivotal in changing the communications industry.   Bell Labs became an intellectual hub for many eminent scientists, some of whom even went on to win the Nobel Prize.  The struggles and catastrophes of the first half of the twentieth century left a mark on Bell Labs.  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, for example, Bell Labs management needed to reduce employee working hours. Nevertheless, the young scientists made the best of the situation and used non-working hours to participate in study groups and pore over scientific textbooks.    With the outbreak of war in the 1930s, Bell Labs shifted its focus to developing military equipment. In 1940, when US politicians demanded that the nation’s scientists contribute to the war effort in Europe, Bell Labs almost completely abandoned its regular work. As a result, some 75 percent of Bell Labs’s work was focused on immediate military use.  Bell Labs’s research department was also tasked with exploring the possibility of building a weapon out of uranium – that is, to create a nuclear bomb. Consequently, the physicists at Bell Labs discovered how to create a nuclear reactor. But Bell Labs’s most significant contribution to the war effort was the radar.  Even as an early, simplistic technology, radar was a crucial part of military strategy, as it could be used both offensively and defensively. Radar could detect incoming enemy aircraft and submarines, guide gunfire and bombs, and help land a plane at night or in dense fog. Bell Labs scientists were given the task of further developing and improving radar technology, which they did with impressive results. Scientists created workable designs for new radar instruments that could detect objects from distant locations. Bell Labs early on realized that good employee communication leads to innovation. Employee offices and the labs were located in different areas, so that scientists had to walk between the two. The idea was that when scientists crossed paths, they could chat and exchange ideas.  This strategy worked, as the Labs were a hotbed of groundbreaking innovation in the post-war decades. One major achievement came in the form of the transistor, invented by Labs scientists in the 1940s. Bell Labs physicists Walter Brattain and John Bardeen developed a method of amplifying – or switching on and off – an electrical signal by sending it through a slice of silicon. This was the world’s first transistor.  Yet it was almost useless as a practical device, as even a simple hand motion could make the transistor behave unpredictably. Fellow Labs scientist William Shockley, however, found a way to improve the transistor’s design to fix this issue. Even though the transistor came to be seen as one of the most significant technologies of the twentieth century, at first the public just didn’t get it. The New York Times reported a four-paragraph story on its invention – on page 46 of the daily paper. The computer industry, however, was intrigued. It was quickly realized that the transistor was a critical digital tool, as it could be turned on or off with a small burst of electricity – which essentially could be translated into a “yes” or “no,” or a one or a zero. Furthermore, once encoded in ones and zeroes, transistors could be connected to process batches of information. This early transistor went on to become the building block for all electronic devices, and led to the development of the modern computer industry. When the transistor was unveiled publicly in 1948, its importance and potential wasn’t immediately grasped on a grand scale. Yet there was one person who got it: Bell Labs mathematician Claude Shannon. In the mid-1940s, Bell Labs technicians began experimenting with more efficient methods for transmitting telephone calls. One idea that seemed promising was a method known as pulse code modulation, or PCM. At the time, phone signals were generally transmitted by electrical waves. PCM translated these waves into “on” and “off” pulses. This meant that, with PCM, rather than sending waves through a telephone cable, a series of electric pulses could be sent instead. Building on the concept of PCM, Shannon was the first to realize that all communication could be thought of in terms of information encoded as binary digits – or “bits.”  Each bit would correspond to a piece of information, each piece essentially representing a choice between two things. So one bit could be defined as a choice between a one and a zero. What Shannon had conceived would become the basis of what we now know as information theory – one of the most significant intellectual achievements of the twentieth century.  In effect, Shannon’s ideas, combined with the invention of the transistor, became the foundation of all modern digital communication, from cell phone transmissions to compact discs to even deep space communication. Had mathematicians been eligible for the Nobel Prize, Shannon would certainly have been in the running. Instead, in 1985, Shannon was awarded the Kyoto Prize for outstanding contributions in the field of mathematics.  Since the invention of the telephone, engineers dreamed of the next big communications step, allowing a person in North America to call family in Europe. Yet this seemed a Herculean task, considering the thousands of miles of cable required to cross the Atlantic – and even then, it just wasn’t possible to transmit signals over such a distance of cable.  It wasn’t until the 1950s when overseas telephony became possible – and with it a new invention called satellite technology. Of course it was Bell Labs scientists who developed one of the first communications satellites. In the 1950s, engineer John Pierce proposed an idea for satellite communications. Pierce had envisioned an orbiting, uninhabited spaceship – or satellite – that could relay radio, telephone or television signals over great distances.  He thought that a signal from one part of the world could be directed toward a satellite orbiting in space. The satellite would receive the signal, then direct it to another part of the world. The very first satellite was ready to launch on August 12, 1960. Bell Labs scientists, with the help of the newly established US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), unveiled Echo 1, the first communications satellite. Bell Labs scientists were pivotal in building Echo 1, yet the process posed many difficulties early on. For instance, the satellite required a reliable, inexhaustible power source.  While studying the properties of silicon, Bell Labs scientists Cal Fuller and Gerald Pearson discovered a way to build a silicon solar battery, which became the first functional solar power device. A satellite was the ideal recipient of this new solar technology.  Bell Labs technicians were also responsible for inventing and developing a type of horn-shaped antenna, which allowed for the more focused reception of signals and reduced interference. The transistor and the radio. Solar cells and communication satellites. All of these technologies originated at Bell Labs, and each have completely revolutionized the modern world. Yet there was still more to come.  In the 1960s, Bell Labs scientists began research on mobile telephony – the working or use of mobile telephones. There were two problems they had to solve: First, there were few available wireless frequencies, meaning only a few calls could be placed simultaneously. Second, it wasn’t clear how a caller could move around without a call disconnecting. By 1970, though, engineer Amos Joel managed to solve both these issues, and Bell Labs had invented the basis for the reliable mobile technology we depend on today. Another visionary invention occurred in 1969, when a group of computer scientists wrote a revolutionary computer operating system. This evolved into Unix, the system which would become the foundation for many subsequent computer languages. Despite all this success, Bell Labs saw its fair share of failures. One huge flop was the Picturephone. The Picturephone was a device that allowed audio-visual communication, not unlike what we can now do with Skype and Facetime.  But this was 1970. Although AT&T was right to believe the technology had huge potential, its public release was a complete failure. As it turned out, customers preferred the more impersonal method of a regular phone call! Just the same, among so many innovative inventions, failures like the Picturephone were accepted as inevitable by-products of the broader vision. What exactly is innovation? An idea that strikes a lone inventor in a moment of inspiration?  Actually, innovation tends to be more of a convergence of ideas over the course of time, whether months or even decades, as groups of people carefully consider various questions. It was Bell Labs’s Mervin Kelly who created a more strategic approach to the process of innovation. Kelly was a physicist and researcher, and was also the Labs’s company director from 1951 to 1959. He is credited with establishing a structure to foster innovation at Bell Labs. Kelly encouraged interdisciplinary groups, combining physicists, chemists,  metallurgists and engineers to tackle problems together. He brought together theoreticians and experimentalists to ponder questions of new technology and truly think “outside the box.” He also instigated a policy whereby junior scientists were encouraged to approach more distinguished minds with questions. Importantly, when they did so, senior scientists were not allowed to turn junior scientists away – thus encouraging a free flow of ideas. Many researchers also enjoyed full autonomy, as Kelly allowed them to explore and ponder new ideas without having hard and fast deadlines or even concrete objectives. However, such an approach relied heavily on AT&T’s monopoly status. Kelly knew that to innovate and bring great ideas to the world, the company needed not only excellent minds but also a reliable stream of funds. Bell Labs was indeed well-funded, backed by AT&T’s de facto telecommunications monopoly, reestablished in the 1920s when the company scooped up independent, local telephone companies. This monopoly was also supported by the government, as politicians viewed telephone competition as an “endless annoyance” and preferred to deal with just one corporate representative in the telephone industry. The government thus permitted AT&T’s monopoly with the understanding that its scientific research worked in the interest of the public. By the 1970s, the political and social acceptance of AT&T’s telecommunication monopoly began to wane.  The US Justice Department headed up a lawsuit that demanded AT&T be divided into smaller, competitive companies. In 1984, AT&T was finally forced to let go of its local phone company holdings, which then became independent corporations. With the dissolution of AT&T, it was clear that Bell Labs would soon follow. Yet the management of AT&T stuck to their original commitment to continue to fund basic research and throughout the 1980s, Bell Labs scientists continued to wow the world with significant discoveries. One team, for example, discovered a phenomenon known as the fractional quantum Hall effect, and subsequently won the Nobel Prize. Yet cut-throat competition in the telephony market hit AT&T hard. It needed to reduce spending and was forced to cut staff at Bell Labs, too. In 2006, the main campus was shuttered for good. So how do the research efforts of today’s technology leaders compare to the legacy of Bell Labs? While leading companies such as Google, Apple and Microsoft do maintain research departments and have a steady cash flow to support such efforts, basic research isn’t their top priority. Breakthroughs in scientific knowledge are clearly far less important to these companies than market expansion and profit maximization. The key message in this book: Bell Labs was the birthplace of groundbreaking innovations like the transistor, radar, satellite communications and mobile telephony. Innovation at Bell Labs was cultivated by an egalitarian philosophy and mutual idea exchange, the results of which few tech giants today can measure up to. Got feedback?

And what makes this time so interesting? The prevalence of data. Today, data is the raw material, and it can be processed and used to create new industries or revolutionize old ones. The industries that thrive – the industries of the future – will create opportunities for new jobs and businesses, and make it possible for developing nations to transition smoothly into the new information age. But with these developments come new challenges. For instance, how to use big data and create jobs for people displaced by technology? Let’s dive right in. In these blinks, you’ll discover why people in Kenya prefer to transfer money by text message; how cloud computing will make robots the preferred type of labor; and why Estonia is called e-Estonia. Can you remember your first job? For lots of people, their entry into the job market was at a cafe or a restaurant, waiting tables or serving coffee. But in the future, such jobs might not even be available. That’s because the introduction of cloud computing has enabled robots to do the work of humans. For instance, advances in cloud robotics – robots’ ability to upload experiences to the cloud and learn from the experiences of all other robots – mean that robots can now learn and grow faster than ever before. As a result, robots are going to be capable of completing new tasks. In fact, an Oxford University study found that 47 percent of all US jobs are at great risk of being done by robots in the next two decades. For instance, the car service Uber runs a research lab that is building an automated taxi-fleet and Google’s research lab, Google X has been working on a driverless car project for six years! But why would we want to replace human workers with robots? Well, robots can service more people at lower prices. That’s because, unlike humans, who are cheap to hire but costly to keep on staff, robots don’t get paid a salary or take vacations. In fact, they can work all the time. Just consider SEDASYS, a robotics system that oversees the sedation of surgery patients. Without SEDASYS, an anesthesiologist can only monitor one operation at a time, and his presence adds $2,000 to the cost of the operation. With SEDASYS, however, a single anesthesiologist can simultaneously oversee ten operations, and his efforts only add $150 per operation. However, the value produced by robots isn’t going to be equally distributed. Therefore, governments need to do something about the income people will lose. In fact, most of the savings made possible by robots will go straight to the big corporations that produce them. That means it’s up to governments to redistribute part of those savings into things like social-safety nets, education and skills training for the labor force displaced by robots. In the early 2000s, the human genome – that is, all of the information encoded within human DNA – was sequenced for the first time. The project cost $2.7 billion, but, since then, technological advances in genomics, the field of genome sequencing, have cut the cost of sequencing to around $1,000. But why is genomics important? Well, a better understanding of the human genome will mean better prevention and treatment of disease in general and cancer in particular. Cancer is the result of mutated DNA, which malfunctions, failing to stop the growth of unhealthy cells. With advances in technology, doctors will be able to find, and hopefully prevent, this growth earlier. For instance, a new blood sample test known as a liquid biopsy lets technicians identify even the smallest pieces of cancer DNA in a blood sample. This makes it possible to discover a tumor that’s 1 percent the size of those an MRI can find. This new technology will mean that 47 percent of cancers can be detected while they are still stage 1. This is a huge advance. For instance, ovarian cancers have a 95-percent cure rate when in stage 1. But the present technology tends to detect such cancers at stage 3 or 4, when chances of curing the patient are just 5 percent. New medical technology in the developing world will mean something even more essential: connecting people to the fundamentals of health care. For instance, mobile communications are now present throughout Africa, but the number of doctors is quite low, standing at just 0.2 doctors per 1,000 people in Kenya. Seeing this discrepancy, smartphone-based programs could be developed to connect patients with doctors and other specialized health-care workers who could then respond to medical questions, deliver diagnoses and check-ups and monitor the progress of treatment. In fact, EyeNetra has produced a small plastic lens that can be attached to a smartphone and, when combined with an app, diagnose vision problems and prescribe the necessary corrective lenses. This obviates the need for a long trip to an optometrist and makes expensive machines redundant. Nearly every person has the same routine before leaving the house: cell phone, wallet, keys. But pretty soon, you’ll only need two of those essential items. That’s because current methods of payment are hurting business, a fact that’s bound to change. For instance, credit-card technology is not only complicated, but it sucks up a huge percentage of retail profits. After all, most internet companies maintain profit margins of around 5 percent and about half of that gets paid out to credit card companies or service providers. For example, companies pay monthly statement fees, monthly minimum fees, gateway fees and transaction fees of between 2 and 5 percent per transaction. Seem like a lot of information? Well, MasterCard’s policy on interchange fees is over 100 pages long! Furthermore, since most countries have low access to banking systems, people tend to rely on alternative forms of payment. In fact, in most low-income countries, simply setting up a bank account is a seriously difficult task and securing a credit card is just about impossible. That’s why Kenya developed an alternative that has since spread to 45 other countries. It’s called M-Pesa and it’s a payment system that uses mobile phones. It allows anyone with a SIM card to transfer money by sending a text. And it really caught on. In fact, about 25 percent of Kenya’s GDP moves through M-Pesa. But the best part is that it works internationally, an essential feature, since approximately $40 billion per year is sent back to Africa by workers living abroad. However, such systems are just the beginning. Technology is going to push payment to even greater heights as encrypted currencies, like Bitcoin, gain more steam. Here’s how they work: Such alternative money technologies send encrypted messages that make for easier, faster payments. That kind of access means anyone can set up shop and charge for services. For instance, Airbnb and Uber are great examples of how business is becoming more distributed and local. And encrypted digital money is so safe that it can even be used to purchase a home! It used to be that parents who wanted their kids to secure a steady career would tell them to go to medical school. Today, however, being a doctor isn’t as appealing as some other professions, such as cybersecurity. Here’s why: More and more data is collected and stored every day. In fact, as soon as a kid is handed a smartphone, they begin leaving a lifelong trail of data. Indeed, there are now private corporations that specialize in data collection and maintain around 75,000 individual data points about the average American consumer! And with the Internet of Things – that is, the online network of normal objects like toasters and fridges and cars – this number is only going to spike. The problem is that once we create data, we have no say in how or by whom it is used. Not just that, but some companies who focus on targeted marketing sell extremely sensitive data. For instance, a company from Illinois sold lists of rape and domestic violence victims, as well as HIV/AIDS patients, to pharmaceutical companies at the bargain rate of just $79 per 1,000 names. So, since it’s almost impossible to control your data, you need to be clear about what data you’re making available. And that goes for individuals, companies and governments alike, because all three are prone to cyber attacks. In fact, banks, energy companies, air traffic control systems and just about every business that exchanges information depends on data technology. This reality makes such operations prime targets for criminals and enemies. Further complicating things, the internet has no borders, which means there are no clear jurisdictions that help mediate disputes between states. Naturally, all this data, and the potential for its destructive use, produces a serious demand for experts in the field of cybersecurity. OK, so now you know the future is cybersecurity, but does that mean other careers will be irrelevant? Actually, tech workers will always need the support of other professions. Big data analysis is just one part of the equation. For instance, data analytics produces insights by analyzing huge quantities of data from both the present moment and the past. The result is the streamlining of existing processes and access to information on an unprecedented scale. Just take the combination of satellite-gathered weather information with ground-based sensors that measure water and air quality, nitrogen levels and other environmental conditions. This pairing enables one to find the exact right mixture of fertilizer, water and customized seeds to plant every square meter of soil. Such precision agriculture will help farmers grow more food while emitting less pollution, which is our best option for solving world hunger. It’s also essential, however, that big-data technology and cheaper sensors team up with expert knowledge in each field – and that’s where other professionals come in. Here’s why: To apply technology most successfully it’s essential for someone to be on the ground with the requisite expertise in the field. For instance, Pasture Meter is a technique of precision agriculture that originated in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand. It employs advanced sensor technology to take 200 measurements a second, determining how much grass exists in a given field and how the cattle can be best distributed. So, while it’s unlikely that anybody in Silicon Valley would think that watching grass grow could be a profitable business, the farmers of New Zealand, home to twice as many cattle as people, had an inside perspective. In fact, in part due to Pasture Meter, New Zealand’s beef sales to China have climbed by nearly 487 percent in just one year. They’re even outselling their much larger neighbor, Australia. So, big data could mean major improvements for the industries of tomorrow. But what can be done to ensure that these improvements are actually made? Fostering an open society. That means physical openness, like strong infrastructure, but also virtual openness, like a rapid and uncensored internet, as well as economical openness, like reduced tariffs on trade. For instance, in 2000, Estonia declared access to the internet a human right. As a result of their widespread use of the internet, strong infrastructure and limited regulations on all types of services, they’ve earned themselves the nickname e-Estonia. In fact, the country even offers e-citizenship to foreigners, providing them equal civil rights and making it easy to conduct business with the country from across the globe. An open society also means encouraging innovation by giving more authority and money to young people with big ideas. Born in the digital age, the young people of today are often more open to new ideas and take greater innovative risks. For instance, in many traditional cultures like Japan, it takes decades for young people to reach the level of authority they need to fund their ideas. This hinders innovation. After all, it’s no coincidence that Google, Facebook, Oracle, Microsoft and loads of other information-technology giants were founded by entrepreneurs in their twenties. But not only young people need to be empowered; women do, too. In fact, giving women more power is not merely a matter of ethics; it’s good economics as well. Countries that suppress women’s rights are, in essence, depriving themselves of half their workforce. For instance, during the reconstruction following Rwanda’s horrific 1994 genocide, gender equality became central. The reforms resulted in women being able to register as landowners, which increased registrations by 20 percent and decreased the number of impoverished women by 20 percent. Furthermore, between 2001 and 2013, the country’s GDP rose by eight percent per year! As a result, Rwanda is currently the only country in the world with a female majority in its parliament. The key message in this book: The importance of data has grown considerably, and the way we use it will have a major impact on the future of the economy and society. Big-data analytics spurs innovation. However, it will also significantly change the job market and the security of our everyday lives. Actionable advice: Have a “data talk” with your kids.  These days, it’s essential for children to be educated about data, privacy and online security. So, it’s important to sit down with your kids and explain how their online actions today may have affect their lives tomorrow. While it’s impossible to control everything your children do – on- or offline – you can help them learn the risks associated with putting their data out there and teach them to make wise decisions on their own.

Will we travel in flying cars? These blinks show you that the future is now. Computer technology and the internet are already fundamentally changing how we think and the ways we work, consume and relate to each other. And the forces and ideas that inspired these changes are not going to go away but only get stronger. Let’s learn about the 12 distinct trends or forces that will shape society over the next decades. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why the concept of a “supermind” is more reality than science fiction; how Uber provides faster service than regular cab companies; and why in the future, there will be no more experts but only “newbies.” How would you like to live in a utopia – a perfect world in which you never suffer yet also never change? If this prospect sounds boring, don’t worry – this isn’t what the future holds. Instead, what we’re experiencing and will continue to experience is a protopia – a world that keeps getting better, one baby step at a time. In a protopia, things are always a bit better today than yesterday. For instance, even if some inventions produce problems such as higher energy demands, the benefits always outweigh the costs. But living in a protopia also means that nothing is fixed. Technology moves forward, accelerating progress. To put it differently, everything is in a state of becoming – which means you and everyone else will always be “newbies” in this ever-evolving technological world. No invention is ever finalized or fixed if each invention is a starting point for another invention or development. Just think of how the advent of personal computers paved the way for the internet. Basically, all human technology is permanently moving forward, and this process, in which every innovation has the potential to trigger another innovation, will never be straightforward or predictable. Because of this, the best predictions we can make about future events are generalized trends. And since technology never stops improving, you’ll always feel like a newcomer no matter what you learned or experienced in the past. You’ll have to upgrade your devices to adapt to the evolving digital landscape – and we all know how long it takes to get used to new technology. Your permanent newbie status is also a result of the decreasing longevity of devices and software, which means you likely won’t get to spend enough time with any technology to truly master it. For example, the average lifespan of a smartphone app – the amount of time it takes a user to stop using the technology – is now 30 days. So we now know that technology, especially information technology, never stops moving forward. Next, we’ll explore how this fact is tied to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. Over 100 years ago, the advent of electricity transformed the tools we use every day. The next technological step is artificial intelligence. Today, AI is cognifying objects, turning them into tools that are “intelligent.” Making previously “dumb” objects “smart” is one trend that will dramatically shape the future. This process isn’t limited to physical objects, however. In fact, AI will cognify chemistry, for example, using algorithms and databases to run virtual chemistry experiments. But if this is the future, will AI replace all human intelligence? Definitely not. Yet AI will certainly redefine human intelligence and perhaps humanity as a whole. While AI can enhance certain areas of study, such as medicine, this doesn’t mean AI will replace human specialists in those fields. People and AI working together will produce the best outcomes. The most accurate health diagnoses will be made by physicians, for example, who combine intuition with state-of-the-art diagnostic software. Humans won’t become superfluous, but we will have to constantly evaluate the things we can do better than computers and delegate other tasks accordingly. This will leave us to perform tasks that are uniquely human, such as caring for others and engaging in intuitive thinking, while letting AI take over other jobs such as memorization. As a result, AI will shape what we do and, in time, who we are. But AI isn’t the only technological force guiding the world of tomorrow. Online content has been expanding at an exponential rate. To make sense of all this data, we need to be able to filter out what’s important to us. Filtering, which depends on AI, will help shape the future. In just 9,000 days, people produce over 60 trillion web pages! If you ever want to find what you’re looking for online, you’ll need to use a robust filter, such as a Google search engine. AI can ably filter through content and identify relevant pieces because it can process massive quantities of data. All the while, AI learns to personalize results to individual user preferences. Material goods used to define commerce. With the advent of the internet, however, much of what is bought and sold is intangible, streamed online or shared offline. In other words, modern goods are flowing. A flowing good is a good you can purchase as a service or real-time update. For instance, previously if you wanted an answering machine for a phone, you had to purchase and install hardware. Today, software can automatically install itself on your smartphone without you lifting a finger. Once a good is digitized, a user can transform, copy or share it. Consider music streaming service Spotify, which allows a user to build playlists to then listen to, like or share with friends. Services such as Twitter, Spotify and Netflix which offer real-time content streams are just the beginning. People who subscribe to and use these services also contribute to another force that’s shaping our technological future. When you watch a movie, listen to a great song or share an insightful tweet over a social network, you’re adding your content to the general stream of online information. Sharing, therefore, is another key force that will affect how we engage in commerce in the future. Every day, people share 1.8 billion photos on social media. We’re witnessing the evolution of a sharing economy, a market in which people form networks, exchange resources and collaborate on projects – such as the open-source, online community encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A sharing economy allows any person to become a producer, by giving that person access to equipment, such as a 3D printer, for example, without having to own it personally. So we’ve explored how AI will play a major role in the future of technology and humanity. Yet have you considered how, in just a few hundred years, machine intelligence will meld with human minds to produce a “super intelligence?” This intelligence is called the force of beginning, and it marks a new era – that starts today. Consider this: 15 billion devices are already linked through the internet, essentially forming one massive circuit. New connections are made every second. What will this mean for the future? In the not-so-distant past, possession, whether of a business or a good, was essential to engage in a commercial transaction. Today the largest provider of accommodation in the world, Airbnb, owns none of the real estate it offers as rentals. This business is part of a larger trend, in which physical possession is less important and access is more important. Businesses are seeing the benefits of providing services instead of selling physical goods. Offering car rentals instead of selling a vehicle outright means a business can accrue greater benefits from the same object. A business doesn’t even need to own the object it’s “selling,” thus requiring less capital outlay for maintenance, too. Additionally, access-based businesses are often available in real time, and therefore offer better service. Peer-to-peer taxi service Uber, for example, can offer a ride to a customer faster than can a centralized taxi service, precisely because of its decentralized workforce. Every Uber driver is self-employed and owns a car, thus allowing Uber to offer the services of multiple drivers at any time, anywhere. Accessing instead of owning is a key driver of the future. This force will enable another crucial force, remixing. More and more growth today is generated by rearranging content – even further rearranging rearranged content – instead of producing new resources. It’s not possible to talk about remixing without mentioning the transformation of people from passive consumers to active content producers. While Hollywood makes 600 feature films yearly, 100 million video clips are shared on the internet every day, and many are simply remixed snippets of preexisting movies. Now that it’s so easy to copy and remix content, the next step should be a service that offers video hyperlinks, allowing people to cite specific frames of a film or video at the click of a button. This also means that property rights will need to adapt, as most are written for a world of tangible, owned goods, not digitized snippets that are easily accessed and remixed. Virtual reality, or VR, is a form of simulation that is essentially fake but feels real, which is why it could change our lives. For instance, the possibilities offered by VR will transform human interaction while increasing the actual number of interactions people have. Interacting is another key force that will affect the future. As devices become less expensive to produce and purchase, people will be able to spend more time in virtual reality scenarios. As the technology develops to react more accurately to voice and movement, for instance through eye tracking, VR will begin to feel more “natural.” But VR will also offer people the feeling that they have “superhuman” senses, such as x-ray vision. With time, people may start to perceive such senses as synonymous with regular human senses. A person’s interaction with VR technology will undoubtedly change his self-perception; and as a result, that person will want to keep interacting with VR. Immersion in technology will become the norm, and objects that don’t offer VR capabilities, such as printed photographs, will start to appear “broken.” VR will open up space for greater interactivity between people. Within a virtual world, you can meet thousands of people from all over the world without setting foot outside your home! While virtual reality will transform the world and our relationship to it, screens as well are having a profound impact on how we absorb information. Indeed, screening is another powerful future trend. In the future, screens won’t just be fixed on subway station platforms or smartphones, but will appear everywhere. This is an important development. On screen, text and ideas aren’t fixed and authoritative as they appear in printed books but rather constantly changing and thus open to question. Compare the Encyclopedia Britannica, a series of printed tomes, to its online equivalent Wikipedia, where users can discuss and edit entries. Screens encourage us to interact, pushing us to research and discuss the ideas on display. Do you value your privacy? If you do, you might be curious about a trend that has the potential to chip away at your privacy online. Tracking will bring both big risks and big opportunities in the future. Here’s what it will do. Today we quantify and document an ever-greater amount of our lives, and in the process, we are producing tons of data. If performed accurately, data collection can be then used to customize aspects of our lives to match specific needs, such as creating personalized medicine. But if tracking becomes too invasive, we’ll spend too much time monitoring personal data and little time living our lives. There is also the risk that personal data could be compromised. Businesses or even other people could collect your data from sources such as blogs, social media and apps, using the information against you. Is this frightening to you? Even if it is, this new “transparency” is inevitable. Society will undoubtedly learn to accept it, even enjoying its upsides. While coworkers will be able to track you, you’ll have the option to track them as well – and as a result, everyone will be more accountable. As tracking becomes a larger part of our lives, so will questioning. The future, with its exponential growth of content, will force us to sift through a tremendous amount of information in search of truth. The amount of information society generates doubles every 1.5 years, yet much of it is contradictory and uncertain. For every fact we discover, we’ll find another to dispute it. And remember, plenty of society’s longest-held assumptions have been proven false over time. For instance, we used to assume people would never work for free, but today free intern labor is widespread. The point is, people have begun to question everything, no longer believing in a universal truth but rather in multiple truths assembled from a stream of facts. This desire to question can only grow since every truth or solution produces new questions and as a result, new knowledge. The key message in this book: The future will be shaped by 12 inevitable forces that are emerging today. These are becoming, cognifying, flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, interacting, tracking, questioning and beginning. While these forces are mostly technological in nature, they will touch every aspect of our lives. Despite potential problems, for the most part, we’re facing a future of great opportunity.

There are new products, new designs, new ways of marketing – and the list continues. So what do you do? Well, you keep innovating, which, surely, is what you’re trying to do. Indeed, for decades, people have spent millions and millions of dollars on research and development, all in an attempt to keep up with potential newcomers and incumbents. But that process is somewhat cumbersome, and it’s certainly lengthy and expensive. So how about getting a few tips and tricks on how to innovate with both more speed and less expenditure? In these blinks, you’ll discover how a small team came up with the trackball mouse; why innovators keep the company’s core values in mind; and that discarding your planner mentality is the way to go. True progress is made when people introduce new and novel ideas. Remember what life was like before the telephone was invented? Okay, probably not – but it forever changed the way people communicate. This kind of world-changing innovation continues to take place; it’s just happening in a different way. It used to be well-funded research and development (R&D) departments that created innovative ideas and products. These days, however, innovation is coming from businesses that expand upon successful small-scale experiments. This shift is taking place because the traditional R&D model – a lengthy research phase followed by a team of experts developing an idea from scratch – has proved too complex and costly. This old model can lead to innovation, but it takes massive amounts of analysis and financial assistance. Just consider how much planning and money went into making a basic prototype for a hybrid car or HD television. And for every revolutionary product, there are many more ideas that never see the light of day. In fact, an R&D team might spend millions doing market research only to abandon the idea after it tests poorly with consumers. For these reasons, innovation is now the result of businesses conducting scalable experiments that are inexpensive, simple and less time consuming. Businesses are moving away from the costly analysis of R&D teams to conduct small-scale experiments that test a business hypothesis, or innovative idea, using a variation of the scientific method. Take the innovative ideas behind Windows or the Mac, for example: You might think it was one genius idea that launched these products, but, in reality, each was the result of inexpensive experiments, step-by-step tinkering and imaginative prototypes. This is exactly the kind of innovation that is catching on today: starting out with small-scale, cheap experiments, and then scaling up the development process if the results turn out to be successful. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at this modern method and find out how businesses are conducting these experiments. So what exactly does the modern method for innovation look like? Well, it’s not unlike the method used in chemistry class, where students split up into teams, conduct experiments to solve a problem and present the results to the class. Generally speaking, this kind of method is represented in the 5x5 model. This model works by assembling cross-functional teams of five people, such as a designer, a developer, a marketer, a sales representative and an engineer. Each team is then given five days to develop five ideas that can be tested over the course of five weeks, with each team competing against one another. By using this model, businesses can cut down on time and costs compared to the old analysis-driven R&D model. For instance, imagine you’re a video game company developing a new product. While you’ve made it easy for players to test a sample of the game on your website, many are neglecting to sign up for the newsletter, leaving you wondering how many potential buyers you have. You could tackle this problem by using web surveys – but this isn’t time- or cost-efficient, and it requires a lot of analysis. So you implement the 5x5 method, conducting fast and cheap experiments that you can scale up if the results are good. First, divide your employees into teams of five and let them each develop five ideas. In this case, let’s say the best idea is to change the timing of the newsletter request. You go with this idea and get the five teams to experiment with it. Here’s a possible experiment: ask 50 percent of the users to register before playing and the other 50 percent to register after they’ve played the game for more than two minutes. The results might show that those asked to register immediately were put off and refused, while the majority of the other half did register and formed a reliable group of potential buyers. Whatever the results may be, the 5x5 method is the efficient way to solve your problem. Now that you’re familiar with the 5x5 model, it should be smooth sailing from here on out, right? Well, not so fast. Whenever you introduce change, you should expect some resistance from those who prefer more traditional ways of doing things. And instating the 5x5 model is no exception. A different way of approaching innovation will require a cultural shift within your company. With traditional models, your company might be used to a top-down managerial approach toward planning and delivering proposals that requires a lot of analytical work. Therefore, your top managers might see experiments coming from small teams working from the bottom-up as a backward and ineffective path to innovation. Many of these managers will have a negative view of experimentation, as they equate it with a lack of direction, so they’ll resist the idea of scaling down. That’s why a different mentality is required to implement the 5x5 model and conduct experiments to test business hypotheses. For example, creating and testing new ideas can be difficult when you’re surrounded by people who have a planner mentality. These people won’t seek out new ideas because they put value on what past experience has taught them and tend to believe that they already have the answers to every problem. But remember: it’s experimentation, not experience, that drives innovation. So, instead of a planner mentality, a searcher mentality is needed. Unlike planners, searchers will admit to not having all the answers; they can see the need to run experiments in order to acquire more information. Searchers are also action-oriented. They tend to focus on actionable ideas that can help them quickly turn a good hypothesis into a working prototype. All this makes searchers the perfect type of person to help foster the 5x5 method and bring about innovation in your company. But, as we’ll see in the next blink, having the wrong mentality isn’t the only obstacle to innovation. Life is filled with periods of resistance. At times, life can feel like one big uphill struggle. But by persevering, you can work past resistance, and life once again becomes more manageable and productive. This same kind of resistance is what gets in the way of innovation and the 5x5 model. Luckily, there are simple ways to get around it. First of all, take your plan directly to the executives and let them see the impact 5x5 experiments will potentially have on the company. To avoid resistance, get the executives on your side by showing them how your business hypothesis is connected to the core values and main strengths of the company. Let’s say you’re meeting with the executives of a huge telecom company whose core value is user experience. If you present them with a business hypothesis about enhancing the customer’s user experience, you’re likely to get support – certainly more support than if you were to suggest using the 5x5 method to improve the company’s discount packages. But making the executives feel involved is only part of the solution; if you can make everyone feel involved, there will be no resistance at all. To make this happen, formulate a business hypothesis that assigns a role to every department of the company. When you present this plan, you can show how it mobilizes everyone from sales, marketing and IT to HR and customer service. You’ll soon learn that, if an idea is big enough, it will naturally involve the whole company, and this fact will help legitimize the 5x5 model as a way of testing the hypothesis and creating innovation. This is the kind of big, innovative idea the beauty company Avon had when it suggested turning its customers into salespeople. Getting customers to sell their product was such an enormous strategic shift that it naturally involved every department, from HR to Marketing, to come together and turn the hypothesis into a reality. On any given weekend, you might be feeling lazy enough to binge watch a series on Netflix. And there’s a good chance it might be a series that was recommended to you by Netflix based on a similar series you had enjoyed before. Well, as it turns out, the future of innovation will be just like that: binge experimenting based on binge hypotheses. Not too long from now, business experiments will be suggested to 5x5 teams by intelligent recommendation engines. Just like Netflix, companies like Amazon and Spotify also help customers by recommending items and products that match their user profile or previous shopping, watching or listening decisions. This same idea can be applied to business experiments and the hypotheses that get them going. But rather than getting recommendations for new songs or movies, 5x5 teams will get recommendations for what hypothesis to test next. For example, the engine might say, “Account managers who tested this hypothesis also tested…” or, “Marketing designers who tested this hypothesis also tested…” Even better, all of this will happen automatically through artificial intelligence (AI). And this engine won’t just use information collected from human behavior, like current recommendation systems; it will be fully automated artificial intelligence. It might sound far out, but people are actually using this technology right now. The sciences are already employing AI to design experiments that are later published in major scientific journals. Just take Adam from the United Kingdom. Adam is a fully automated robot that generates scientific hypotheses and experiments regarding the genome of baker’s yeast. This is the same technology that will one day be applied to business experiments. Humans will still be the main factor in these experiments, but the teams will have AI to support them and help them come up with the next hypothesis that will lead to world-changing innovation. The key message in this book: Business experiments are a cheap, quick and simple way to generate smarter, better, safer and more scalable innovation that will benefit companies and their customers’ future.  Actionable advice: Don’t forget to act. As the great economist Joseph Schumpeter said, “Innovation is less an act of intellect than an act of will.” Think about a business hypothesis but don’t stop at the idea of the hypothesis.

Malone","summary":"Businesses across the globe are constantly searching for that visionary leader who can turn a company into a global player, a personality who can guide a firm through tough times to future success. The truth is that many companies fail because such a leader cannot be found. Global technology company Intel, however, had great leadership. Yet its strength rested not in one leader, but in three – men who today are considered some of the greatest business minds of the twentieth century. These blinks show you how the complementary skills and abilities of Gordon Moore, Bob Noyce and Andy Grove allowed Intel to massively outpace the competition. In these blinks you’ll discover why Intel’s visionary leaders needed a “business brain” too; which of Intel’s top brass was terrified of sacking employees; and why three is truly a magic number. Regardless of a tech device’s outside appearance, like your smartphone or laptop, it needs microprocessors inside to function. The microprocessor is perhaps the most important technological invention of our modern world, and its development is largely due to an incredibly influential company, Intel. In fact, the impact of the microprocessor has been so significant that Intel could be considered the most important company in the world. For the last 40 years, Intel has been at the forefront of the microprocessor industry, managing tough competition from companies such as Hewlett-Packard. And it has been very successful. In 2000, Intel was valued at almost $500 billion, a valuation larger than the American car sector combined. At the time, these kinds of numbers just weren’t seen in the tech industry. Only Apple has come close, and many years later. So what was Intel’s secret? Many point to the personalities in the company’s boardroom. According to management theorist Peter Drucker, top CEOs need three character traits to succeed: good with people, thoughtful and willing to take action. Intel didn’t have one CEO that embodied all three characteristics. But it did have three unique individuals, and each person embodied one of Drucker’s necessary traits. Robert Noyce was the people man; Gordon Moore was the thinker; and Andy Grove the man of action. Together, these men formed a powerful troika, complementing each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Together, they transformed Intel into one of the most successful companies of all time. Every great company requires a charismatic, visionary leader, someone who can both come up with superb ideas and communicate effectively to get people to follow through on those ideas. Bob Noyce was the “people person” of the Intel trinity. His strong points were charisma, vision and scientific brilliance. Noyce placed a lot of importance on being loved. He would listen to everyone and was patient. His willingness to listen won him the affections of all stakeholders, be they customers, shareholders, investors, the media or government. But his charisma wasn’t to be outdone by his scientific brilliance. In fact, he co-invented the integrated circuit, one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century. Both Noyce’s charisma and scientific talents combined well with his ability to keep a big-picture perspective. He wasn’t afraid to rethink whole industries, which made him a legendary leader. For example, at Fairchild, the company Noyce and Gordon Moore left to found Intel, Noyce released a chip for $1, much less than the chip cost to produce at the time. His genius was his ability to foresee that the same chips would actually cost even less to produce in a couple of years, as technology progressed. By enticing customers with low prices, he could capture more of them in the early phases, and then make more money from them later, once production costs fell. This strategy became known as learning curve pricing, the standard pricing strategy in the tech sector. For all his positives, Noyce was also non-confrontational, indecisive and lacked essential management skills. He just couldn’t say “no” and avoided conflict as much as possible. Though he was famous for hiring the best talent, he couldn’t bring himself to fire an employee, even when the survival of the company was at stake. When he was forced to lay off 3,500 people due to mismanagement, he gave up his position as CEO and became chairman instead, thus removing himself from such tough decision-making. Opposites often attract, and this was equally true at Intel. Alongside the bold, charismatic Noyce worked the modest, bookish Gordon Moore.   Being a man of thought, Moore’s qualities were scientific prowess and precision, mixed with modesty. As the technical leader at Intel, Moore developed the eponymous Moore’s Law, which states that the number of components per integrated circuit doubles every year, thus reducing its cost in relation to its performance. Moore’s Law became the guiding force of the tech industry, the pulse that dictated progress and innovation and the key element around which Intel’s strategy and products would revolve. As a person, Moore was self-effacing and ego-free. In contrast with Noyce’s very physical presence, Moore had more of a spiritual one. To him, only technological advancement and scientific integrity mattered. Even after having become billionaires, Moore and his wife didn’t significantly change their lifestyle. For example, conversation at the dinner table with Moore revolved around geology and fishing rather than business or money. However, Moore suffered the same shortcomings as Noyce. He too was a manager unable to make day-to-day business decisions, and the research and development departments he ran at both Fairchild and Intel were undisciplined and chaotic. Andy Grove would say of Moore that, while he could answer almost any technical question quickly and accurately, he couldn’t resolve conflicts between people. Moore was sometimes unable to defend even his own point of view, despite often being correct. So with Moore in the lab working on breakthrough technologies and Noyce acting as the connection to the outside world, the team still needed a savvy, business-minded partner who could get things done. Enter Andy Grove. If Noyce and Moore were the technological visionaries, then Grove was the businessman who could harness their lofty ideas and make them a success. Grove is the last piece of the Intel trinity: the man of action. He was decisive, empirical, brutally honest and extremely well-organized, all of which helped Intel to operate at light speed and ahead of the competition. To outperform competitor Motorola, for example, Grove implemented “Operation Crush,” a cutting-edge marketing strategy designed to surpass Motorola’s efforts in just a couple of months. As chief operating officer, Grove reviewed and validated his strategy in just a week. The next week, he presented the plan to 100 salespeople. And by the following week, Grove had rounded up more than 1,000 employees to execute the plan. His business skills would also play an important role in Intel’s success with microprocessors. Although the decision to jump into the business was made without him and he was absolutely against it, he nevertheless used his skills to take the company to new heights. Grove was also wary and temperamental. Unlike Noyce and Moore, he wasn’t one of Intel’s founding members. He was an employee with a salary, and his financial stability hinged on the success of the company. This made him wary of risky strategies. It was this fear that made him so skeptical of the company’s move into microprocessors. He wanted Intel to stick to its bread and butter, which was memory chips. Thankfully, he wasn’t able to stop Moore and Noyce, who knew the move was the correct one. Had Grove quashed the idea, Intel certainly would not have become the success it turned out to be.   This is how the trinity worked. Noyce and Moore would bring together vision, confidence and technological expertise to formulate a strategy over the long term, and Grove would use his management skills to enact the plan in an efficient way. Yet the alliance wasn’t without its problems, as you’ll find out in our next blink. There’s no question that putting such vastly different personalities in a room is bound to result in a clash or two. Noyce and Moore deeply trusted one another, and Grove looked up to Moore as a mentor and scientific sage. However, Grove resented Noyce for putting on airs and being irresponsible, and in general, not caring about day-to-day business needs. Noyce would evade conflicts at meetings and act aloof, as if he wasn’t concerned about the business at hand. This enraged Grove and fueled his contempt for Noyce. According to Grove, Noyce would take on a pained look when there were conflicts, and would do anything he could to avoid them – not the behavior of a serious businessperson! For example, when Noyce decided to pursue the microprocessor project, he clearly should have talked to Grove. Perhaps fearing a potential conflict, he ignored him instead, breaking every management rule in the book to make a seriously big decision all on his own. Ultimately, Moore would often have to act as a mediator between Grove and Noyce. Yet the two men were able to put their feelings aside in the end to fully concentrate efforts to grow Intel’s businesses. Even though Grove was furious at Noyce for having initiated the microprocessor project without his knowledge, he was still the one who made it successful with his business wizardry. Noyce knew that Grove disliked him, but he nonetheless agreed that Grove should eventually become CEO. Noyce even put Grove in charge of the microprocessor launch. Noyce simply recognized that Grove was the only person who could align Intel’s operations with his own grand vision. The strong personalities of Noyce, Moore and Grove set a powerful example for the rest of the company, creating a revolutionary corporate culture that would lead to success. Since 1968, Intel’s organizational structure has been characterized by a flat hierarchy and openness. Executives didn’t get special privileges, such as executive dining rooms or reserved parking spaces. In fact, one of Intel’s top executives once got angry at his wife for showing up to the company campus in the couple’s expensive Mercedes. From that point on, he was only seen driving an ordinary sedan. Communication within the company was informal and lateral, and moved easily throughout the organizational structure. Any employee could walk up to an executive’s desk – no fancier than any other – and talk about his ideas. One example of this open communication is the chat between employee Ted Hoff and Robert Noyce about what would later become the microprocessor. At the time, Intel was struggling in the memory chip business; Noyce was intrigued with the idea and told Hoff to pursue his research. However, an informal workplace was just a characteristic of Intel’s ultimate goal: to be a peerless innovator, the best in the world and ferociously successful. It was this drive that caused Intel to introduce the standard 80-hour workweek to Silicon Valley. “Creative confrontation” was also the norm. Everything was permitted, so long as the behavior or action solved a company problem and secured its competitive position. Personal attacks were tolerated; people were shouted down at meetings. At Intel, if you made a mistake you knew it and were reminded of it ruthlessly. The next day you would work twice as hard, however, and everything would be forgotten. This mix of drive to be the best and a flat hierarchy made it possible for Intel to quickly adjust to new challenges. Its pride and confidence led it to take risks, and yet it always found a way to grow stronger. The key message in this book: Great success is defined by great people. With Intel, success was based on the partnership among three men, whose distinct personalities and strong desire to succeed were unmatched.

Maybe more astounding is how little teaching the brain requires while it’s undergoing this transformation. No machine in the history of mankind has a learning capacity comparable to the human brain. But things are changing. Our ability to create ever more sophisticated machines means that, in the future, they may be able to challenge the brain. Machines may even surpass human ability. They can learn from the enormous amounts of data that we encounter and ignore every day. So let's put on our thinking caps and explore the fascinating world of algorithms and machine learning. In these blinks, you’ll find out how machines will be able to learn without instruction in the future; why seeing patterns sometimes is a problem; and how an algorithm for winning Tetris could improve your route to work. Have you ever been frustrated by recipes with imprecise instructions, like, “cook at medium heat for 15-20 minutes”? If so, you might be someone who prefers a good algorithm. Unlike recipes, algorithms are sequences of precise instructions that produce the same result every time. Though you might not be aware of their presence, algorithms are used everywhere. They schedule flights, route the packages you send and make sure factories run smoothly. These standard algorithms are designed to accept information as an input, then perform a task and produce an output. Let’s say an algorithm’s task is to give directions. When you input two points, the output would then be the shortest route between these two points. But machine learning, or ML, algorithms are one step more abstract: they are algorithms that output other algorithms! Given lots of examples of input-output pairs to learn from, they find an algorithm that seems to turn the inputs into the outputs. This comes in handy for finding algorithms for tasks that human programmers can’t precisely describe, such as reading someone’s handwriting. Like riding a bike, deciphering handwriting is something we do unconsciously. We would have trouble putting our process into words, let alone into an algorithm. Thanks to machine learning, we don’t have to. We just give a machine learning algorithm lots of examples of handwritten text as input, and the meaning of the text as the desired output. The result will be an algorithm that can transform one into the other. Once learned, we can then use that algorithm whenever we want to automatically decipher handwriting. And, indeed, that’s how the post office is able to read the zip code you write down on your packages. What’s great is that ML algorithms like this one can be used for many different tasks, and solving emergent problems is only a matter of collecting enough data. This means that the initial underlying algorithm is often the same and requires no adjustments in order to solve seemingly unrelated problems. For example, you might think that making a medical diagnosis, filtering spam from your email and figuring out the best chess move might all need completely different algorithms. But, actually, with one ML algorithm and the right kind of data, you can solve all these problems. To hallucinate is to see something that isn’t really there. Interestingly enough, hallucinations are a central problem in the world of algorithms. In 1998, a best-selling book, The Bible Code, claimed that the Bible contained hidden predictions that were revealed by selectively skipping certain lines and letters. Critics disproved this assertion, however, by demonstrating that similar “patterns” could be found in Moby Dick and within Supreme Court rulings. This is a good example of hallucinating patterns, which, in ML lingo, is the result of overfitting. Overfitting takes place when an algorithm is so powerful that it can “learn” anything. You see, when you throw enough computing power at a data set like the Bible, you will always find patterns because the computer can construct increasingly complex models until some arise. But the resulting model won’t work on any other data. So, to get your algorithms under control, their power needs to be bounded by limiting their complexity. With the right kind of limiting restrictions, you make sure the scope of your algorithm isn’t too big and ensure that the results are verifiable and consistent. If it’s too flexible, your algorithm can end up like The Bible Code, finding patterns in any given text or set of data. But what if your algorithm discovers multiple patterns that explain the data you have but disagree on new data? Which result should you believe? And how can you be 100 percent sure your results aren’t just a fluke? This is when holdout data comes in. When you are preparing your original data set for the learning algorithm, it is important to divide it into a training set, which the algorithm uses to learn, and a holdout set, against which to test it. This way you can double-check the results and confirm that the patterns found in the data are valid. Ensuring the validity of the results is what an ML expert’s work is all about. Her job is to restrict the power of the algorithm by making sure the rules are not too flexible and that the results perform well against both the training-set data and the holdout-set data. Just as the medical world has specialists who have preferred ways of treating the body, the world of machine learning has specialized branches with their own perspectives and preferred style of algorithms. Symbolists, for example, manipulate symbols and learn rules in order to create artificial intelligence (AI). Symbolists are the oldest branch of the AI community; they’re rationalists who view the senses as unreliable, and therefore believe that all intelligence must be learned through logical methods. For this reason, the symbolists’ preferred algorithm is inverse deduction. Generally speaking, inverse deduction creates rules by linking separate statements, like this: If you provide two statements, such as “Napoleon is human” and “Therefore Napoleon is mortal,” the algorithm can arrive at broader statements, such as “Humans are mortal.” While this kind of algorithm is good for data mining and sorting through relatively large amounts of data, such as medical records, it is costly and inefficient for truly massive databases because it has to consider all possible relationships between all variables in the data, which results in exponentially growing complexity. So, to make this work less complex, you can use decision trees to find these rules. As the name suggests, decision trees branch the data off into smaller sets. They do this by basically playing a game of 20 questions, with each question or rule further narrowing down the options and possibilities. For example, if you wanted to come up with rules for sifting through medical records, you could use a decision tree. You’d start out with all of the records, but then, at the various branching points in the tree, you’d divide them into groups like “healthy,” “leukemia,” “lung cancer” and so forth. The ML algorithm would then find suitable rules that would also result in this division. This method prevents overfitting by restricting the number of questions the decision tree asks, so that only the most widely applicable and general rules are applied. Decision trees are used in software that make medical diagnoses by narrowing down someone’s symptoms. They were also used in an application that could predict the outcome of Supreme Court rulings with a 75-percent accuracy rate; the predictions from a panel of human experts had an accuracy rate of less than 60 percent. In the next blink, we’ll see how to deal with data of a more difficult, and more human, sort – data that’s uncertain or even contradictory. Bayesianism is another popular branch of machine learning, and its followers are practically religious in their devotion. Contrary to the rationalists, Bayesians are empiricists who believe that logical reasoning is flawed and that true intelligence comes from observation and experimentation. Their algorithm of choice is called Bayesian inference, which works by keeping a number of different hypotheses or models open simultaneously. The degree to which we believe in any one of these hypotheses or models will vary depending on the evidence found in the data, as some will invariably receive more support than others. This approach can also help provide a medical diagnosis. While remaining open to many hypothetical diseases and their symptoms, the algorithm can sift through the data of a patient’s record to make the best match. The more data the record provides, the more diseases the algorithm can rule out, until one hypothesis becomes the statistical winner. Bayesian inference is a powerful algorithm, and it prevents overfitting by restricting assumptions about causes and events. For example, if it is apparent that you have the flu but we want to find out if you also have a fever or a cough, we can categorize the flu as a cause and the fever or cough as events. The restricting assumption here is to assume that the two events do not influence each other, meaning that a cough does not affect your chances of also getting a fever. By ignoring the possible connections between events, Bayesian inference avoids overfitting and becoming too powerful by strictly focusing on the connection between cause and effect. Similar assumptions are used by voice-recognition software like Siri. When you say, “Call the police!” the Bayesian inference keeps options open and considers how likely it is that you might have said, “Call the please!” But when checking its database of popular phrases, it is enough to look at the frequency of how often certain words follow one another. And, in this case, it is clear that “police” follows the word “the” far more often than “please.” Have you ever noticed how you can hear when someone says your name, even if it’s said quietly and you’re surrounded by dozens of loudly talking people? We have an impressive ability to filter the information our ears pick up and focus on. Could an algorithm learn to do the same thing? As a matter of fact, unsupervised learning is a category of algorithms that are designed to use raw and noisy data. The algorithms in the previous blinks have all used data containing labeled examples to learn from, such as examples of correct diagnoses or emails that have been labeled as spam or non-spam. However, clustering algorithms are one group of unsupervised learners that can discover categories from large amounts of raw data. This is the kind of algorithm that can be used in image recognition or voice isolation software, which can identify a face or object among millions of pixels, or single out a voice in a noisy crowd. These algorithms can find meaningful structures like these by reducing the dimensionality of the data by bringing the description of what you’re looking for down to its primary essentials. Sketch artists, for instance, are able to reproduce faces with such accuracy because they memorize ten different variations of each facial feature – nose, eyes, ears and so on. This narrows their options down considerably, making it possible to produce a passable drawing based on a description alone. Similarly, facial recognition algorithms, after preprocessing all the different options, only need to compare a few hundred variables rather than a million pixels. Neural networks are another effective way to crunch massive amounts of raw data. While other algorithms process data sequentially, neural networks work like a brain and process multiple inputs at the same time. One of the biggest neural networks ever created spent three days sifting through ten million randomly selected YouTube videos. And without being told what to look out for, the program learned to recognize human faces and, perhaps unsurprisingly, cats. Now that you know about all these different algorithms, you’ve surely begun to wonder what would happen if they were all combined into a master algorithm. Well, let’s find out. So, with all these different algorithms, you might be asking, which one’s the best? The truth is, there’s no such thing as a perfect algorithm; they all rely on different fundamental assumptions. Remarkably, for every data set where an algorithm comes up with something useful, a devil’s advocate could use the same algorithm on another data set to show that everything it does is nonsensical. That’s why it’s important to make the right assumptions about the data you’re applying the algorithm to. Luckily, this isn’t as big of an issue as it might seem. The majority of the most difficult problems in computer science are fundamentally related and could be solved with one good algorithm. Just consider some problems that have already been solved: Determining the shortest route to visit several cities, compressing data, controlling urban traffic flow, turning 2D images into 3D shapes, laying out components on a microchip and, last but not least, playing Tetris. Discovering an efficient solution for one of these problems essentially solved them all. It might be hard to believe that one algorithm can address so much, but it’s true and it’s considered one of the most fascinating insights in all of computer science. Unfortunately, the most important problems facing humanity require much more capable algorithms than are currently available. For example, in order to come up with a cure for cancer, the ultimate algorithm needs to incorporate all the previously acquired knowledge, plus be able to keep up with the quick rate at which new scientific discoveries are being published. On top of that, it would need to consider the relevance of all of this data and discern an overarching structure that no one has yet been able to see. While this is currently beyond the capability of algorithms, progress is being made. Take Adam, for instance – a research robot at the Institute of Biology in Manchester that has learned general knowledge about genetics and can suggest hypotheses. It can even design and carry out experiments as well as test and analyze their results! “Data is the new oil,” or at least so say the modern business prophets. It’s hard to argue against, too, because, in the world of big business, many feel that the company with the best algorithms is the company that’s going to win. In the pre-internet era, if a business had problems connecting with consumers, it could solve them with a physical solution, like coming up with a better ad campaign. But with the internet came virtually unlimited consumer choice, and now the question is: How do you decide what to buy when there are 10 million options? This is where machine learning comes in and helps narrow things down. Amazon has led the race in offering intelligent suggestions on what products customers might like, and their service covers just about every market. But the race is still on. And whoever has the best data can come up with the best algorithm, which is why data is a tremendous strategic asset. The average value of a user’s data trail for the online advertising industry is around $1,200 per year. Google’s data on you goes for about $20, while Facebook’s costs $5. The business of buying data has become so big that experts believe data unions and data banks will eventually allow private citizens and companies to conduct fair negotiations about the use of their data. Databanks could keep your information secure and also allow you to set the terms for when and how it is accessed. And a data union could operate like other worker unions, with like-minded people joining forces to ensure that information is being used fairly and accurately. This kind of regulation could benefit everyone. It could help businesses, by improving their algorithms; you could get better purchase recommendations; and, with the extra security, more people might feel comfortable sharing their data to help advance medical and humanitarian causes. Chances are you’ve been caught talking to yourself at one point or another. Well, if you’ve ever wished you could talk back to yourself, your dreams may soon come true. By sharing all your data with the ultimate master learning algorithm you will end up with a pretty accurate digital model of yourself. Imagine the master algorithm: Seeded with a database containing all general human knowledge, then personalized with all the data that you’ve collected over the course of your life, including emails, phone records, web searches, purchases, downloads, health records, GPS directions and so on and so on. You could then download the learned-model digital version of yourself onto a flash drive, carry it with you in your pocket and use it like a personal butler to help you run your life. With your very own digital you, little annoyances could be quickly dealt with, saving you time and hassle. In addition to simple things like automated web searches and recommending new books and movies, it could also file your tax returns, pay your credit-card bills, sort your email, plan your vacations and, if you’re single, it could even set you up on dates. Or, if you’re feeling introspective, you could set it to a conversation mode and have a chat with your digital model. In a society where digital models are a common thing, it could even interact with the rest of the world on your behalf. Imagine you are looking for a new job. After spending a second on LinkedIn, your model could apply for every suitable job available, including some perfect jobs you might have otherwise overlooked. Those companies might have personal models as well, and your digital self could interact with them and provide you with a list of every company that agreed to a personal interview. All you’d have to do is confirm your appointment. Your digital self will be like power steering: you’ll get where you want to go with less hassle and a fraction of the effort. The key message in this book: Machine learning algorithms are universal problem solvers that need only a few assumptions and a whole lot of data to work their magic. Unifying the current branches of machine learning into one ultimate master algorithm would advance humanity like no other single event in history. Even as it stands today, advanced algorithms and access to personal data are already crucial for businesses to be competitive.  Actionable advice: Be aware of your data trail. Every digital interaction has two levels, getting you what you want and teaching the computer a little bit more about yourself. The second one will be more important over the long-term, since it will be used both to serve you, by helping you perform tasks, and also to manipulate you, by showing you ads and recommendations likely to make you buy. So be aware. If you don't want a current internet session to influence your personalization, go to incognito mode. And if you don't want your kids to be shown YouTube suggestions and ads based on your history, make sure to use different accounts. Got feedback?

With its rise the world has become radically more connected and globalized. Many Western thinkers believe that this connectivity will offer a whole new opportunity to spread democracy and freedom all across the planet: If people in authoritarian countries just had the ability to inform themselves about how life is better in democratic countries, democracy would spread automatically, wouldn’t it? While this is a tempting vision, reality disagrees. The internet can be a force for good, but both authoritarian and democratic regimes have learned to manipulate the internet to fight for their slice of the globalized pie. In these blinks, you’ll learn how in some parts of the world, a simple “Like” on Facebook can get you arrested. You’ll also find out how authoritarian regimes use the internet to spread propaganda. Finally, you’ll discover why 1.7 million supporters on Facebook are incapable of raising $20,000 for a good cause. What caused the fall of the Berlin Wall? Some argue that the informative power of Western radio played a key role. This creates hope that the internet will play a similar part in the collapse of modern authoritarian regimes – but in fact, the internet is not comparable to radio, and historical events can’t be simply translated to the present. This is because the fall of the Berlin Wall was a unique historical situation in which the power of radio came to the fore. Before the radio was invented, there was no way for people to obtain information from independent sources. Regimes could easily control other mass media like newspapers and cinema, but not the open airwaves of the radio, which allowed people living in the German Democratic Republic – the Soviet part of Germany during the Cold War – to learn about what was going on outside their country. This new information led to more and more dissatisfaction with the regime, and eventually to the protests that brought down the Wall. But even if the Internet is like the radio in some ways, the idea that it possesses the same political power is false. Why? Because the internet is easily manipulated. Contrary to what many Western politicians think, the internet does not help overthrow modern dictators. They believe that like the radio, the internet will allow people living under authoritarian regimes to inform themselves about life in the Western world, and realize that life is better elsewhere. According to this line of thought, this awareness will eventually lead to a revolution within the repressive regime. But what they don’t realize is that unlike radio, access to the internet can be easily manipulated by authoritarian regimes. While the leaders of the GDR couldn’t prevent their citizens from listening to radio channels from West Germany, modern dictators maintain control over the internet. It’s tempting to think that the information available on the internet is the ultimate weapon against political oppression – but unfortunately, reality disagrees. In fact, the internet also helps support authoritarian regimes. One reason for this is that internet bloggers can both be supporters as well as critics of authoritarian regimes. Just as most Western bloggers who write about politics typically promote Western values, most bloggers from authoritarian regimes support the nationalistic and xenophobic values of their home regime – and often more virulently than the regime’s own propaganda machine. Authoritarian regimes can then encourage the bloggers who support them. For example, Maksim Kononenko, a conservative blogger from Russia who supports the government, even got to co-host his own prime-time TV show. And other bloggers affiliated with the Kremlin also get support from the Russian government. The internet also allows critics of authoritarian regimes to be easily spotted. Before the internet, opponents of governments organized in the underground. They held secret meetings to plan their protests, which made it hard for the government to find them. This is why in the German Democratic Republic, the Stasi – the official state security service – invested so much energy into monitoring citizens with bugs and informers. But with the internet, it’s a lot easier to monitor citizens – and therefore prevent protests. Not only can governments spy on their citizens with programs installed on their computers, as we’ll see in a later blink, they can also track down dissidents with the help of social networks like Facebook. A simple click on the “Like” button of a critical video can turn a person into a target for political suppression. And when supporters of the regime with whom you are “friends” notice activity they consider “dodgy,” they can inform the government. Do you think that only authoritarian regimes like China censor and manipulate the internet? In fact, Western governments do the same. Western governments use the internet to track down radicals and criminals in the same way that authoritarian regimes track down dissidents. For example, they attempt to shut down radical websites like far left or far right message boards, and track down their visitors and operators. But this doesn’t stop Western politicians complaining about the censorship and persecutions of political opponents in countries like China and Russia. For example, they demand that the blockage of certain websites like Google should stop. So even though the ideals that lead to censoring extremists might be noble, it’s hard to believe in Western governments’ idea of internet freedom if they don’t practice what they preach. Another way certain US-led Western governments manipulate the internet is by attempting to provoke riots against dictators. When dissidents make use of the internet to organize their protests, Western regimes are happy to support them. For example, prior to the Iranian protests of 2009, the United States had imposed many sanctions against Iran, including the blocking of websites belonging to American companies. But when the protests broke out, American diplomats decided to loosen the sanctions, and allow Iranians access to American social networking websites like Twitter and Facebook. This in turn allowed the protestors to better organize themselves. Why did the United States loosen the internet embargo? Not because relations with Iran had improved. They did it to support the opponents of the Iranian government – which was in fact in their own interests. This is a clear example of how Western policymakers make use of their domestic industries – and especially internet companies – to advance their own foreign policies. Everyone knows that the internet makes it easier for people to connect with one another. But while some use the internet to organize Harry Potter meet-ups, other users with bad intentions connect with similarly minded people to organize for malicious purposes. For example, criminals and narrow-minded people use the internet to connect with peers like everybody else. Thanks to the internet’s anonymity, people can express their secret dreams and desires online and connect with others in a way that’s never been possible before. But this anonymity also means that criminals, racists and nationalists can organize themselves via the internet. Because the internet makes it easy to hide one’s identity, people can easily spread their undemocratic and intolerant thoughts without fearing the repercussions. For example, there are platforms on the internet for hiring assassins, and message boards for planning attacks on homosexuals. In Western countries, these kinds of platforms are often censored. But in authoritarian countries, intolerant people are not prevented from organizing via the internet – as long as their opinions support the government. For example, in Saudi Arabia, Islamists who demand that the national law becomes Sharia based are not hindered from sharing their ideas. Sharia law is criticized by human rights organizations for – among other reasons – demanding the death penalty for homosexual activities. In this way, groups with anti-Western views can freely organize online – as long as they support the regime – while dissidents struggle to connect via the internet. Modern dictators know where to suppress and where not to suppress on the internet. This way they indirectly strengthen their supporters, and weaken government opponents. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how authoritarian regimes manipulate the internet. With billions of web pages online and millions more added every day, you could think that it’s nearly impossible to censor the internet. This is true in terms of mechanical censorship – but with the help of well written programs, modern regimes can achieve the impossible. This is thanks to modern software that allows predictive and automatic censorship. In many types of media, censorship has to be done manually: people must be paid to watch every program and read every article or book to decide whether it is appropriate for the society. And until the early twenty-first century, this also applied to the internet. But lately, more and more sophisticated programs have appeared, which go beyond manually blocking access to a given list of websites. These programs can analyze what the user is doing and automatically guess if his behavior is allowed or not. For example, if there is too much fleshy pink on a website, it is automatically classified as having pornographic content – and blocked. And using their considerable powers, dictators can force their people to install this kind of censorship program on their computers. This is because people living in authoritarian regimes are not free to buy the products they want. In Communist states it is easy for the government to force the people to buy computers with pre-installed censorship programs. For example, the Chinese government announced in 2009 that all computers sold in the country had to have the software GreenDam installed – a program that tracks the user’s activity, reports back suspicious behavior to a database and blocks “unwanted” content. The internet can be a powerful weapon in the struggle against authoritarian regimes. But the same regimes can also wield the internet to counter dissidents with their own propaganda. For example, in authoritarian countries like Venezuela, websites like Twitter and Facebook are not only used by critics of the government, but also by the government itself. While many dictators initially tried to fight or ignore the internet, they’ve now realized its potential for propaganda, and have learned to use it for their own purposes. Venezuela’s late president, Hugo Chavez, was one authoritarian leader who tried to ignore the internet for a long time. But when he finally decided to join Twitter, he attracted 50,000 followers within 24 hours, and 500,000 within one month. By finally taking advantage of the internet’s power, he was able to easily spread his authoritarian views – and become more popular at the same time. Another way authoritarian countries spread propaganda through the internet is by backing key websites that are in direct competition with important Western websites. In most Western countries, websites like Google, Facebook and YouTube are by far the most popular. But this is not true for countries like Russia and China. In Russia, vk.com – a Russian version of Facebook owned by a Russian company – is far more popular than Facebook, and in China, baidu.com – a Chinese search engine like Google – is the most visited website in the country. Why is this dangerous? Because it’s easier for authoritarian states to control and manipulate websites owned by their own countries, which gives them direct control over what can be seen on the web – and therefore their citizens. Everyone has been sent an email asking for signatures for an online petition. But when people support a cause online they may think that that gesture alone was enough – and that they don’t have to engage with the issue directly. For example, people can support a political cause by joining a group on social networks like Facebook. Psychologists have found that just joining one of these groups makes politically minded people as happy as writing a letter to their elected representatives – a method of political activism that’s actually effective. So what’s the problem? The problem is that although it makes people happy, this internet activism has no real impact in the vast majority of cases. But because internet activists have become satisfied by enacting their civic responsibilities online – or so they believe – they are less likely to express their protest in more effective, and sometimes more dangerous ways – like going into the streets. For example, the Facebook group Saving the Children of Africa has over 1.7 million members, but the organization has only managed to raise about $12,000 – less than one-hundredth of a penny per person. Besides discouraging people from showing their opposition in the offline world, the internet can also prevent people from even thinking about what is wrong in their country. For example, the internet allows people to obsess about things which are only important to themselves. For instance, the most popular terms on Russian search engines are not “what is democracy,” but rather “what is love” or “how do I lose weight.” This shows that people are more interested in things that happen in their own bubble, rather than the politics that affect everybody. And authoritarian regimes directly distract people from their political situation by supporting websites that produce apolitical entertainment. Russia.ru, for example, a website supported by the Russian government, produces more than two dozen regular video shows about frivolous topics such as a search for the perfect breasts in Moscow’s nightclubs. Remember that offline protests are normally far more effective than showing your protest online. The key message in this book: The internet does not only help to spread democracy and freedom – it can also distract its users from politics, distribute anti-democratic propaganda and allow intolerant groups to organize themselves. But authoritarian regimes aren’t the only guilty parties: Western governments also manipulate and censor the internet as they see fit.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

It rules modern markets, having replaced MP3 players, cameras and palm pilots with one handheld miracle. But this device’s story is deeper and more complex than is immediately apparent. The iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone. It rests on the shoulders of countless other innovations, including phones, voice-recognition tools and touch-screen technology. And the innovators who paved the way for the iPhone aren’t the only unsung heroes in this tale; there are also the millions of workers worldwide who toil in abominable South American mines and Chinese mega factories. In these blinks, you’ll learn why Steve Jobs can’t really be credited with inventing the iPhone; the horrible reality behind the raw materials used to manufacture the iPhone; and that the iPhone’s roots reach back to an early twentieth-century Swedish inventor. Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last ten years, you know that the iPhone is a colossal success. Indeed, it’s so successful that, in 2016, when technology-industry expert Horace Dediu made a list of the world’s top products, he listed the iPhone as not only the best-selling phone, but the best-selling camera, music player, video player and computer. The phone has sold one billion units. To give some perspective, that’s 550 million more units than the mega-hit Harry Potter series sold. Not just that, but when Wall Street analysts took stock of the most profitable products in the world, the iPhone was one of the top items on their list as well. It was even one place above Marlboro cigarettes, one of the biggest manufacturers of one of the world’s most addictive products. So the iPhone is ludicrously popular. But why? Most people attribute its success to Steve Jobs, the man often given sole credit for its invention. However, the history of the iPhone truly begins in the early 2000s with a small group of Apple employees who were secretly experimenting with human-computer interfaces. The group contained a few software designers and input engineers and one industrial designer, all of whom met, without Job’s knowledge, to experiment with unconventional user interfaces. Among them was Joshua Strickon, who’d recently received his PhD from MIT Media Lab. He was a wiz with human-computer interaction and touch-based technology software. Alongside Strickon were people who pioneered the field itself, like Greg Christie, head of the Human Interface team and a lead force on Apple’s handheld mobile device, the Personal Digital Assistant. Other crucial people in the team were designers Imran Chaudhri and Bas Ording. One member of the original iPhone team described them as “the Lennon and McCartney of user interface design.” The group collectively believed that the traditional keyboard and mouse were outmoded. So they set out to enable more direct interaction with computers and explored motion sensors and multitouch technology in particular. After months of tinkering, they produced the first, very low-tech prototype of what would eventually become the iPhone. However, they certainly weren’t the first to delve into such technology. You might be surprised to hear that the original precursor of the iPhone is quite old – over a century old, to be exact. The first mobile phone was made in 1910 by the Swedish inventor Lars Magnus Ericsson, who later founded the tech giant Ericsson. To be fair, this mobile device was a car phone and to function it actually had to be directly connected to telephone lines using a wire. But it led to the invention of an even more mobile device in 1917. This second iteration was made by a Finnish inventor named Eric Tigerstedt and it was truly wireless. It was a flip phone with certain similarities to modern mobile phones, featuring a thin, minimalist aesthetic. But despite these early innovations, mobile phones didn’t catch on until the 1980s and it wasn’t until the 1990s that the first “smartphone” was produced. That’s right, decades before the iPhone, Frank Canova Jr., then an engineer at IBM, produced the Simon Personal Communicator, or the Simon for short. It was the first mobile phone that featured a computer. And therein lay the actual innovation of the product: it boasted a touchscreen and applications, the features that made it “smart.” In fact, Canova’s initial goal was to add all manner of apps, like GPS and a stock ticker. He even developed some of them, but in the end the hard drive of the device couldn’t support them all. With the few apps and games the phone came with, it was already as big as a brick. This was a major issue in creating a popular smartphone; the technology just wasn’t there yet and the issue of size also explains why the Simon’s successor, the Neon, never even went to market. Nonetheless, these early innovations were important inspirations for the inventors of the iPhone, two decades down the line. One of the most remarkable things about the iPhone is its battery capacity. Interestingly, the technology behind this super battery has somewhat unusual origins. It dates to the oil crisis of the 1970s, when prices were soaring and the public was getting uneasy – and scientists everywhere were asking whether there might be a way to decrease dependence on oil. This fear resulted in greater alternative-energy research. Exxon, for instance, hired a brilliant Stanford University chemist, Stan Whittingham, whose job it was to find new energy sources. And his work broke new ground. At the time, the most common batteries were made of zinc and carbon. Panasonic had recently produced a lithium-based battery, but it wasn’t rechargeable. Today, the lithium battery in the iPhone is rechargeable, and we have researchers like Whittingham and the brilliant physicist John Goodenough, to thank for it. Here’s how it works: When a battery is used, electrical current in the form of electrons travels through an electrolyte from one electrode – the anode – to another, the cathode. If the battery is capable of being recharged, an energy source, say a wall outlet, reverses the flow of current. Essentially, it causes energy to travel back to where it came from, making the battery reusable. However, in his early experiments, Whittingham was experiencing some serious issues; namely, his batteries kept overheating and catching fire. Luckily, John Goodenough solved the problem. Unlike Whittingham, who used titanium in his lithium battery, Goodenough used cobalt oxide. This chemical combination resulted in a more stable battery that’s still widely used to this day in all manner of electronics, the iPhone included. In fact, in 2015, the lithium-ion battery market was worth $30 billion, and that number is expected to grow to an incredible $77 billion by 2024. This dramatic projected increase is in large part due to the rising interest in electric cars, evidenced by the opening of Tesla’s Gigafactory, the world’s largest lithium-ion battery plant. Did you know that, in 2007, the so-called “dumb” phones sold by Nokia had a better camera than that of the original iPhone? It’s true and, shockingly enough, the original iPhone camera only had two megapixels, compared to the eight megapixels of the iPhone 6. Even more interesting is that, when Apple began considering incorporating a camera, the company didn’t consider it an essential feature. Today, the camera is almost as essential as the phone itself; it’s also seriously complex. The camera module that goes into an iPhone today has over 200 parts and is considered indispensable. It has a sensor, an image-stabilization module and an image-signal processor that sharpens the image. And that’s just the camera on one side of the phone; there’s also the selfie camera, or FaceTime camera, on the phone’s front. All in all, its technology is so complex that Apple has a separate camera division with some 800 employees, all of whom are working to improve the iPhone camera. So what’s the deal with this selfie camera? Well, while selfies have been around for years (more than a century actually), the iPhone selfie camera played a major role in popularizing this style of photo. Here’s the history behind the selfie: Back in 1839, Robert Cornelius took his own picture. Technically, it wasn’t a photograph but an earlier form of image-making known as a daguerreotype. The camera he used was so slow that it must have taken him at least ten minutes to make his selfie. Then, in 1914, a teenage Russian duchess named Anastasia Nikolaevna took her own photo in a mirror. She later shared the image with her friends and it became one of the first well-known selfies. But the term “selfie” didn’t come into popular usage until the selfie camera was added to the iPhone in 2010. This simple addition made it much easier to take your own photo, and it transformed the culture in the process. Off the top of your head, do you know if it’s going to rain today? How about who invented the light bulb or where the nearest sushi restaurant is? Well, Siri does. In 2015, this artificial intelligence gave out one billion answers a week. In 2016, that number doubled. Because of the computer intelligence and other complex technologies behind Siri, it now assists tons of iPhone users in their daily lives. But how does it work? Siri is parts artificial intelligence, speech-recognition software and language-user interface. Together, they transform human speech into digital language before sending it to an Apple server where another software understands the speech and translates it into written text. From there, the natural-language user interface analyzes it. When she attempts to answer your questions or fulfill your requests, Siri looks to your phone internally. If no solution can be found, she connects to the internet. Let’s take a minute to see how this technology developed. An early inspiration for Siri was Hearsay II, a kind of Siri prototype. This technology was developed by a young Indian researcher at Stanford named Dabbala Rajagopal Reddy. The term “artificial intelligence” had recently been coined by John McCarthy and his colleagues in 1956. They were at Stanford as well and Reddy was drawn in by their research. That context, combined with his interest in language, pushed him toward work in speech recognition. In the 1960s, Reddy and his team designed a system that allowed a computer to understand words. This computer was the largest device of its type at the time, and it understood around 560 words with 92-percent accuracy. Then, during the 1970s, while at Carnegie Mellon University, Reddy continued to work on this system. He eventually turned it into a speech interface called Hearsay, which was proceeded by its successor, Hearsay II. The latter system could understand a thousand English words and it was just a matter of time before the technology was further refined to become what we now know as Siri. Can you name all the different materials in an iPhone? Most people wouldn’t even know where to start. And the list is pretty long, with at least 30 materials, including aluminum, iron, copper and even a bit of tin. That tin most likely comes from the mines of Cerro Rico, right outside the Bolivian city of Potosí. After being mined, the tin is sent to smelters, usually EM Vinto or Operaciones Metalúrgicas, before being shipped to, among other firms, the manufacturers of Apple products. In iPhones, this tin is usually used in the form of solder, a tin-based alloy that connects the various components within the device. This tin from Cerro Rico comes with costs. For instance, since mining began there in the mid-sixteenth century, between four and eight million people have died there from starvation, freezing temperatures and cave ins. As a result, Cerro Rico has earned the morbid nickname “The Mountain That Eats Men.” To this day, around 15,000 people work there, several thousand children among them, and fatality rates are still out of control. In fact, in a recent incident, two kids died while working in a mine. To cope with the brutal conditions of their work, they had gotten drunk and lost their way in the labyrinthine mine, eventually freezing to death. To make matters more frightening, geologists are now warning that the mountain is on the verge of collapse because of centuries of hollowing it out. So mining the tin for the iPhone causes tremendous human suffering, but that’s not the only negative impact of this product. More than half of the tin smelters used by Apple reside on Bangka Island in Indonesia, another site of deadly mines. On this island, the mining overseers randomly, and often illegally, dig pits with tractors, leaving behind unstable walls. These precarious walls often crash down, killing miners in the process. As a result, in 2014, every week a miner died there. In China, just outside of Shenzhen, there sits a massive Foxconn factory that manufactures and assembles the iPhone. Foxconn is the largest employer in mainland China; it employs some 1.3 million people globally, a number only topped by McDonald’s and Walmart. The company’s Longhua plant in Shenzhen is roughly 1.4 square miles in size and at one point it housed some 450,000 workers. Today, while fewer people work in the plant, it’s still one of the largest in the world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the working conditions in this factory are abhorrent. In 2010 alone, 14 workers took their own lives by jumping off the tall factory buildings; another four workers attempted to do the same, but didn’t succeed; and another 20 were stopped by officials before they could try. Each suicide attempt is known to have been motivated by the insufferable conditions of the work, which includes long hours, repressive managers and a common system of unjustified and humiliating fines for even the simplest mistakes. The response of Foxconn CEO, Terry Gou? Rather than improve working conditions, Gou had nets erected around the building to block the free fall of workers. Meanwhile, Steve Jobs was entirely dismissive, citing statistics about comparable suicide rates at your average university. In other words, neither Apple nor its contractors seem to care about worker safety – but they do care about the security of their facilities. In fact, when the author visited the Apple suppliers in Shanghai, he found them highly secured. He wasn’t allowed inside the facility and was even prohibited from taking pictures of it from the outside. There were large numbers of guards and cameras, and it was entirely surrounded by barbed wire. Pegatron, one of the major Shanghai-based suppliers of Apple parts, even makes workers swipe cards and look into cameras that use facial-recognition software before they can enter buildings. While the company claims that such measures are to protect intellectual property, it’s clear that this high security also insulates the company from the bad press that the factory working conditions would doubtless generate. The key message in this book: While the iPhone may embody the pinnacle of modern technology, it’s actually based on centuries of experimentation and innovation. Though this technological wonder has revolutionized modern life, its production has a number of negative effects on the people who assemble the iPhone as well as the workers who mine the metals from which it’s made.

Osborne made a very sobering prediction: by 2033, up to 47 percent of current jobs could be eliminated from the US economy. The reason? In a word, automation – the process by which jobs are performed, well, automatically, without the need for human labor, thanks to robots, software or other forms of technology. According to the study, jobs as wide-ranging as sports refereeing, telemarketing, bank loan supervising, insurance underwriting, retail sales and even catering have a 95 percent or greater chance of obsolescence. The list goes on and on, touching nearly every industry. Meanwhile, just about every remaining job will be significantly affected by automation, and a whole range of new jobs will be created. Some major economic and societal transformations lie ahead. To give you a better idea of what they might look like, these blinks will take a look at developing trends in nine major industries that run the gamut of the modern global economy: manufacturing, transportation, the service sector, law, banking, healthcare, journalism, education and entertainment. In this blinks, you’ll learn about the jobs most likely to get eliminated; the jobs most likely to survive; and the jobs most likely to be radically transformed. In the 1960s, we saw the rise of industrial robots – automated factory machines that manufacture products without human assistance. But six decades later, the robots haven’t taken over yet. There are still millions of people working in factories. Sure, many of those factories are now in Eastern countries like China, rather than Western countries like the United States. But they’re still around, chugging away – and still powered by human sweat. So it would be reasonable to think that maybe the fears about robots taking over were overblown. Well, think again. Even in the East, industrial robots are on the rise, and factory jobs are starting to disappear. In China alone, there were 189,000 industrial robots in 2014. That number is projected to reach 726,000 in 2019. Indeed, far from being the last bastion of manual factory work, China is now pioneering fully automated factories. In 2017, a cellphone factory in the industrial city of Dongguan replaced 590 of its 650 workers with robots. It then announced its ambition to further reduce its staff to 20 and eventually to zero. The Chinese media hailed the factory as a success story, illustrating the progress of the country’s Made in China 2025 economic plan. One of the aims of that plan is to achieve a “robotic revolution,” in the words of President Xi Jinping. Four factors are helping to fuel that revolution. First, industrial robots are becoming cheaper. Second, Chinese labor is getting more expensive. Third, modern industrial robots’ productivity leaves humans in the dust: the robots can work at higher speeds and with greater precision, 365 days per year, 24 hours per day. The fourth and final factor combines the previous ones with the fact that Chinese factories often make products for Western corporations. Given the lower cost of industrial robots, the higher cost of Chinese labor and the tremendous productivity benefits of automation, those same corporations are now tempted to build their own factories at home in the West. That way, they can eliminate their international shipping costs. Put those four factors together, and Chinese factories have a strong economic motivation to automate their operations. That way, they can lower their prices and keep their corporate clients happy. But numerous factory jobs will probably be lost as a result. Indeed, the World Bank estimates that 77 percent of jobs in China are threatened by automation, many of them in manufacturing. And that’s just the tip of the automatic iceberg. Imagine it’s the near future. You’re a corporation with an army of industrial robots cranking out your products around the clock, eliminating most of your manufacturing labor costs in the process. But you still have one pesky little problem: getting those products into the hands of your customers. Well, that’s where the robots come in again. The transportation industry is about to be revolutionized by autonomous vehicles. You’ve probably heard about the self-driving cars being test driven on the highways of California – but autonomous trucks are also in the works, with lots of money being poured into their development. Otto is one of the companies leading the way, and it was recently bought by Uber for $700 million. By 2025, one-third of all American trucks could be automated. At first, they’ll only be allowed to pilot themselves on highways, but eventually, drivers won’t be needed to navigate trickier local roads either. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States, so that’s going to put a whole lot of people out of work. Around the same time, Uber, Lyft and traditional taxi drivers will start joining the ranks of the unemployed. Here, too, Uber has been leading the charge. In 2014, the company hired almost the entire robotics department from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, where it’s been testing a fleet of self-driving taxis since 2016. Around the same time, Lyft got in on the action, too, with a $500 million investment in autonomous vehicle technology. Delivery drivers are also under threat. Domino’s Pizza is already trialing self-driving food delivery cars, and package delivery drones are being developed by Amazon, FedEx, UPS and DHL. Oh, and speaking of drones, there are automated flying taxis already being built by the Chinese company Ehang, and several of them are already in limited operation in Dubai. The future of automated transportation is coming fast, and it’s being driven by rapidly advancing technology. For example, the sensors in self-driving cars are getting increasingly sophisticated, enabling them to be responsive to unexpected events, like a dog running across a foggy road at night. As a result, from 2015 to 2016, the rate at which human engineers needed to override autonomous vehicles on test drives fell from 0.5 percent to 0.2 percent. Soon, that rate will probably reach zero, at which point, the technology will have fully arrived – probably by the mid-2020s. Unless you’ve been living off-grid for the past decade, you’ve probably made a number of purchases from online retailers, such as Amazon. Of course, millions of other people have been doing the same thing. As a result, brick-and-mortar stores have been dropping like flies. In the United States, just in the first few months of 2017, Radio Shack closed 552 stores; JCPenney, 138; Macy’s, 68 – and the list goes on and on. With each closure, many people also lose their retail jobs. For example, when Macy’s shut down those 68 stores, it also fired 10,100 workers. All in all, about 12 million retail jobs in the United States are currently threatened by the rise of Amazon. And those retail jobs aren’t going to be replaced with Amazon jobs. That’s because the company needs far fewer low-level employees than its brick-and-mortar competitors. Whereas the latter need salespeople, cashiers, security guards and various other employees, Amazon mostly just needs workers to pick up its products from its warehouse shelves and put them onto trucks. And it’s already working on replacing those workers with robots. Now add automated Amazon delivery drones into the mix, quickly bringing the company’s cheap products right to your front door. That’s going to make it even tougher for retail stores to compete with the online giant. As for the stores that survive the e-commerce onslaught, they will be transformed by automation as well. Already, many grocery stores have replaced cashiers with self-checkout systems, and companies are now eyeing other jobs as well. For example, the home improvement company Lowe’s has developed LoweBots: five-foot-tall robots that are equipped with touch screens, speech-recognition technology and wheels that allow it to roll around autonomously. They’re already in operation at some of the company’s stores, where they track inventory and help customers find items. Meanwhile, automation is rapidly taking hold of the other main branch of the service sector: the restaurant industry. Touch-screen ordering tablets are already replacing counter staff and waiters at restaurants like McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. Meanwhile, back in the kitchen, food preparation robots have already debuted at the Zume Pizza chain, which has cut its labor costs in half. Of course, cutting labor costs is a euphemism for getting rid of workers. In the US fast-food industry alone, 3.6 million jobs could be eliminated in the coming years. Factory, retail, restaurant and transportation workers – these are all low jobs on the socio-economic ladder. High-end jobs will be safe from the threat of automation, right? Well, some might be safer, but many of them will also be in peril. Others will be significantly transformed. As a general rule of thumb, the more routinized a job is, the more likely it is to be automated. In other words, the more your job involves doing repetitive actions, the more likely a robot or a computer is to start doing it for you in the coming years. That’s why many lower-end jobs are going to be eliminated; a machine can flip burgers just as well as a human. But the same holds true for many higher-end jobs. Consider the legal profession. Many of the tasks currently performed by lawyers, paralegals and legal secretaries are pretty formulaic. Whether they’re preparing real estate contracts, rental agreements, divorce settlements or wills, these tasks usually involve taking a boilerplate legal document, slightly adapting it to the needs of the client and filling in the blanks with the correct information. With the help of algorithmic software, online legal platforms like RocketLawyer, LegalZoom and LawDepot can do this work automatically by just asking clients a few simple questions. More sophisticated tasks are also beginning to be automated. In 2016, BakerHostetler, one of the largest law firms in the United States, “hired” a robotic lawyer named Ross. Powered by IBM’s Watson supercomputer, Ross can sift through thousands of legal documents in hundreds of databases and make independent decisions about which ones would be most useful to winning a particular case. As a result of automation, 31,000 law-related jobs have been lost in the United Kingdom alone, and another 114,000 will probably disappear in the next two decades. Meanwhile, in the United States, two out of three lawyers could either lose their jobs or see them radically changed in the next 15 years. For example, instead of writing legal documents themselves, human lawyers will just be proofreading and editing documents written by robots like Ross. This is all troubling news if you’re working in the legal profession – but there’s a bright side if you’re a consumer. In the past, only affluent people could afford legal services, such as writing prenuptial agreements. Automation will lower the costs of these services, making them accessible to lower-income people. Nowadays, when you need to do your banking, it’s possible to go for years without ever having to visit a physical branch of your bank. You can update your information and carry out transfers online, and you can deposit and withdraw money from an ATM. Now, remember the meaning of the acronym ATM: Automated Teller Machine. The tasks that are performed by an ATM used to be the exclusive job of human tellers. Those tellers still exist, of course, but in lower numbers today than in yesteryear, thanks to ATMs. In other words, automation has already been present in the commercial banking industry for quite some time, and it’s going to continue gaining steam in the years ahead. To understand why, it’s helpful to recall the reasons that banks exist in the first place. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but one of their essential jobs is to handle money. Now, modern societies are increasingly becoming “cashless” as more and more financial transactions are conducted electronically through credit cards and the like. As the modern economy moves away from physical money (cash), it also moves away from needing physical places to deal with that money (bank branches). Many companies in the banking industry are taking note of this fact and ditching physical banks altogether. The result: entirely virtual banks, such as Schwab.com and Robinhood.com, which are largely run by automated computing systems powered by sophisticated algorithms. You don’t need to be a number-crunching banker to figure out that fewer bank branches equal fewer banking jobs. Indeed, in the developed world, up to 50 percent of all bank branches and their employees could be gone within the next decade. Meanwhile, large investment banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are also becoming automated. They’re putting their services online and replacing their human financial analysts with algorithms. Indeed, JPMorgan Chase has become so invested in this objective that as of 2015, it employs more software engineers and programmers than either Facebook or Twitter – 9,000 out of its 33,000 total employees! The banks’ algorithms are extremely powerful. In just seconds, they can make financial calculations and projections that used to take human analysts hundreds of hours. Within the next decade, they could replace between one-third and one-half of all workers in the financial sector. Have you ever felt sick and Googled your symptoms? Then, like millions of people, you’ve already experienced one of the ways in which automation will transform the future of healthcare. Before online search engines and virtual assistants like Alexa, you probably would have seen your doctor about your symptoms. Now you can find information about their causes and remedies by simply typing a few words into your search bar or saying, “hey, Alexa, how do I perform CPR?” Alexa will already give you precise instructions on how to do things like that, and in the coming years, virtual assistants will become even more sophisticated – capable of answering just about any question you’d ask your family doctor. Meanwhile, we’ll be able to continuously monitor, analyze and improve our health with a variety of sensors and apps built into our smartwatches, cellphones, rings and clothing, along with microchips implanted in our skin. All of these technologies have already been developed to one degree or another. You can monitor your heart rate with a Fitbit, use a cellphone app to diagnose whether a suspicious skin spot is cancerous or not and even wear a posture-improving device that will give you a little electric shock every time you slouch. These are just a taste of things to come. In the near future, as these technologies evolve and proliferate, we’ll be able to track automatically nearly every aspect of our health and self-diagnose nearly every common ailment. And for diagnosing more serious diseases, many hospitals are already using supercomputers like IBM’s Watson. As for medical treatments, once again, the robots are coming – or rather, they’re already here. The Israeli company Mazor Robotics has developed an automated robotic surgeon that’s conducted 25,000 spinal surgeries in the United States. Meanwhile, an American company called Microbot Medical is developing nano-bots. These robots are so tiny that they can swim through the narrow tunnels of your urethra, blood vessels and even the vascular tubes in your brain, cleaning them up and repairing damage as they go. For example, they could remove the plaque from your coronary arteries, which would reduce your risk of having a heart attack. As we’ll see in the next blink, developments like these will radically transform the healthcare industry. With so many innovative medical technologies already here and even more on the horizon, healthcare is going to be just as revolutionized by automation as the other industries we’ve looked at. Up to 80 percent of the work currently done by human doctors could soon be performed by automated systems. But that doesn’t mean that 80 percent of doctors are about to be put out of work. As with the legal profession, it just means that more routine tasks – like doing check-ups and conducting tests – are going to be automated. That will free up doctors to do other, more interesting work. A lot of it will involve playing a support role – essentially acting as a human mediator between patients and the various automated systems that will diagnose their ailments. Let’s say one of those systems detects that you’re genetically predisposed to a certain disease, like Alzheimer’s or diabetes. With that knowledge, you’ll probably want to know how the disease will impact your health. How alarmed should you be about your chances of developing it? With such questions, you’ll want a human doctor to explain things in language that’s easy to understand. In other words, doctors will still have jobs to do: counseling patients and helping them understand the diagnoses delivered by automated systems. Similar robot-support roles will exist in other industries as well. For example, technicians will still be needed to check and repair the sensors of the industrial robots that operate the automated factories of the future. Mechanics will still be needed to fix self-driving vehicles. Human financial advisors will still be needed to answer the more unique questions that people might have about their banking services. And flesh-and-blood lawyers will probably still be desired by higher-income clients, who want (and can afford) more of a “human touch.” Other industries won’t be so lucky, however. For example, remember those touch-screen ordering devices that are showing up in fast-food restaurants? Well, one of the main motivations behind their implementation isn’t just to cut labor costs. It turns out that given a choice between ordering from one of the devices or talking to a person behind the counter, most customers (especially younger ones) prefer the devices. They don’t want a human touch! But in other industries, that touch will be indispensable, and these will be the industries in which the jobs of the future may flourish, as we’ll see in the next blink. As technology automates the more tedious routine tasks that people have to do in their current jobs, it will also free them up to do more interesting work in other fields besides healthcare. One of them is journalism. Artificial intelligence, or AI, programs are already writing news stories – but they tend to be the type of stories that are rather boring for journalists to write. A vivid example of this comes from The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and leading the charge toward automating certain aspects of journalism. In the 2016 US elections, the newspaper used an AI program called Heliograf to cover about 500 local races. How did it work? Well, Heliograf just took a local election story template written by some human journalists and then filled in the blanks with data that a human editor fed to it. For example, if a Democratic candidate won a certain congressional race, Heliograf would automatically insert certain paragraphs into the story template: a paragraph about the candidate's biography, or on how her victory would affect the balance of power in Congress. That might not sound very exciting – and that’s precisely the point. Programs like Heliograf will enable media companies to hand off more mundane journalism to the computers and let journalists concentrate on the more interesting aspects of their profession. There are long-form stories to chase, in-depth interviews to conduct and analytical articles to be written. Those are tasks that AI is far away from being able to accomplish, so humans will still be needed to do them for the foreseeable future. Finally, AI systems will soon start augmenting journalists’ investigative powers. For example, remember the Panama Papers of 2015? It was the largest data leak in history, consisting of 11.5 million documents that detailed the dodgy financial transactions of the world’s richest companies and individuals. That’s far too many documents for journalists to sift through, so the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) created a database with a search engine that enabled them to find the proverbial needles in the haystack. For example, they could type in a particular person’s name and find all of his of her transactions. Now the ICIJ is working on an AI-powered system that would enable them to trace connections between individuals and organizations. The system is expected to be operational sometime in 2019. If there’s one thing you’ve learned from these blinks so far, it’s that automation is going to shake up many industries in the years ahead. Some new jobs will be created, but many others will be eliminated, and the old jobs that survive will be radically transformed. With so much change going on in the economy, people will have to learn how to adapt – updating their skills for their evolving jobs or retraining for brand new careers or even industries, such as virtual reality programming (more on that in the next blink). And that means education is going to be more important than ever before. But education itself is going to be reshaped by automation as well. Yes, we’re talking about robot teachers. There’s already one on the market: Professor Einstein – a small, humanoid robot that bears a striking resemblance to the famous physicist after which it’s named. What does it do? Well, if you ask him, Professor Einstein will tell you in his own words: “I can walk, talk, teach games, forecast weather, and answer all questions about science.” Unfortunately, he can also lose his Wi-Fi connection, which caused him to malfunction when he was on television being interviewed by the author, much to the embarrassment of his creators. So teachers don’t need to worry about losing their jobs anytime soon. But as robots like Professor Einstein improve, they will take over some of the main functions that teachers currently play in the education of students. What are those functions? Well, think about what your teachers did for you when you were in school (the good teachers, at least). If you had a question, they tried their best to answer it. If you didn’t understand their initial answers, they’d try to reframe them – putting the information into a form you could grasp, whether by way of a clever analogy or a nifty diagram. Well, imagine if Professor Einstein could do the same – only, unlike his human counterparts, he’d be available 24/7, and he’d never get tired of answering questions or coming up with new explanations. This would allow human teachers to move away from their current focus on transmitting knowledge and concentrate more on cultivating so-called “softer skills,” such as curiosity, initiative, persistence, cooperativeness, flexibility, empathy and ethical behavior. How could teachers do those things? Well, we’ll see one powerful way in the next and final blink. Imagine you’re a present-day teacher and your students want to learn about astronomy. Well, you could talk to them about it, give them books, show them videos, provide them with a telescope or send them to Google, where they can probably learn much more about the subject than you know, thanks to Google’s search algorithms (another reason why your role as a knowledge-transmitter is already waning). But imagine if you could blast off into outer space and take them on a cosmic field trip to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. Well, you can’t do that for the foreseeable future, but soon you’ll be able to do the next best thing thanks to virtual reality, or VR. The technology is evolving rapidly, and a ton of investment money is pouring into the burgeoning industry. Google already has a VR device on the market, and Facebook bought the Oculus VR headset company for $2 billion in 2014. Investors are salivating at the economic prospects of VR. In a study by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, the financial giants declared that the VR headset would become “the one device to disrupt and rule the world of technology.” Immersive VR video games are on the horizon – and just in time, because, as you know by now, many people will be out of work, and they’ll need something to do. Here’s one possible future: millions of people will be unemployed and supported by a universal basic income. Meanwhile, the people who still have jobs will work much fewer hours, thanks to automation. What will people do with all their newfound free time? They’ll probably spend most of it consuming various forms of entertainment and culture, such as music, television, video games, movies and books. That’s good news for musical artists, filmmakers, writers and other creatives who work in the entertainment and culture industries. Already, those industries employ 29.5 million people around the world – more than the total workers in the United States, Europe and Japanese automotive industries combined! The more people have free time, the more they’ll demand entertainment and culture – and the more the economy will need actors, directors, musicians, producers and so forth to keep people entertained and edified. Thus, though manual labor will largely become a thing of the past, entertainment and culture may well flourish! The key message in these blinks Over the next few decades, automation will likely replace many current workers in manufacturing, transportation, banking, law and the service sector. Along the way, it will create some new jobs that will center around supporting the robots and other automated systems that replaced those workers. Automation will also eliminate some positions and job functions in medicine, journalism and education, but it will also allow workers in those fields to do more interesting work. Finally, automation will expand people’s free time, which will increase the demand for artists and entertainers.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

After all, your smartphone or laptop is interacting with millions of others across the globe, and it has access to well over a billion interconnected web pages. Complex systems such as the internet have undoubtedly made our lives easier, and, as technology improves, they’ll increasingly improve our existence. But we need to be careful. If we want to make the most of complex networks, society must keep up with technological change. At the moment, it’s far too easy for people to use networks against us: terrorists can use the internet to spread their message, criminals can hack into our data and speculators can use the increasingly complex financial system to crash the economy. Only by constantly keeping our institutions and infrastructure up-to-date can we hope to prevent this disruption. These blinks explain how we as individuals and as a society can survive and thrive in this complex age. In these blinks, you’ll learn why we need a seventh sense; why you shouldn’t consult Doctor ELIZA; and why gatekeepers can make your life hell. Back in the nineteenth century when the industrial revolution was in full swing, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche shrewdly said that people needed a “sixth sense.” In other words, he meant that, as a society, humans would need to develop another instinct in order to keep up with the pace of technological change. Today, it’s necessary for people to develop a Seventh Sense to comprehend the complex connections of networks which have formed between people, mobile devices, computers and financial markets as a result of technological advancement. To develop a Seventh Sense, you first have to understand that everything is interconnected. Take the unveiling of the first iPod in 2001. The device not only fundamentally changed the way people listen to music; it altered the music industry itself. After the product was launched, people stopped using Discmans, and CD shops began to close while MP3 sales flourished. Eventually, this led to the rise of streaming services such as Spotify. In essence, the old analog network was replaced by a new digital network. As technology moves rapidly, old network systems are frequently replaced by new ones – the author refers to this process as network power. To understand network power, look at the way that English is presently used as a global lingua franca. The language enables information to be shared in a simple manner among people from different countries across the world, making it a powerful network of exchange. Currently, switching languages seems inconceivable. However, eventually, lingua francas like English will be replaced with real-time machine translation between many languages because that is the nature of network power. Advanced connectivity has allowed this technology to develop. One day, you’ll be able to jump into a taxi in Madrid and say “good morning,” and your taxi driver will instantly hear “buenos días.” There will come a time when a translation algorithm will be more vital than having the ability to speak and comprehend English. Rewind to the dawn of the internet age. If you were told back then that the development of the web would eventually lead to Syrian terrorists finding an easy means to indoctrinate children, would you have supported such innovations? The influence that networks currently have on society is more far-reaching than anyone could have anticipated. Institutions are struggling to keep up with the progression of these networks, as is evidenced by the way terror attacks are handled. After 9/11, the war against terrorism was launched. A Pentagon analysis team surveyed records of terrorists’ deleted phone calls and SMS and discovered that terrorist networks were developing at a much faster rate than the government or military were able to monitor. In 2003, US troops learned that a terrorist in Baghdad had managed to conceive a way to make a bomb that was able to penetrate American tanks. A mere ten days later, an identical bomb killed a US official in rural Afghanistan. Although the troops planned to update their tank defense, they were too slow compared to their enemy’s fast-paced mode of attack. The terrorists’ network of communication was simply more advanced. Even newly recruited, barely educated terrorists on the internet manage to elude the government’s old-fashioned, slow systems. The Pentagon’s task force, known as the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), found that terrorists tended to visit sites containing instructions on how to make bombs. Other terrorists would also provide real-time advice in encrypted chat rooms to which the American government was unable to gain access. To combat their activity, JIEDDO installed devices to monitor the streets. Although this plan worked to prevent individual attacks, it did nothing to address the heart of the problem. Historically, emperors, presidents, kings, queens and authority figures like doctors or lawyers have presided over power and influence in predetermined hierarchical structures. However, in current times, world leaders and other experts are in a constant battle to maintain their power thanks to challenges from modern networks. Networks are characterized by two different forms of power: high concentration and large distribution. Doctors are one group under threat from powerful networks. Doctors were once considered to be the main source of medical knowledge, but that no longer seems to be the case. Instead of booking an appointment to see a doctor, nowadays people tend to google the symptoms of their illness. Various medical websites are easily accessible, and people can join communities where they can discuss their affliction with those who suffer from similar diseases – this is a large distribution setup. Due to the high number of people who use the search engine and the amount of information being shared, Google can be defined as a highly concentrated network. Google is therefore both a source of large distribution and high concentration – this means that, ultimately, the medical sites accessed through Google harbor more power than a cardiologist like the author’s father, even though he has years of experience as a doctor. To better understand networks, it’s important to be able to distinguish between complicated and complex systems. Jet engines and calculators consist of several interacting components, but are designed to complete only a limited set of unchanging tasks; they are therefore complicated systems. On the contrary, complex systems like the World Wide Web are ever-changing and harder to control. Noting the difference between the two is essential. The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, learned this the hard way. He confessed that the failure of European officials to treat the financial market as a complex system led to the 2008 financial crisis. The traditional models and tools which were available at the time were not enough to sustain such a complex structure. If Trichet and his team had identified the financial market as a complex system, then they would’ve been better equipped to approach problems effectively. The networking age has offered up a range of possibilities, but it’s important to remember that each innovation comes with a unique set of flaws and unforeseeable consequences. As the French philosopher Paul Virilio once said: “When you invent the plane, you invent the plane crash.” Take cyber attacks, a major issue today. Back in 2015, Jung Hoon Lee, a South Korean hacker, was awarded $225,000 at an annual hacking competition for accessing the most vital networking programs at the time by infiltrating web browsers such as Apple’s Safari and Google Chrome. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars hiring the best programmers in the world, yet Jung Hoon Lee was able to overtake their security in less than a minute. Hackers like Jung Hoon Lee prove that there’s a negative side to our new internet-led world. Complex networks inevitably invite dangerous repercussions; more advanced security systems simply lead to more advanced methods of attack. Generally, people tend to be too trusting of networks where caution is needed. Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at MIT, coded two programs called DOCTOR and ELIZA – both of which would be able to respond to basic questions posed by humans. When conceiving ELIZA, Weizenbaum made use of the psychotherapist Carl Rogers’ conversational technique of responding to a question with an open-ended question such as “Can you think of a specific example?” Due to this method, ELIZA proved highly popular. As a result, Weizenbaum received numerous letters from renowned psychologists claiming that ELIZA could potentially replace the need for counseling. Weizenbaum wasn’t excited by this prospect; he became frightened by the power his program had generated, as people readily trusted it with personal information. However, he eventually concluded that ELIZA wouldn’t replace the need for counseling anytime soon. It was only a computer program after all. Increased connectivity means that, as a society, we are not only vulnerable to constant monitoring and control by institutions, but by anyone who can bypass existing forms of virtual security. A closed network such as a Wi-Fi network is referred to as a gateland. Gatekeepers have to grant access. Gatekeepers are people or protocols with the power to decide who’s allowed to gain access to a particular closed network. In the case of your work Wi-Fi, the encrypted Wi-Fi password is the gatekeeper – only those who know it are permitted to have a speedy connection to the internet on a secure network. The higher the number of people who use a certain gateland, the harder it becomes to utilize an alternative. The economist Brian Arthur discussed this concept in the Harvard Business Review, referring to the impact of a phenomenon known as “network effects.” Say you’re new to the internet and ten of your friends start using Facebook. It’ll be harder to branch out and use an alternative social network instead because your friends won’t be there. The more users there are in a network, the greater the number of connections there can be. This explains why Windows runs on 90 percent of PCs worldwide and Android runs on 81 percent of smartphones. Being excluded from a network by a gatekeeper can also have detrimental effects. Bob Metcalfe, an electrical engineer, designed a connection protocol called Ethernet which would eventually become the main way to connect computers together. The term “Metcalfe’s law” emerged from his protocol; it states that the value of a network increases as the number of people who utilize the network grows. At Stanford University, the number of computers connected to the Ethernet network increased rapidly. Peers frequently used the Ethernet to easily share notes over email. In this instance, imagine that you’re a student denied access to the Ethernet. You would instantly be at a disadvantage as you wouldn’t have access to the same information as your fellow students. Imagine a graver situation. If there were a database of cancer genetics with information from a million users to which you weren’t granted access, this exclusion could prove fatal. You wouldn’t be able to comparatively analyze your genes with others to identify any patterns which may require medical attention. One day, the process of withdrawing bank notes from an ATM and giving it to another person who ends up depositing that same cash into their own account will be an outdated system replaced with fully digitized payments. This may sound promising, but there are several risks involved in a new, interconnected world of digital currencies. Those who seek to maintain anonymity and be untraceable could pose serious problems, but fortunately, there are solutions in place. Hard gatekeeping serves to protect those inside a network’s community. Hard gatekeeping is the development of a protected, trusted and well-designed community that safeguards its users from both the perils of online trade and cyber threats. Eventually, digital currencies such as Bitcoin are bound to replace physical money. Mobile phones and virtual banks have already begun to outline the future of currency. The Bitcoin protocol acts as a gatekeeper as it protects its users from being identified, but this has resulted in many drug dealers and tax evaders utilizing the network. Cybercriminals are able to easily gain access to the Dark Web where users’ identities are hidden and Bitcoin is the main form of currency. To bypass these issues, a new gateland will be conceived involving a reliable form of digital currency that’s trackable, and the government will serve as a hard gatekeeper keeping everything in check. Currently, billions of dollars worth of foreign aid are mishandled and eventually end up in the wrong hands. When digital currency is monitored correctly, however, teachers, nurses and students will receive their donations in full. Digital currency itself will become a gateland where the network protects all users regardless of socioeconomic status. Increased connectivity can bring positive outcomes, but there are downsides. Gatelands can, of course, help protect against cyber attacks, but, just now, interconnectivity is not without problems. The key message in this book: Networks can offer endless opportunities, but the more connected society becomes, the more susceptible people are to various attacks by those who have the power to bypass online security. Therefore, it’s important to be cautious when operating online.  Actionable advice: Read the terms and conditions of a site thoroughly.

Even worse, experts tend to be fairly confident about the quality of their predictions despite historical data showing the opposite.

Among other things, you’ll find out why you could’ve made some outstanding profits based on who won the Super Bowl each year for three decades, why a positive mammogram result can still only mean a 10 percent chance of having breast cancer and why it’s natural that stock traders don’t care if a bubble forms in the market. Will you walk to work today or take the bus? Will you take an umbrella or not? In our everyday lives, we make decisions based on predictions of what will happen in the future, like whether it will rain or shine. But predictions are also common in the public realm: stock market analysts, meteorologists and sports commentators all make a living out of them. One area where one might expect particularly good predictions is the economy. After all, it’s of crucial importance for individuals, companies and even nations, and there’s a wealth of data available: some companies track as many as four million economic indicators. But despite these factors, economists have an atrocious track record in forecasting. Consider the commonly predicted economic indicator, the gross domestic product (GDP). The first problem with GDP predictions is that economists often make predictions like “Next year, GDP will increase by 2.7 percent.” In fact, they’ve derived this figure from a broad prediction interval that says something like “It is 90 percent likely that GDP growth will fall somewhere between 1.3 and 4.2 percent.” So an exact number as a prediction is misleading, as it gives a false sense of precision and security. What’s worse, economists aren’t actually very good at coming up with prediction intervals either. If their 90 percent prediction intervals were roughly accurate, one would expect the actual GDP to only fall outside the prediction interval one out of ten times. However, a poll of professional forecasters shows that, since 1968, they’ve been wrong roughly half the time. Therefore, it seems that economists’ are not only poor predictors but also gravely overestimate their predictions’ certainty. Besides GDP predictions, economists are also spectacularly bad at forecasting depressions. Consider that, in the 1990s, economists were only able to predict two out of the sixty depressions that had occurred worldwide one year ahead of time. To put it kindly, economic predictions should be taken with at least a grain of salt. Why is predicting the economy so hard? Quite simply, because a staggering amount of interwoven factors can influence it: a tsunami striking Taiwan can affect whether someone gets a job in Oklahoma. What’s more, figuring out the causal relationship between different economic factors can be a headache. For example, unemployment rates are generally considered to be affected by the underlying health of the economy because businesses tend to hire more in healthy economic climates. But unemployment rates also influence how much money consumers have to spend, which impacts consumer demand and thus the overall health of the economy. The above example illustrates another complicating factor: feedback loops. When businesses have increased sales, it spurs them to hire more workers. This then gives those workers more disposable income, which increases consumption and further boosts sales. There are also external factors that can distort the meaning of many economic indicators. For example, rising house prices are normally a positive indicator, but not if they’re being artificially inflated by government policies. Ironically, even economic predictions themselves can also affect the economy as people and businesses adjust their behavior depending on them. And not only the state of the economy is affected by a myriad of factors: the very basics of forecasting are also constantly in flux. First of all, the global economy is constantly evolving, so even tried-and-true theories go rapidly obsolete. But since it’s impossible to predict when, exactly, this will happen, existing rules of thumb are relied upon until found to be broken. Second, the data sources that economists work with to understand the past and present are very unreliable, and subject to constant revision. For example, US government data on the last quarter of 2008 indicated a mere 3.8 percent decline in GDP, but the data was later revised and indicated a near 9 percent decline. No wonder accurate predictions are hard to come by. As stated in the previous blink, the economy is such a complex web of interrelated factors that causality is hard to define. This has lead many economists to try a purely statistical approach: instead of trying to understand what causes have which effects, they just look at huge swathes of data hoping to spot patterns. Unfortunately, this approach is fraught with potential for errors because it is inevitable that some patterns will emerge due to coincidence alone. For example, consider that from 1967 to 1997, the winner of the Super Bowl seemed strongly correlated to economic development: in twenty-eight of those thirty years, a winner from the National Football League meant stock market gains for the rest of the year, whereas a winner originally from the American Football League predicted stock market losses. Statistics indicate that the likelihood of this relationship being a coincidence is one in 4,700,000. Clearly, economists should start watching more football, right? Wrong. In fact this correlation is due to chance alone, and since 1998, the trend has actually been reversed. With over four million economic indicators being tracked, it is clear that some coincidental correlations like this one will arise. And relying on them to make predictions will eventually backfire, for the coincidence will come to an end some day. It is therefore crucial that, even if we use technology to wade through huge masses of data, there is still a human there to do the analysis and consider whether there is plausible causality. But many people don’t realize this. Instead, they try to get more and more information and economic variables to draw predictions from, believing that it will make predictions more accurate when, in fact, all it does is increase the amount of useless information – or noise – which in turn makes it harder to spot useful information – or the signal – hidden within. Let’s turn our gaze now to four forecasting failures in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, starting with those related to the housing bubble. The first was the overly optimistic belief of homeowners, lenders, brokers and rating agencies that the meteoric rise of US house prices would continue indefinitely. They held this belief despite the fact that, historically, a meteoric rise in housing prices combined with record-low savings had always led to a crash. So how could everyone have missed that? One contributing factor was probably that everybody was making too much money in the booming market to begin questioning whether a recession might be around the corner. The second failure was committed by rating agencies regarding the riskiness of financial instruments called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which consisted of a bundle of mortgage debts. The idea was that, as homeowners made payments on their mortgages, investors who held CDOs would earn profits. Since CDOs were a completely new kind of financial instrument, agencies had to rely solely on statistical models based on the risk of individual mortgages defaulting. Unfortunately, this neglected the possibility of a large-scale housing crash which could bring down prices across the board. The result was, of course, disastrous. The rating agency Standard & Poor’s had claimed, for example, that the CDOs it gave an AAA-rating only had a 0.12 percent chance of defaulting but, in fact, some 28 percent of them wound up defaulting. Continuing from the previous blink, let’s examine the two other forecasting failures that contributed to the financial crisis that started in 2008. The third predictive failure happened at American financial institutions, which were so eager to chase after profits in the booming market that they leveraged themselves excessively with debt to make more investments. Take the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which had leveraged itself so that it only had $1 of its own capital for every $33 worth of financial positions it held. In other words, if the value of its portfolio had declined by even 4 percent, it would have faced bankruptcy. Other major US banks also had similarly high levels of leverage. It was as if the industry collectively believed that a recession was impossible. Of course, this leverage was helping them make huge profits at the time, so no one was too interested in seriously considering the likelihood of a recession. The fourth failure in prediction was committed by the US government after the recession had struck. As the government’s economic team was crafting the stimulus package in 2009, they thought they were dealing with a regular recession where employment figures would bounce back in one to two years. But history shows that recessions caused by a financial crash usually make unemployment rates stay high for four to six years – and since this recession was caused by such a crash, they should have known better. This made their stimulus package woefully inadequate. In the next blinks, we’ll discover some key ways to overcome these difficulties. As we’ve seen, forecasting is fraught with difficulties. One key way of overcoming them when estimating probabilities is to adopt the so-called Bayesian approach, a theorem based on work by eighteenth century English minister Thomas Bayes. This approach provides a mathematical framework for updating one’s beliefs in a rational way as new information comes in. As an example of how beliefs should be updated, let’s consider this scenario: you’re a woman in your forties worried about breast cancer, so you want to predict how likely you are to have it. To start with, you see that studies indicate that around 1.4 percent of women develop breast cancer in their forties. This is known as the prior probability: the probability you assume before you get any new information. Then you decide to get a mammogram, as that procedure can detect breast cancer. To your horror, the result is positive. What does that mean? Probably less than you think. Mammograms are by no means foolproof. On the one hand, if a woman does have breast cancer, a mammogram will only discover it about 75 percent of the time. On the other, even if a woman doesn’t have breast cancer, a mammogram will still indicate that she does about 10 percent of the time. So knowing this and Bayes’ theorem, how likely is it that you have breast cancer after the positive mammogram? You may be astonished to hear the likelihood is only 10 percent. What’s more, clinical data confirms this. This surprise highlights that we don’t have a very good intuitive understanding of how new information, like the mammogram’s result, interacts with old information. Specifically, we tend to focus too much on what’s new, overemphasizing the mammogram’s result and forgetting that, in fact, the incidence of breast cancer is so low that the false positives far outweigh the correct positives. Using Bayes’ theorem helps us avoid our inherent biases, like our preference for recent information. To understand another key to making better forecasts, let’s take a look at what kind of people make the best predictions. Beginning in 1987, a psychologist and political scientist by the name of Philip Tetlock began recording predictions on topics like politics and the economy made by a wide variety of experts. After analyzing the accuracy of these predictions as well as the personalities and thinking styles of the experts that made them, Tetlock began to see a clear pattern. It turned out that the more successful predictors were likely to use strategies where they tried to integrate many little pieces of knowledge, whereas the less successful ones tended to just hang on to one big idea or fact. He named these two types of people the hedgehogs and the foxes. Hedgehogs are typically brash and confident, claiming that they have discovered big, governing principles that the world adheres to: think Sigmund Freud and the unconscious. Foxes, however, tend to be more cautious and meticulous, contemplating matters from various perspectives and carefully weighing the pros and cons. They are also more likely than hedgehogs to rely on empirical evidence and data, willingly discarding their own ideologies and preconceptions and letting the data speak for itself. Of course, hedgehogs’ confidence has much more media appeal, hence their predictions tend to garner far more attention than the foxes’. But, at the end of the day, it was the foxes who had better predictions. In fact, the hedgehogs’ predictions were overall only little better than ones made at random. So it seems that good predictors are made good by taking into account many different factors and weighing them from as many perspectives, not by relying on simple, big truths. In the following blinks, you’ll discover how to use some of what you’ve learned to make better predictions in notoriously hard-to-predict areas. One notoriously difficult phenomenon to predict is the short-term behavior of the stock market. Sure, in the long run, the average value of stocks tends to increase, but this information is of little use to most traders because they want to “beat the market.” A desire that has proven to be spectacularly difficult to fulfill. For one, it’s hard for one person to predict the behavior of the market well. In fact, one study showed that when seventy economists made stock market forecasts over a multi-year period, their aggregate prediction was always better than any individual’s. This difficulty was also seen in a study of mutual and hedge funds: it found that, just because one fund did well in a particular year, it was no more likely than the others to beat its competition in the following year. Clearly, the success was just a fluke, and no fund was really better at predicting the market than the others. Why is beating the market so difficult? Because the stock market is usually very efficient, i.e., there are no easy, sure-fire wins to be had. Most trades are made by very smart, capable people on behalf of large financial institutions which have huge amounts of data and expertise at their disposal. This means that if a stock is over- or underpriced, the market will correct that very quickly. The only surefire way to beat the market is to know something no-one else does. And the only source for such an advantage tends to be illegal insider information. Interestingly, one group of investors which seem particularly adept at beating the market are members of Congress, whose investments tend to exceed the returns of the overall market by 5 to 10 percent annually. This is especially noteworthy given that they are privy to insider information through lobbyists, and can also impact the business prospects of companies by means of legislation. In the next blink, you’ll see one area where the market is decidedly not efficient. Though the stock market usually tends to be efficient, this is not true when bubbles form, meaning situations where stocks are overvalued. Though there is no foolproof way to predict a bubble, there are some telltale signs. First, there’s the obvious clue: a sharp increase in stock prices in general. In fact, looking at historical cases when the S&P 500 stock market index increased at double its long-term average over five years, in five out of the eight cases it ended in a severe crash. Second, you can keep your eye on the price/earnings, or P/E ratio, of stocks: the market price per share divided by the total annual earnings of the company per share. In the long run, the P/E ratio of the entire market tends to be around 15. This means that if the average P/E ratio in the market is much over that, say 30 – as it had been at the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000 – you have a pretty good indication that a bubble is forming. But why do such bubbles form? Shouldn’t investors spot them and sell, thus bringing the prices back down? Well, actually, if you think about it, they shouldn’t. You see, most institutional investors invest on behalf of their firm and their clients. When they perform well, they get huge bonuses, and when they perform badly, they might be fired. Thus, even when they see a bubble is forming, they keep buying and reaping bonuses as the market soars. When the crash does eventually happen, they’ll only have lost their company’s and their clients money, not their own. What’s more, all their colleagues do the same, so it’s unlikely they’ll be singled out and fired. In fact, after the last three big crashes on Wall Street, only about 20 percent of staff lost their jobs, so there’s an 80 percent chance traders will keep their jobs even if they ignore the bubble. Like the economy, the climate comprises a very complicated, interrelated system which is very difficult to model and make predictions about. Even very sophisticated models that take into account countless factors, like El Nino cycles and sunspots, have failed spectacularly. For example, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) based its 1990 prediction on such a complicated model, stating that, over the next hundred years, global temperatures would increase by between two and five degrees, with three degrees being the most likely result. But observations made over the next eleven years indicated this was completely wrong: the pace was only 1.5 degrees per century, below even the lowest end of their IPCC estimate. Climate scientists themselves are well aware of how difficult modeling is: while almost all of them agree that climate change is occurring due to human activity, they are far more skeptical of the accuracy of their models and the likely effects climate change will have. For example, only 19 percent felt that their models of sea levels rising due to climate change were any good. So it seems that climate models using lots of data are not accurate. But could we find a simpler model, one that pays attention only to the signal, and not the noise of countless variables? It turns out that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is that signal. Simple models from the 1980s that rely only on current and projected levels of CO2 do a far better job of predicting global temperature development than later, more complicated ones. What’s more, this relationship is not a mere statistical fluke because it has plausible a cause and effect. The greenhouse effect is a well-established physical phenomenon: greenhouse gases like CO2 accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat in it. Unfortunately, accurate predictions are only one part of the solution: nations need to take collective action to change the trend. We’ve all heard of conspiracy theories relating to the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. Some claim the attacks were so obviously predictable that the US government must have known about them in advance. For example, in July 2001, there was a warning about heightened Al-Qaeda activity, and in August 2001, an Islamic fundamentalist was arrested due to his suspicious request to be allowed to practice flying on a Boeing 747 simulator. Also, previous terrorist plots of flying commercial jets into buildings had already been discovered. But actually, the meaning of these signals is only obvious in retrospect. At the time, all this was mere noise: security agencies charged with preventing terrorism have to sift through hundreds of thousands of such potential leads, the vast majority of which lead nowhere. Nevertheless, the US government should not have been as surprised by this large-scale attack as it was. Why? Because data indicates that such attacks are actually to be expected: the frequency and severity of terrorist attacks follows a pattern known as Clauset’s curve. Basically, when attacks are grouped together based on how many fatalities they caused and then their frequency is plotted, we see a very predictable double-logarithmic curve where attacks become less frequent the more devastating they are. Clauset’s curve clearly indicates that an attack on the 9/11 scale happens roughly once every eighty years, so the government should have been open to this possibility. The good news is that it seems Clauset’s curve is not set in stone. Israel seems to have found a successful way of negating the upper end of Clauset’s curve by focusing almost all of its efforts on preventing large-scale attacks, while treating smalls-scale attacks as something almost akin to mere crime. The result has been that, since 1979, no attacks have claimed more than 200 people at once. Clearly, there is something to this approach that other nations could learn from. The key message in this book: Experts in many areas tend to make astonishingly poor predictions, yet voice far too much confidence in their accuracy. They all trawl through data looking for correlations but, in a world with rapidly increasing amounts of data, this is bound to result in coincidental patterns that will eventually backfire.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

If you’ve ever read or watched one of them, you may have wondered, “How likely is it that the future will be so bleak?” Well, after reading these blinks, you’ll come away with a rather unsettling answer. That is, very likely – unless we do something about it. In these blinks, we’ll be looking at some of the ways in which digital technology affects politics and economics. By digital technology, we refer to innovations like social media platforms, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data – the collection and analysis of large sets of data. For convenience, we’ll often refer to these innovations as simply “technology,” even though that term usually has a broader meaning. Technology, in this sense, has brought many undeniable benefits to the world. However, as we’ll see in the following blinks, it also poses equally undeniable dangers to the very underpinnings of democracy – threats that could destroy it unless we acknowledge and address them in time. In these blinks, you will learn how encryption and cryptocurrencies pose threats to democratic governments; how AI may destroy the middle class; and how governments and citizens can take steps to head off these and many other dangers facing democracy. What would happen if a democracy held a national election and no one bothered to debate the issues, inform themselves about policy proposals or even vote on the candidates? It would be as if you threw a party and no one showed up: hardly a party – or, in this case, a democracy – at all. Like a party, democracy requires people’s active participation – and the more active the participation, the more robust the result. With democracy, active participation entails sifting through claims, weighing facts and making decisions on who or what is the best candidate or course of action. Active citizenship is the first of the six pillars on which democracy rests. Now, let’s say people show up to your party and are actively participating. So far, so good – but what happens if they start getting rowdy? Well, eventually, the party might turn into a riot. The same goes for democracy. For it to work, citizens must not only actively participate, but actively participate in certain ways – two of which are to engage in rational debate and compromise, which allow them to amicably work through their differences and move forward together. This shared democratic culture is the second pillar. Now, let’s say you throw a party and a couple of loudmouthed attendees dominate all of the conversations, undermining other people’s abilities to participate in the process. That won’t work either – everyone needs to be able to participate more or less equally and freely. The same goes for democracy. For it to work, citizens must stand on more or less equal footing, talk to each other and vote on issues and candidates without interference. These are the third, fourth, and fifth pillars: equality, free association and free elections. Finally, returning to the party analogy one last time, who’s going to look after the gathering to steer people in the right direction – encouraging them to participate actively, amicably, equally and freely? Well, you – the host. Similarly, the government’s job is to ensure that citizens participate in democracy. And to do this job, the government needs power. That’s the sixth pillar: governmental authority. Unfortunately, modern technology poses a threat to all six of these pillars of democracy. In the following blinks, we’ll see how it’s doing that. Then, we’ll look at what might happen if they collapse and how this can be avoided. What are the foundations of active citizenship? An easy way of answering this question is by asking why all democracies have a minimum voting age. Well, the answer is simple: children aren’t mature, independent or wise enough to make political decisions – or so the thinking goes. At the same time, active citizenship depends on citizens being politically mature, independent-minded and capable of making their own judgments. Unfortunately, technology weakens all three attributes of active citizenship. One way it does this is by exposing people to constant public scrutiny on social media. This encourages self-censorship, which discourages political development. For example, on Twitter, many people are afraid to speak their minds because they fear facing angry mobs of respondents, data collection or employer scrutiny – especially since a single stupid thing they say today could come back to haunt them years from now. The safer option? Keep quiet or never say anything controversial – just parrot the acceptable public responses on any given issue. In other words, don’t put yourself in a position to make mistakes in your opinions, be corrected on them, learn from them, change your mind and thereby develop your political thinking. Meanwhile, the increasingly sophisticated data collection techniques and processing algorithms of big data are leading to an increasingly manipulated citizenry. This happens through the development of personalized ad delivery systems, which can target people’s precise interests and even moods. In the near future, for instance, someone could tweet about a bad encounter with a foreigner and get targeted by an anti-immigration ad from a nativist politician. Or she could tweet about recycling and get targeted by an ad from Greenpeace. Fast forward further into the future, and we can also see a more existential threat to active citizenship – artificial intelligence (AI). As it becomes more powerful, AI will be able to make decisions that are increasingly better, wiser and shrewder than ours. As a result, we’ll increasingly doubt our abilities to make our own decisions and defer to AI to make them for us. We already see glimpses of this future to come with apps like iSideWith, which tells you who to vote for based on your preferences. Millions of Brits used the app in the last few elections, effectively outsourcing their judgment to an algorithm. In politics, as in life in general, human beings have a natural tendency to congregate into groups of like-minded individuals. What turns a group into a political tribe is a shared sense of grievances and struggle. There have always been such tribes, but technology significantly facilitates their creation. By making it easier for people to find and create associations with each other, the internet makes it easier for them to cluster into smaller groups with specific grievances, fragmenting the population into more and more tribes. As a result, no matter your background or grievance, you’re likely to find your specific tribe online. If you’re on the far left, you can join Antifa. If you’re of the opposite persuasion, you can link up with the alt-right. And if your tribe doesn’t already exist, you can simply create it. After facilitating the creation of tribes, technology then reinforces them by encouraging their members to consume a diet of information that fans the flames of their shared sense of grievances and struggle. The reason for this boils down to the sheer amount of content available online, which allows people to easily find like-minded sources of information that fuel their sense of oppression. Algorithmic curation then amplifies people’s gravitation to like-minded sources. For example, YouTube provides myriad more options than mass television of the past. Once you start opening videos, the site’s algorithms begin analyzing your preferences, predicting what you’re most likely to watch next and offering suggestions that reflect and reinforce those preferences. As a result, people become increasingly agitated and entrenched in their beliefs, which makes it increasingly difficult for them to communicate and cooperate, leading to political deadlock. Even worse, as tribal divisions deepen and people feel increasingly under attack from other tribes, they also come to view those tribes as enemies, and seek a leader who can protect them and fight their foes. For example, from 1992 to 2014, the number of Americans with very negative views of supporters of the opposing political party more than doubled. Then, in 2016, many Trump supporters flocked to him because they saw him as a leader who would save them from enemy tribes: Mexicans, Muslims, liberals and the mainstream media. Imagine a science fiction scenario in which an evil genius gains mind control over all of the citizens of a democracy. Election day arrives, and – surprise – the evil genius wins in a landslide! Would this election be free and fair? Of course not – and the reason is simple. To participate in free and fair elections, voters must be able to make up their own minds without undue influence. Unfortunately, technology is making this increasingly difficult. While mind control may still be the stuff of science fiction, political parties are gaining an unprecedented ability to influence voters’ decision-making processes by leveraging big data. Using sophisticated techniques to collect and analyze large sets of data from people’s shopping data, web browsing histories and voting records, political parties have been able to gain increasingly perceptive understandings of their potential voters. This, in turn, allows them to target and communicate with sympathetic voters more and more precisely. For example, in 2016, while teaming with the Trump campaign, the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica determined that a preference for US-made automobiles strongly indicated a potential Trump voter. Thus, if someone had recently bought a Ford but hadn’t voted in years, the campaign could tell that he was a promising target. In this manner, Cambridge Analytica was able to help the campaign identify 13.5 million persuadable voters in 16 battleground states – thereby creating a roadmap of where to have rallies, knock on doors and advertise on television. Given the decisiveness of these voters and these states, Cambridge Analytica played a major role in electing Trump. If that seems like a worrisome precedent, well, buckle your seat belt, because the influence of big data is only going to grow in the years ahead. Going forward, each party will need to keep up with their rivals and outdo them in leveraging big data. This sets the stage for an ever-escalating technological arms race. Meanwhile, the parties’ consulting firms will be able to collect data from a host of new sources, such as networked refrigerators, monitoring your eating habits. As big data becomes gargantuan data, the sort of correlations that Cambridge Analytica was able to draw in 2016 may come to seem like child’s play. AI has long been a boogie man of science fiction stories and economic doomsayers alike, leading to fears of machines taking over the world – or at least taking over everyone’s jobs. These fears may be overblown, since they assume a level of AI that’s much more advanced than is likely to develop in the next 50 to 100 years. However, there’s a more realistic fear to have in the meantime: AI will reduce the number of people employed in a large swath of jobs – those involving routine tasks. AI is already good at performing these tasks. It’s not so good at dealing with unpredictable situations, especially if they require creative thought or sensorimotor skills. For example, driving on a highway is a pretty routine task that AI can handle. Truck drivers are therefore likely to be replaced by AI. Being a machine learning specialist or a gardener, in contrast, involves doing creative, non-routine and sensorimotor-heavy tasks that AI can’t handle for the foreseeable future. These workers will be safe. Thus, routine jobs will be eliminated, leaving mostly non-routine jobs behind. The problem with this is that non-routine jobs tend to be either very well paid (think Google employee) or very poorly paid (think delivery cyclist). The in-between, routine jobs tend to be those of the middle class – paralegals, accountants and radiologists, for example. With these jobs eliminated, the result will be a barbell-like economy with high-end, non-routine jobs on one end and low-end, non-routine jobs on the other. The gulf between the post-AI haves and have-nots will then grow even worse. As AI becomes increasingly important to the economy, AI specialists will be in demand and therefore better paid. Meanwhile, the laid-off workers from the routine jobs will compete for the low-end, non-routine jobs, putting a downward pressure on their wages. Democracy will suffer from the resulting inequality and destruction of the middle class, as these developments will deepen the divisions that are already beginning to tear it apart. That’s because inequality literally separates people – dividing the rich into one set of lives, jobs and neighborhoods and the poor into another. Meanwhile, the more the economy resembles a barbell, the more problems arise, such as a shrinking tax base and higher levels of crime, depression and addiction, which further exacerbate the social divisions. To turn an old saying upside down, as the poor get poorer, the rich get richer. The flipside of AI-powered technology taking over large swaths of the economy, eliminating many jobs, eviscerating the middle class and increasing inequality is that the companies pushing that technology are also going to become increasingly rich and powerful. Indeed, tech companies have an inherent tendency to become all-powerful monopolies. The very nature of their economic activity paves the way for them to achieve exponential growth that crowds out their competitors. There are two factors behind this. The first involves a phenomenon called the network effect. Essentially, if you’re a company providing a service that connects people into a network, your service becomes more desirable each time you connect another person to it. This entices more people to join it, which makes it even more desirable, which leads to even more people joining it, etc. For example, the more passengers that join Uber, the more drivers it attracts, so that Uber can provide better service – which leads to even more passengers joining Uber, and so on. The second factor involves the low-cost and high-speed at which tech companies can scale up their networks. For instance, it takes barely any time or money for Airbnb to add a new host to its network of lodgings, whereas it takes a lot of time and money for a hotel company to construct a new building. Now, the factors leading to the creation of tech monopolies may be novel, but monopolies themselves are nothing new. Like monopolies of the past, tech companies are using their power to buy influence with politicians. However, compared to monopolies of the past, tech companies can command an unprecedented amount of influence, for two reasons. First, political parties are uniquely dependent on tech companies, given how much they need digital platforms to reach potential voters. Second, owning those platforms gives tech companies unprecedented power to influence public debate and opinion. Indeed, they’re already starting to flex their muscles. For example, in opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act in 2012, Google added a link to a petition on its front page, which led to millions of signatures and helped kill the bill. What’s the first word that comes to mind when you hear the term “democracy?” For many people, it would probably be “freedom.” After all, individual liberty is an undeniably vital component of democracy. However, an equally vital component is the opposite of freedom: state coercion. To enforce laws that express the will of the people, the government must have a system of coercion in place to be able to do things like make people pay taxes. And to justify and organize this system, the state needs to control information like taxation records. However, the rise of a movement called crypto-anarchy is threatening the government’s ability to control information and thus its authority to coerce its citizens. What is crypto-anarchy? The short answer is that it’s a movement that seeks to undermine the authority of the state through encryption, which allows people to communicate, store and retrieve information beyond the reach of the government. A salient example is Bitcoin – an encrypted digital currency, or cryptocurrency, that enables people to make secure, quasi-anonymous transactions without a central government backing or controlling the currency's value or supply. Such a currency poses a threat to governments because it challenges their abilities to exercise state monopolies on money, monitor transactions and therefore collect taxes and pay themselves. Bitcoin, in turn, is just one example of blockchain technology, which stores information in an immense, disbursed and tamper-proof database. In the case of Bitcoin, independent records of each transaction are kept by thousands of computers linked together into a decentralized network. You can’t delete or edit one record without deleting or editing them all, which is virtually impossible. Further applications of this technology are already proliferating and will continue to spread, resulting in blockchain-based marketplaces and social media platforms that are impervious to government surveillance and interference. These marketplaces will allow the free flow of illegal products like drugs, personal data and child pornography. Meanwhile, social media platforms enable users to spread hate speech, illegal images and terrorist propaganda. Thus, the government would be powerless to remove from the blockchain network or even trace, let alone prosecute the users behind them. The result? The government’s laws – and by extension, the government itself – will become increasingly toothless, as malefactors become able to break them with impunity. What if humanity doesn’t correct its course from the path it’s currently on, which leads to growing citizen-disengagement, tribalism, electoral manipulation, inequality, monopoly power and crypto-anarchy? Well, there are two possibilities: a grim future – and an even grimmer future. Let’s start with the worst-case scenario. This would be an age of dystopian chaos in which governments lose their ability to function. Meanwhile, inequality increases until a tiny group of people ends up with all of the technology, wealth and power, while everyone else is forced to eke out a livelihood by serving the elite. As disorder grows and society eventually collapses, the rich retreat to heavily defended compounds, which are already being built by some of today’s tech elites, like Peter Thiel, the cofounder of PayPal, who recently purchased a 477-acre safe house in New Zealand. Now let’s look at the more likely, slightly less worse, alternative. This would be a form of techno-authoritarianism, which could unfold as follows. First, growing inequality leads to growing social problems, like depression, alcoholism and crime. This, in turn, leads to an increasing demand for big government services like police, healthcare, prisons and social service. However, because of its falling tax base due to inequality, the destruction of the middle class and the use of cryptocurrencies, the government is unable to meet the demand for these services. This leads to citizens being more distrustful of the government, which in turn leads them to withhold their compliance and resources from it. This further undermines its ability to meet their demands, and so forth and so on, leading to a downward spiral. Meanwhile, because of growing inequality, society becomes increasingly fractured, especially between the tech-haves and have-nots. The elites enjoy lives of technological luxury, while the burgeoning underclass struggles to make a living through jobs that are increasingly precarious and poorly paid. At some point, people will naturally conclude that democracy can no longer solve their social problems. Where will they turn? Here’s one sobering possibility: a techno-authoritarian riding a wave of enthusiasm for technological solutions to problems like crime, climate change and hunger. The tech-elite could easily slide into this role as well, buoyed by a belief that they and the technology they wield are better able to run society than \"the rabble.\" Once upon a time, ancient Greeks living in small cities were able to practice democracy on a face-to-face level. As society became too large and complex for that to work, representative democracy emerged to carry on the torch, which was then kept aloft by the mass party and taxation systems that materialized when industrialism and mass suffrage arrived. For some reason, however, democracy stopped evolving at that point. As a result, democracy is no longer in sync with social reality, and it’s unable to keep up with the massive, rapid, technology-driven changes taking place. To survive, democracy needs updates to combat the tendencies that are undermining it. Some of these updates involve governments reasserting their authority over the tech industry. For example, to limit the influence of big data, governments can exercise more oversight on the use of algorithms and data collection. To break up monopolies, they can enact antitrust legislation. To regulate cryptocurrencies, they can issue their own. And to ensure they and their citizens benefit from the gains of technology, rather than just tech companies, governments can develop publicly owned and operated versions of services and infrastructure projects like Uber and driverless car networks. Other updates involve governments protecting and supporting their citizens. For example, to help citizens become less susceptible to manipulation, the education system can be redesigned to better teach the critical thinking and digital literacy skills that they need to understand how to verify sources, how psychological biases work and how the main components of the digital world, such as targeting algorithms, function. To provide them with enough time and space to exercise those sharpened critical thinking skills, which they could use to sift through politicians' claims and promises, governments could also make election day a public holiday, replete with hustings, debates and meet-up groups. To combat inequality, the government can enforce minimum wage laws on employers who take advantage of the precarious freelance and short-term-contract labor that characterizes the so-called gig economy, make it easier for workers to unionize, invest in job creation in emerging industries such as climate change adaptation and biotech, and pay for training programs to help workers retool for the changing economy. Finally, to fund these new programs, the government will need to find new sources of tax revenue, since corporate and income tax revenues are likely to decrease. One way to do this would be to levy taxes on the robots that replace human workers. By implementing reforms like these, democracies can reassert their power over technology, which will help ensure it empowers, liberates and enriches us, rather than the opposite. The key message in these blinks: Digital technology has brought undeniable benefits to humanity, but it also poses equally undeniable challenges to democracy. These challenges stem from certain tendencies of technologically driven social changes that are unfolding before our eyes – tendencies that are already eroding the essential pillars of democracy. If left unchecked, these pillars may eventually crumble, leaving a dystopian or totalitarian state in the rubble. Fortunately, there are steps that governments can take to sync up with the internet era and thereby withstand the winds of change. There are also steps that individuals can take to aid these renovation efforts in their personal lives.  Actionable advice: Take control of your internet usage.  By taking control of how you use the internet, you can also take back some control of your life from the encroachments of digital technologies and the tech companies pushing them. For example, you can prevent advertisers from manipulating you by downloading ad blockers. You can escape the echo chambers that encourage tribalism by seeking out alternative sources of information and listening to opposing voices with an open mind. And you can escape the clutches of monopolies by seeking out smaller, more ethical companies that provide search engines, social media platforms and taxi services. Got feedback?

What to read next: The Net Delusion by Evgeny Morozow If Bartlett delivers some bad news about the techno-authoritarian future that might lie ahead of us, The Net Delusion paints an even bleaker picture: that future is already here. Digging through recent history, Morozow uncovers disturbing ways in which authoritarian regimes have used the internet to undermine the freedom of their citizens. Morozow’s evidence and arguments throw cold water on the utopian dreams that many people have pinned on the internet. Yes, the internet can foster liberty – but it can also promote tyranny and passivity in democratic and authoritarian societies alike. Morozow asks us not to despair, but to open our eyes to the dangers we face. To see them for yourself, we highly recommend the blinks to The Net Delusion.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

These sites represent the sheer volume of information accessible to people surfing the internet.  Yet far too much of this information is hidden behind poorly designed websites, pages so cluttered or unclear that no savvy browser not to mention newbie could begin to access the treasures within. It doesn’t have to be this way. If every website and mobile app today would simply follow a few important rules, the internet could be a much friendlier, organized place. If you and your business follow these rules, you’ll discover that not only will your users find useful information but also you’ll be able to direct users to exactly what you want them to see.  So what are the magical rules? Read these blinks to find out.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how everyone moves their eyes in the same fashion, regardless of background;  why people prefer less choice than more choice in general; and  how picturing yourself as an elderly person can change how you save cash.  Say you’re looking to book a hotel room in London. You search Google for accommodations, and are immediately given 500 million options. Obviously there’s no way you could consider each one –  but such is the peril of information overload in the twenty-first century.  The prominence of computers and the internet have prompted an exponential rise in the quantity of available information. In fact, scientists at IBM have estimated that the data created over just the last two years makes up 90 percent of all the information currently in existence! In the 1950s, for instance, people could choose among two or three TV channels. But today you can access just about every program ever made, and whenever you want, through cloud services.  Yet the amount of information that people actually pay attention to is limited by the cognitive capacity of the brain. For instance, research has suggested that a person’s short-term memory is only capable of storing about four pieces of information at a time. So whenever the information presented exceeds your brain’s capacity, you start missing out. For example, studies have found that having a phone conversation while driving causes you to stop noticing some 50 percent of your surroundings – red lights and pedestrians included.  Considering this, it’s easy to see how the abundance of online information inevitably leads to the waning attention of users. In short, people surfing the internet face difficult choices every second about what to notice and think about.  But there’s actually a great opportunity for companies to take advantage of the gap between the information that’s presented and the information that people notice. For instance, sites such as Booking.com or Hotels.com that offer a simple information platform online are able to charge hotel owners a commission as high as 30 percent. We’ll learn why they can do this in the next blink. You probably have heard of the dating app called Tinder. Users glance at profile pictures and in that split second, decide whether they’re interested in dating that person. Some 1.2 billion Tinder photos are swiped every single day! Tinder offers us a great example of how rapidly a person can form an opinion about a certain subject. How exactly do people make such quick decisions? Most of our choices and judgments are influenced by processes that occur before we’re conscious of what we’re actually looking at. So instead of weighing pros and cons rationally, our subconscious mind makes a near instantaneous judgment based on a first impression. So if you run a website, in order to get people to engage, you need to find a way to make your site appeal to a user’s subconscious. But most websites are drab, colorless things that rely on long streams of text instead of visual appeal to engage viewers. This sort of design can lead to a site being overly complicated and hard for a person to follow.  For instance, Bank of America’s landing page is a perfect example of a website that is overly complicated. It offers 68 links, 15 asymmetric text blocks using multiple fonts, sizes and colors, as well as three different menu bars. That’s a lesson in what not to do. Building an engaging website requires some visual complexity – that is, a perfect balance of color and detail. For instance, bright, engaging colors are key to grabbing a person’s attention. Once that’s done, the rest of your information needs to be presented in a clear, easy-to-understand format that doesn’t overburden the quick-thinking subconscious. In certain studies, participants were shown website screenshots so rapidly that they couldn’t possibly process them all consciously. Nonetheless, the sites that rated the highest for usability and trustworthiness were those that were visually appealing.  This is known as the halo effect, when one prominent feature of a product is so appealing that it influences a person’s judgment about the project as a whole. We’ve all been there: standing in a supermarket aisle, facing ten different brands of a certain product. Some people know exactly what they want, but if you don’t, you’re likely to pick an option located in the center of the shelf.  That’s because we perceive the world and make decisions based on what’s known as the middle bias.  Our eyes don’t move systematically from side to side when we see something, but instead jump around in a predictable pattern. As you might have guessed, this pattern tends to reach its end in the “center.” Studies conducted with candy have found that human’s middle bias is so powerful that test participants would choose a sweet placed in the center, even if their favorite candy was included in the group but far off to the side. So if you want someone to click on a link, the best place for the link to exist is smack dab in the center of the screen.  But placing items centrally isn’t the only way to get people to notice them. You can also highlight specific options to boost the chances of selection. This tends to work especially well when people aren’t on the hunt for something specific, or when they’re experiencing a cognitive load such as while multitasking. It’s simple: the brightest-colored option will often be the one that’s chosen.  After scanning around jerkily, however, a person’s eyes will then move horizontally. To turn this fact to your advantage, it’s essential to carefully consider which information you’ll organize in rows and which in columns.  For example, Dell Computer built on this fact to list its computer models in columns on its website, and other information, such as prices, in horizontal rows.  Yet researchers found that customers were more focused on the horizontal rows and therefore focused their search on the cheapest computer. But when Dell switched the information around, customers spent more time looking at the products, now on the horizontal plane, and less time focusing on price. It’s always better for things to be easy, right? Well, maybe not. People are happy when they don’t have to struggle to perform a task, yet this might not always be to your benefit. Here’s why.  Easy-to-use websites work well because a user can access content and services simply. For the most part this is a desired outcome, but making your website too easy can create its own issues. For instance, Uber’s simple interface often comes into conflict with the company’s policy of surge pricing, during which prices rise with demand.  In general, with just a few clicks a user can get out of a storm and into a nice, dry car taking them home. Yet at peak times, prices go up as more users log in to find rides. While it’s still just a few clicks to reserve a car, that trip during a surge pricing period might cost a customer $150 for even a short ride. And this means unhappy customers and loads of complaints.  So sometimes making an online service more efficient means making it a bit harder to use. In fact, studies have found that by producing disfluency, that is making something more challenging to read, you can actually improve people’s attention and their long-term memory. Slowing down makes people process information more deeply, thereby activating more deliberate thinking.  There are plenty of ways to encourage this, from using an unfamiliar font or unusual layout to even having users manually enter information. For instance, Uber now has a user type in the exact number by which a standard rate is multiplied during peak hours. This simple process forces the user to slow down and ensures he or she knows how much the ride will actually cost.  The point is, if you want your customers to get something done quickly, make it easy. But if you want them to carefully consider certain information, a bit of disfluency can go a long way.  Have you ever thought about how to best provide feedback? It’s an important question, because in order to have a lasting impact, comments and criticism need to be presented in the correct way.  In fact, the proper balance of feedback follows an inverted u-curve. Too little feedback will prevent learning, as the recipient won’t see how she can improve. It’s for this reason that bathroom scales alone aren’t an effective way to shed pounds, as you’re just given a number, but don’t know how to change it. On the other hand, too much feedback can overwhelm and cause a person to ignore much of the information given. This is why certain smartphone apps that allow you to track everything, from body fat to the ingredients in every meal, haven’t really contributed to reducing obesity rates. That much information is simply too much for most people. But it’s not just important to give feedback. It’s also key to present the feedback well, and this means giving it to people exactly when they need it. For instance, the Personal Capital mobile app lets users track finances in real time, allowing them to review their balance while in line to buy something. Feedback should also make clear how a person is to achieve a desired outcome. For example, the Red Alert app was built to warn Israeli residents about potential missile attacks. When an alarm sounds, the app displays directions to the closest bomb shelter. So the app doesn’t just warn a user but also tells him exactly how to avoid danger.  It’s also important that feedback produces an emotional response in the recipient. For instance, an internet-connected pill bottle called the GlowCap shines with different colored lights then makes sounds, all with the goal of producing a feeling of urgency in the patient to take his medicine. In a world chock-full of generic information, personalization is key to getting a message across.  Consider hotel managers concerned about the environment and their laundry bills. Placing a sign in a hotel room’s shower that reads, “Please reuse your towels,” doesn’t do much to motivate the average guest. Yet “75 percent of guests in this room use their towels more than once” is far more effective, as it speaks directly to the person as they dry off.  The best part is, it’s relatively easy and inexpensive to personalize digital content. For instance, international beverage company Coca-Cola ran an experimental campaign on billboards located on certain highways in Tel Aviv. Once a special smartphone app was downloaded, when a person drove past the billboard, it would display that person’s name in huge letters.  In just a few weeks, the special Coca-Cola app was downloaded over 100,000 times, and the campaign overall increased customer engagement with the company brand significantly.  Or consider the free app called AgingBooth, which adds effects to photos that make a person look much older. Studies have found that when a person is asked to put away money for a hypothetical retirement fund, that person will save twice as much after seeing an image of himself as elderly. It’s easy to see how banks and financial service providers could benefit from such software! So personalizing information is important, but timing your outreach strategy is also essential to achieving a desired effect. One way companies can do this is through the fresh start effect, a technique that can help people lose weight, get in shape or save money. The technique works by urging people to make changes on certain days. For instance, researchers at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania have found that people are much more likely to work on goals toward the beginning of the week, month or year. But important dates like birthdays or retirement are also effective. Are you familiar with the website, Healthcare.gov? This site was built to help American citizens select an insurance plan personalized to their specific needs.  The website showcases 78,000 different insurance plans and gives people the freedom to choose their favorite. However, studies have shown that on average, users choose a plan that’s too expensive for their budget by about $900. How could this be the case? Well, when given a choice that’s complicated by an overwhelming amount of data, people either make incorrect decisions or make no decision at all.  To better understand this, a study organized by academics from Columbia and Stanford universities compared two marmalade stands that allowed customers to taste and buy jam. One stand offered 24 different choices, while the other offered only six.  When customers visited the first stand with its many choices, only three percent of people made a purchase. But at the other stand where options were limited, 30 percent of visitors bought jam.   This stems from a feeling called buyer’s remorse, or when a person immediately questions a purchase after it is completed, worrying if the product purchased was indeed the “right” one.  The plethora of choice in the digital world only enforces this dread. While the average supermarket carries about 220 different breakfast cereal brands, online retailer Amazon.com offers nearly 2,000! So the solution is to establish guided decision making, helping customers to identify the option that’s right for them.  For instance, the author proposed such a strategy for a couple looking to find a house in a popular city. He first had them narrow down all their options to about 16, using different categories such as location, size and access to good schools.  Then the couple entered a serious decision-making phase. The author set up a system in which four options would appear on a screen; the couple was only allowed to choose one of the four, losing the other options forever. The end result left them with just four houses from which to choose, a much easier amount of choice to manage.  Remember, strategies like this are effective because customers don’t actually want unlimited options, but instead a curated selection. The way humans perceive and respond to digital information is highly predictable. By taking these patterns into account when designing your website, you can ensure that your business will grab the attention of your desired audience as they navigate through a sea of digital options.

We would, in all likelihood, instinctively turn toward big cities and renowned universities. But we would be wrong. Instead, it’s former industrial sites, the traditional domain of factory workers, mechanics and builders that are the new centers of knowledge and innovation. Combining the practical skills and experience of technical workers with the creative brainpower of polytechnic institutes and universities, these thriving new hubs are developing solutions to the major global problems facing us right now. Welcome to the “brainbelts”! In these blinks, you’ll learn why there is still space for manufacturing companies in the West; where the smartest people in the world live; and which projects and ideas the world’s smartest people are developing.  Have you heard the term rustbelts? It refers to formerly industrial areas in the United States and Europe, places that have largely declined in affluence because of the offshoring of manufacturing to cheaper production sites in countries such as China, Bangladesh, Mexico and Turkey. But that’s all starting to change. Some of these rustbelt regions are transforming into brainbelts; regions that have been revitalized through the formation of hubs that unite knowledgeable workers with smart manufacturing. Just take the new production facility created by General Electric, an iconic company that produces aircraft engines and household appliances, among other products. Rather than offshoring their production to Asia, GE set up shop in Batesville, Mississippi because of its close proximity to Mississippi State University. In this new location, researchers work with cutting-edge materials to revolutionize the production of aircraft engines. GE had already been working with the university and, because of the great results the collaboration was producing, decided to become its neighbor. The choice has proven to be a boon to GE, as the work between the two institutions brings together innovation and smart manufacturing. However, just because some companies succeed with this model doesn’t mean that emerging markets in the East are no longer a threat; rather, these markets are just facing stiffer competition. For instance, many Western industrial powerhouses have had to close their doors, overwhelmed by the low-cost production model – built largely on cheap labor – employed in East Asian countries. That being said, the rise of brainbelts is causing concern for some Asian companies. Just consider the Taiwan-based Mediatek; for years, they’ve been a powerful force in the global marketplace, designing chipsets for smartphones and other such electronics. Despite this success, the company’s CFO, David Ku, has expressed grave concerns about the increasingly competitive nature of US firms. He pointed to the San Diego-based company Qualcomm as an example, saying that they’re way ahead of the game in terms of research and development. So, you now know why brainbelts are important. Next, you’ll learn how exactly they come about. Although each brainbelt is unique, they all share certain basic characteristics. One common characteristic of brainbelts is a collaborative ecosystem to which countless people contribute. Here’s how these structures function: Generally, brainbelts operate with a research university at their core. From this base, a variety of other institutions branch out, which can include start-ups or more established firms, community colleges and local governmental authorities. Each of these different institutions are closely interwoven into one another’s activities. Just consider the Hudson Tech Valley in Albany, NY, also known as the Albany brainbelt. At the center of this grouping is the State University of New York and the private research university Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. These core institutions are surrounded by manufacturing businesses and community colleges, all of which collaborate on semiconductor research, which plays a significant role in computer technology. Another core attribute of brainbelts is an openness to sharing knowledge and expertise. This results in freedom between sectors, such as industry and academia, but also between disciplines, like math and biology. Instead of being hoarded, knowledge and expertise are shared to undertake the complicated projects that come to define these brainbelts. Beyond that, companies within brainbelts tend to be highly specialized, which means their knowledge rarely overlaps with that of their collaborators. This is key, as it keeps the threat of competition to a minimum. A great example is the Oregon Health & Science University located in Portland. This institution had collected a wealth of data on cancer patients, but didn’t have the computing power necessary to process it. Intel, also a major player in the Portland area, was able to pool its computers to process the university’s data. The two partners were excited to share their knowledge and expertise since they weren’t in direct competition. Quite the contrary, each depended on the ability of the other, and they were thus glad to work together. But these aren’t the only key characteristics shared by brainbelts. In the next blink, you’ll learn about a few more. Do you consider yourself a focused person? Well, not everyone does. Some people want to be doctors one day and geologists the next. But for brainbelts, this isn’t an issue. Another main characteristic of these innovative sites is their focused effort. Instead of taking on a wide range of activities, brainbelts invest their energy in just one or two. For instance, the Hudson Tech Valley in Albany works primarily on semiconductors like chips and sensors, while the life-science brainbelt in Zurich, Switzerland focuses on biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals. Another defining feature of brainbelts is their use of smart manufacturing. Unlike traditional manufacturing operations that are focused on cost and worker efficiency, brainbelts’ smart manufacturing strategy emphasizes concepts such as customization and automation by using technologies like 3-D printing and robotics. For example, the authors visited America Makes in Youngstown, Ohio, which was formerly known as the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute. During their trip, they met Kevin Collier, who manages the Innovation Factory there. He told them that 3-D printing enables both rapid production of prototypes and real manufacturing. So, while aircraft manufacturers can use 3-D printing to create certain engine components, people in medicine can also use this technology to produce customized body parts, like personalized hips and knees for injured veterans. Not only that, but robotics allows for automation that’s both cheap and smart. Just consider Baxter, a humanoid robot used by Scott Eckert, president of the Boston-based firm Rethink Robotics. Baxter works as an assistant at the company, lifting and rearranging various objects, including other robots. He cost $22,000 to produce, which is a pittance considering he can work for 6,500 hours without getting sick or taking a vacation. That breaks down to an hourly wage of just three dollars! Now that we’re getting a clearer picture of how brainbelts work, let’s take a closer look at one in particular to see how it rose from the ashes of collapsed industries. If you’re searching for examples of industrial hubs that went from great to bad and back to great again, you need look no further than Akron, Ohio. Here’s the story of this rustbelt-turned-brainbelt: Because of its strategic location, Akron used to be an industrial powerhouse. Its convenient location near Detroit and right between New York City and Chicago made the Detroit car industry a key contributor to its supply chain and resulted in tire giants like Firestone and Goodyear basing their operations in Akron. The city’s location also made Akron an essential railway hub in the transportation of cereal grains produced in the region. For instance, Quaker Oats did a great deal of business in the area, reflected by the proliferation of the company’s massive grain silo complexes. But then, in the mid-twentieth century, things began to shift as Akron failed to account for the competitive threat arising overseas. After years of profitable, stable business, the tire companies had become too accustomed to their success; they were so detached and inward-looking that they failed to take notice of their powerful competitors in China and Mexico, and adapt their business strategies accordingly. When they finally did wake up to this reality, it was too late. Akron withered away into dormancy and the sites were abandoned. Well, for a little while at least – the brainpower of these industries remained, which was central to Akron’s eventual revival. Many of the skilled workers who had previously worked in the tire industry began their own firms. In addition, the president of the University of Akron, Luis Proenza, began to reposition the university to become a strong central force in the city. Much of the industrial and educational work in Akron was focused on polymer science, which was quickly broadening into the realm of new materials science. By sticking to a field in which many local residents were already skilled, Akron managed to rebuild its success. One great example is Akron Polymer Systems. Working with polymers, this firm develops films for the LCD screens used in solar cells, among many other things. Climate change is probably the single greatest challenge facing humanity in the twenty-first century. For far too long, we’ve extracted and burned dirty fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. But there’s still hope for the future. New technology being developed and manufactured in the brainbelts could help mitigate some of the devastating effects caused by human-initiated climate change. After all, our only hope today is to develop new, cheap sources of renewable energy, which is exactly what many brainbelts are focusing on. Just consider the Centennial Campus in North Carolina. At this site, the company ABB is collaborating with university researchers to improve certain components of the electrical grid. This existing network of lines ensures the delivery of energy from producers to consumers – but it could be made a whole lot smarter. For instance, consumers could become their own producers, creating, storing and even selling their own energy, as made possible by home solar panels. By helping make such technologies an accessible reality, brainbelts are contributing to counteracting climate change. Another pressing issue that brainbelts are working on is the need to feed all of the 9 billion people who are expected to live on earth by 2050. To meet this gargantuan goal, we’ll need agricultural innovations in areas like greenhouse design and automated milking. Such technologies could help farmers meet the production needs for their local markets, and a prime example is the brainbelt surrounding the town of Wageningen in the Netherlands. The agricultural university there has partnered with several organizations of farmers and companies to boost productivity and efficiency in Dutch agriculture. Such collaboration has enabled this relatively small country to deliver an incredible 7.5 percent of all global food exports. Unless you were some kind of infant prodigy, you likely weren’t born with the ability to ride a bike. Kids need training wheels to get them going before they can ride on their own, and the same goes for brainbelts. To capture their full potential, these areas sometimes need a bit of help. This is important to note since, when people think of innovation, they tend to think of industry leaders like Apple, Google and Amazon. These companies have done exceedingly well at building immense technology empires and have all the resources and talent they need to keep innovating and succeeding. Unlike these titans of industry, brainbelts are weighed down by past stagnation, abandoned buildings and out-of-date infrastructure. That being said, they have the brainpower they need to shake off these disadvantages – as long as they can get a helping hand. One way such assistance can be provided to brainbelts is through national innovation policies and guidelines, as well as continued funding. Innovation policies and guidelines are essentially motivators for innovation and are therefore a big boon to brainbelts. While most countries have such policies on the books, not all of them do. Consider the United States. Although the US government has funded initiatives to encourage innovation over the years, there are no standing guidelines to support these expenditures. While people often look to Silicon Valley and assume that there’s no need for such policies, there are other young brainbelts all over the country – and, indeed, around the world – that would benefit tremendously from a helping hand. Beyond the need for policy support, continued funding is also crucial to newly emerging brainbelts. Luckily, many funding sources are available, from national governments to private companies. However, the process is far from perfect, since many of these resources are invested in the wrong projects. Just take the US technology sector. Lots of investors pour their money into Google and Apple, but fail to invest in the cross-disciplinary and innovative projects at the heart of the brainbelts. The key message in this book: The power dynamics of market forces are gradually shifting in the global marketplace. Sites of former industrial glory in the West, which have been decimated by the low-cost production methods of Eastern firms, are rapidly rebuilding themselves through the innovative use of shared brainpower.

King Kong, Tarzan, the army of primates in Planet of the Apes, the orangutans at the zoo – when it comes to apish things, we humans seem unable to get enough. And maybe it makes sense, since they’re our closest evolutionary cousins. In fact, we might be far more closely related to other primates than was previously thought. Homo sapiens is a complex and fascinating species – a species that, in this age of technology and automation, has never been more important to understand. These blinks explain a revelation that has opened up new opportunities for understanding human essence and human evolution – an understanding that has both its beautiful and its brutal side. In these blinks, you’ll find out why chimpanzees are counted as humans by some taxonomists; how human language may have emerged; and why we might all have been better off as hunter-gatherers. The similarities between humans and other primates aren’t hard to spot. But exactly how genetically similar are we to our wild cousins, and which ones are our closest relatives? Scientists are now able to look at the human genome and calculate exactly how alike humans and apes are. The results are pretty striking. We share 96.4 percent of our genes with orangutans, 97.7 percent with gorillas and an incredible 98.6 percent with chimpanzees. Effectively, that means that a mere 1.4 percent of our DNA distinguishes us from chimpanzees. Of that percentage, only a small amount contains the genetic tools that helped us develop those attributes we consider uniquely human, such as language, art and technology. In fact, we're so genetically close to chimps that some scientists even consider us part of the same family. In most encyclopedias, you'll find humans and chimpanzees classed in the same order, the Primates, and the same superfamily, the Hominoidea, but in separate families: the Hominidae for humans and Pongidae for chimpanzees. However, one school of taxonomy – known as the cladistics – arranges species based on relative genetic distance. Using this method, humans and chimps are part of not only the same family, but even the same genus. They conceive of not one but three separate species within the Homo genus: Homo troglodytes, the common chimpanzee; Homo paniscus, the bonobo; and us, Homo sapiens. Being in the same genus means the species are very closely related, so much so that sometimes they might be distinguishable only to experts. Take the willow warblers and the chiffchaffs as an example. These European birds share 97.7 percent of the same DNA and look virtually identical. But they're less closely related to each other than humans are to chimps. So we’re a lot like our chimp cousins – but it’s our few different characteristics, as well as art, technology and language, that really mark our species out. According to many anthropologists, human development underwent a “great leap forward” about 40,000 years ago in Europe. But to really understand human evolution, we’ve got to begin a lot earlier than that – at the first stage of human evolution. Around 3 million years ago, two distinct species of early humans could be identified, quite separate from apes. These were Australopithecus robustus, which died out 1.2 million years ago, and Australopithecus africanus. Australopithecus africanus later evolved into Homo habilis and Homo habilis evolved into Homo erectus. Homo erectus had larger brains and bodies and, soon enough, they began to expand their territory from Africa into Asia and Europe. Homo erectus underwent further anatomical changes and, around 500,000 years ago, evolved into Homo sapiens. Anatomical changes could only get us so far, however. It was the development of language, unique to humans, that really allowed us to make major strides. To speak, you need the right larynx, tongue and associated muscle structure. Humans use this to produce a range of sounds that, in turn, can be manipulated to produce language. Chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans can’t speak because they don’t have that structure. Scientists believe that proto-humans also lacked this structure, and that even Homo sapiens wasn’t physically equipped for speech for the first 460,000 years of its existence. As Homo sapiens developed language, the great leap forward began. A subtle change in anatomy meant we suddenly had the vocal control and range suitable for speaking a language. We could now communicate images, ideas and instructions more quickly and effectively. Language also enabled us to develop art and technology. So what exactly was this early language like? For centuries, sophisticated human language and communication seemed utterly unlike the grunts and howls of the lower beasts. But scientists have recently analyzed animal communication methods and have shown that they’re actually not so distant from human language. The animal that has probably come closest to developing a \"language” is the vervet, a small African monkey. Electronic analysis of vervets has shown that they react with different vocalizations to different environmental stimuli. Attacks from leopards, eagles or snakes, for instance, cause the vervets to produce varying sound-alarms. They also produce distinct sounds in various social contexts and they can communicate with grunts to indicate whether something is edible or inedible. So it seems that a general speaking ability is not so unique to humans. There’s even a way we can imagine how humans first developed languages. In the fifteenth century, the first wave of European colonization began, and, over the course of the next four centuries, countless trading posts were established. But, at first at least, it was very difficult to get any trading done, because there was no way for traders from different lands to communicate and work together. And so simple languages known as pidgins emerged. These contained elements of the various traders’ different native languages. Later generations spoke this or that pidgin as a native language, and enriched them with more vocabulary and a more complex grammar. These new languages are called creoles. The fascinating point is that although pidgins and creoles have been created all over the globe – and all independent from each other at that – they still share features, like similar grammars. The subject-verb-object order is used for statements; prepositions are common; double negatives are frequent; and monosyllabic words are often toneless. These common features indicate that human languages may have developed in much the same way that creoles developed. Let's turn away from language now and examine another aspect of human diversity: racial characteristics. As you’ve doubtless noticed, not all human beings look the same. There are tall humans and short humans, humans with lighter skin and humans with darker skin. These are known as racial characteristics, and there are two scientific theories that posit how they developed: natural selection and sexual selection. Most biologists are proponents of natural selection. This theory claims that racial characteristics emerged in order to improve a population’s chances of survival. For instance, the large chests of Andean Indians enable them to absorb more oxygen from the thin air found at high altitudes. But natural selection doesn’t really explain other characteristics, such as skin color. Advocates of natural selection suggest that darker skin emerged in areas of the world that get the most sunlight. But that doesn’t explain why some native peoples have dark skin in places like Tasmania or in parts of equatorial West Africa. And as for differences in hair and eye color, or genitalia, natural selection has no explanatory clout. In addition to natural selection, Charles Darwin proposed the theory of sexual selection. This theory can fill in some of the gaps that natural selection leaves open. Sexual selection is simple enough in theory. Say a female has a set of physical characteristics that males find attractive. Since this female’s characteristics are attractive to males, she’ll have an easier time finding a mate and procreating. Her offspring may then inherit some of her attractive characteristics, thus raising their chances of finding a mate and procreating. Over the course of generations, the physical traits – such as hair color, eye color and the size or shape of genitalia – that increase the likelihood of finding a mate within a given region are perpetuated, and those that diminish it are weeded out. This means that sexual selection spreads characteristics that don’t necessarily increase survival rates in and of themselves, but do result in the proportional increase of these sexual characteristics in a given population. Most likely it’s a combination of these two theories that has led to the gradual development of distinct racial characteristics. Most historians and anthropologists believe that humanity’s embracing of agriculture increased quality of life and gave us the free time to develop art and new technologies. Nowadays, however, that logic is being turned on its head. Hunter-gatherers actually had a higher quality of life than later farmers. Studies of the few remaining hunter-gatherer populations indicate that they had plenty of leisure time and worked no harder than farmers. Today, Kalahari bushmen only spend twelve to nineteen hours a week gathering food. How many farmers can claim to work as little as that? Additionally, archeological evidence shows that hunter-gatherers were much healthier than farming populations who lived in the same regions at a later date. Paleontologists looked at skeletons from Greece and Turkey dated to the end of the last Ice Age. In that region, the average height of hunter-gatherers was 172 cm. Once agriculture was adopted, though, this average dropped to just 157 cm. This change clearly tells a tale: these communities were less nourished than those who had lived there before. Farming only supplanted hunting and gathering because agriculture was able to support populations larger in number. Simply put, agriculture supplies more food per capita than hunting and gathering. Those populations that took up agriculture increased rapidly. Once they were greater in number, they were able to use that advantage to push the healthier, but fewer, hunter-gatherers to the margins. From that point on, agriculture took hold and became the primary method for supplying food. The population boom that followed the adoption of agriculture was the reason why agricultural societies progressed further in terms of technology and culture than hunter-gatherer societies. They simply had more people, more minds that could busy themselves with societal advances. You probably think that only perverted psychopaths resort to genocide. But you’d be wrong. History shows us that genocide is no one-off phenomenon, and that each of us could potentially commit it. For starters, many instances of genocide have simply been forgotten by the vast majority of humanity. Consider, for instance, the nearly forgotten mistreatment of the native population of Tasmania by British settlers. In about 1800, the Brits arrived on the island, where they “discovered” a native population of roughly 5,000 hunter-gatherers whose technology had advanced no further than stone tools. By 1869, only three native Tasmanians remained. The rest had been killed or kidnapped. In the twentieth century, there were at least 26 cases involving the genocide of racial, national, ethnic, religious or political groups. Some of these were smaller in scale, such as the abuse of the Aché Indians in Paraguay in the 1970s. Others, like the Armenian genocide in Turkey, were much larger. In this particular case, roughly a million people were killed between 1915 and 1917. In fact, genocide – or attempted genocide – is so common that it must be considered a part of human nature. Though we might find the idea repugnant, we are all potential participants in genocidal massacre. And those who do attempt it will always find ways to explain away their actions. Some, like the Hutu people, claim self-defense. They murdered more than 500,000 Tutsi during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Others rationalize their killings by claiming them as necessary for advancing what they consider the “correct\" religion, race or political belief. That sort of justification is exemplified by the Indonesians who killed close to a million supposed communist sympathizers between 1965 and 1966. Comparing the victims to animals is also a recurrent justificatory gambit. French settlers in Algeria, for instance, portrayed local Muslims as rats. It’s debatable whether humans will be able to quell genocidal urges in the future, but maybe – just maybe – we can. Ever since the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century, primitive peoples have been portrayed as noble savages – as a purer kind of person living in harmony with nature. However, we now know that human societies have always posed a threat to the environment. It’s emerged that the Māori, shortly after they first reached New Zealand, exterminated the moa, a large, flightless bird. When European settlers arrived later, they found the bones and eggshells of the already-extinct moa. Ever since, scientists have been puzzling over just what happened. Initially, they rejected the idea that the Māori had killed them, assuming that the Māori had had a deep respect for nature. However, more than a hundred archaeological sites have shown that the Māori used to kill moas for meat, eggs and bones. It’s they who probably drove the bird to extinction. In fact, an estimated 100,000 moa skeletons lie in these field sites. It’s no one-off case. The exploitation of the environment is simply part and parcel of human existence. Consider the advanced indigenous civilization whose environment exploitation backfired on them. When Spanish explorers reached New Mexico, they found towering, uninhabited structures built in the middle of the desert. They belonged to a lost civilization that the indigenous Americans had termed the “Ancient Ones.” Paleobotanists – scientists who reconstruct environments and landscapes from the past using plant fossils and remains – have demonstrated that, at the time this civilization started building its cities, woodland grew all about. However, the people exploited this resource for timber and firewood until it became the barren wasteland that exists today. By cutting down all the trees, the Ancient Ones also essentially ruined the natural underground water-storage system on which they’d depended. Eventually, their irrigation water dropped below the level of their fields, and the subsequent drought led to the collapse of their civilization. It’s pretty clear now that the belief that past societies were strident champions of environmentalism is a prime example of romantic blather. On the contrary, our ancestors didn’t know how much devastation they were capable of causing. But we do. And if we end up destroying our planet, it won't be out of ignorance, but out of catastrophic negligence. The key message in this book: Throughout our long history, humans have shown a capacity for both remarkable achievements and terrible mistakes. Now, in an era when technology has maximized our potential for both good and evil, a deeper understanding of human nature and human history may play a crucial role in preventing humanity’s downfall.

But it’s not just unhealthy for you, it’s doing great harm to the environment.  These blinks will take you on a journey of the life of food: how it is produced, how monoculture wiped out former agricultural practices, how the oceans are being destroyed, and why we need to rethink the way we eat to create a healthier, sustainable and better-tasting cuisine. In these blinks, you’ll learn how monoculture caused the Dust Bowl;  how you get your carrot to burst with sweet flavor; and what the risotto of the future looks like. What springs to mind when you think of a quality restaurant meal? Perhaps a large cut of meat or fish and some vegetables on the side drizzled with a special sauce? Sounds delicious, but what does a meal like this mean for the environment? Most of us in the Western world are lucky enough to be able to eat just about any kind of food we want. However, most of us also fail to realize that it’s environmentally unsustainable. With increasing populations and changing food habits, our ecology is being threatened. And while population control is extremely difficult to put into action, we can change the way we eat. And chefs can help us do it.  Chefs create food trends and influence how and what we eat at home. For example, many restaurants focus on meat and fish, products that require a wealth of natural resources to produce. Vegetables, meanwhile, only play a supporting role.  Restaurants also often center on eating high on the animal. In other words, eating the cuts of meat that are literally high on the animal’s body, like beef or fish filets. These cuts have become popular for their tenderness and because they look great on a plate. The problem is, each animal can only provide few such cuts. As a result, we use less of the animal’s meat than ever before. To make matters worse, as the meat market grows, so does the need to feed these animals. For example, one pound of beef requires a whopping 13 pounds of grain feed to produce. This puts a massive strain on our environment. So we’re faced with the need to find a sustainable cuisine. This cuisine, let’s call it the third plate, needs to use more food varieties in order for it to be sustainable. Having the world turn vegetarian isn’t the answer, as our ecological system is based on animals and plants existing alongside one another. Rather, we need to understand the complexity of our ecosystems and the diversity required to sustain them. Bread, pasta, pastries, couscous… They all have one thing in common: wheat. But where does all this wheat come from? Historically, wheat was processed in gristmills that ground the whole kernel of the wheat, producing a wheat rich in minerals, protein and fatty acids. But this method also meant that the wheat only kept for about a week. Modern production techniques have changed that. When roller mills were introduced in the late nineteenth century, the germ of the wheat, which contains the minerals, protein and fatty acids, was removed in the milling process. As a result, wheat not only had a longer shelf life, but could be grown and milled far from where it was consumed. World War I and legislation exacerbated the circumstances. During the war, Europe ran out of wheat. But the new properties of roller-milled wheat enabled the United States to export wheat to Europe without it rotting first. In addition to roller mills, the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909, which made it possible to obtain 320 acres of free land in the new western territories, led to record-high wheat yields. In 1917, a total of 65 million acres of wheat was harvested. To make that number a bit more tangible, that’s equivalent to about 50 million football fields. In 1919, this number climbed to 75 million acres. The Midwest was now a vast monoculture of grain production. Today, wheat is one of the most consumed foods in the United States, with the average American devouring 130 pounds of it per year. That’s more than beef, lamb, veal and pork combined, and more than any other grain – aside from the sweeteners extracted from corn. Because we eat so much of it, and because we need so much to raise animals, grain is now the United States’ most important agricultural product. And it has a huge impact on our environment. Picture boundless golden stretches of corn and wheat, the wind billowing through it. Doesn’t sound so bad, does it? Unfortunately, there’s a nasty downside to it. Monoculture, or the practice of growing one type of plant in one area, wreaks havoc on the soil and drains its nutrients. But there is hope: namely, traditional farming techniques. Native Americans, for example, used the three sisters technique, where corn, beans and squash were all grown together, each playing vital roles in replenishing the earth’s nutrients. In this method, beans bind nitrogen from the air and into the ground via their roots, which is ideal for the nitrogen-loving corn, which in turn gives the beans something to climb on. Finally, the squash helps bind carbon, a nutrient for soil, and provides the plant roots with shade, which helps keep the water in the soil. This is a far cry from what happens in modern agriculture. Modern agriculture is based on monocultures and this unnatural process literally turns the soil to dust. And yet, going back to the three sister method and other similar techniques isn’t ideal either, as the crops are much harder to harvest mechanically.  With the expansion of the roller mill and increased wheat demand, hard wheat emerged as the preferred type to use in production. However, since hard wheat roots are shallow in comparison to older kinds of wheat, they are also more susceptible to drought. In the 1930s, this resulted in the Dust Bowl, when the previously healthy prairies that had been turned into farmland became so dry that their soils blew into the air, forming dust clouds over America, blocking the sun and forcing settlers in the Midwest to pick up and leave. Techniques to make chemicals for bomb production during the war were then repurposed to produce fertilizers, which in turn refertilized the soil and maintained these frail monocultures. But there’s an adverse trade-off with this method: it stuffs our rivers and waterways with excessive amounts of chemical fertilizer residues. Since soil is food for the plants that grow in it, imagine what happens to them if they only eat junk food. That’s what’s happening today: food grown in monocultures lacks nutrients, which affects our health.  When plants can’t get what they need to thrive from the soil, they become stressed. Just like us, this makes them more susceptible to sickness and pests. In the mid-twentieth century, agronomist William Albrecht shed some light on how health and soil quality correlate with one another. He reviewed the draft records for WWII in Missouri and discovered that out of 1000 recruits from an area with poor soil, 400 were rejected, compared to only 200 in a rich soil area. During the last 50 to 70 years, up to 40 percent of nutrients have been lost in what researchers call biomass dilution. Some scientists argue that a lack of micronutrients might be the culprit behind higher obesity rates, since we now need to consume more calories in order to get enough nutrients and feel satisfied. Another argument for changing the way we grow food is that it simply tastes better when it’s grown in nutrient-rich soil. At Stone Barns, the author’s restaurant and farm, they grow carrots in healthy soil. These carrots contain 16.9 percent sugar and are bursting with flavor. A stark contrast to industry-farmed organic carrots, which, when tested, registered at 0 percent sugar. Plants living in good soil absorb micronutrients in a process similar to making coffee. Think of it like this: when hot water drips slowly through ground coffee beans, the coffee will be richer than if it is made by pouring hot water over whole coffee beans. So it’s clear that bad soil equals bad food for us, but what about the animals that also live off it? Picture-perfect scenes of chickens frolicking freely around the barnyard were a reality a few decades ago. But times have drastically changed since then. What happened? The American broiler chicken: a prime example of how we’ve industrialized meat production. It started with The Perdue Chicken Company, founded in the 1920s to produce eggs; chicken meat was only a by-product. But when Frank Perdue, the son of the eponymous founder, took over the company, he saw the chance to focus on meat production. With the help of new, specialized breeds, grain-fed chickens could now reach their slaughter weight in just seven weeks – half the time it took before. Frank boosted his profits by making his own grain feed, which reduced the cost of chicken rearing. This cheap feed, combined with the rapidly growing broilers, helped make chicken rearing a large-scale production. This same process can be seen in all meat production. The story of the farmed chicken is also an example of how we now consume less of the animal. Ever notice how most of our chicken is sold in parts? Up until the 1970s, 80 percent of chickens were sold whole, with bones and skin. However, Perdue and their competitors spotted an opportunity for profit if the chicken was cut into smaller pieces.  This idea was supported by the low-calorie health trends of the 1980s and 1990s, when boneless, skinless, lean chicken grew by 50 percent. At the end of the 1990s, pared down, processed chicken accounted for 80 percent of purchased chicken. So we now eat less of the chicken, even though we produce 37 billion tons of it in the United States per year. And what happens to all the parts we don’t eat? They’re turned into fertilizers, dog food and the like. And the same process applies to the other animals. So what’s the alternative to such wasteful farming? Read on to the next blink to find out.  The Spanish word tierra is often translated as land. But it’s far more than that: it’s the earth, roots, climate and so on – a complex, biodiverse place. The dehesa, in the Southern region of Extremadura in Spain, is one example of this. Once filled with flocks of Merino sheep, the land is sectioned off by stone, crops and oak trees. On the surface it might seem barren, but it’s home to one of the world’s most beloved foods. The world’s best ham, Jamón Ibérico de Bellota, hails from the dehesa. This ham comes from the Iberian pig, whose food of choice is acorns, which give the ham its signature nutty flavor. As the pigs are free to roam and exercise, their muscles make room for oleic acid, which comes from the acorns and is the same unsaturated fat found in olive oil. The pigs do not receive any additional food – they feed only off the field when there are no acorns. Waiting for the acorns increases the pigs appetite for them, so when they finally fall to the ground, they gorge on them. This gorging forms the fat cap, i.e., the fat surrounding their muscles, for which Jamón Ibérico is so famous. But ham isn’t the only delicious food that the complex ecosystem produces. Merino sheep still graze the grass in the dehesa. And although they aren't traditionally a milking sheep, Merinos are milked to produce two of the world’s finest cheeses: Torta del Casar and La Serena.  The dehesa also houses geese which produce foie gras, or fatty goose liver. The geese roam freely and when they feel the winter chill approaching, they overeat, creating a naturally fatty liver. The complexity of the dehesa means that these products are a product of the entire land. Now let’s take a look at another complex system: the ocean. If industrialized farming on land wreaks havoc there, why not turn to the resources of our seas? Bad idea. We’ve already taken so much from our oceans that overfishing has reached critical levels. Over the past 60 years, fishing increased fourfold, from 19 million tons in 1950 to 87 million tons in 2005. Now, over 85 percent of the world’s fish are endangered. Just as WWI technology gave rise to monocultural agriculture, WWII wartime technology, like sonars, were used to increase fishing yields. Together with the practice of bottom trawling, this has almost emptied our oceans of fish. Bottom trawling also hauls out fish that are too small to use or otherwise unwanted. To make matters worse, eating fish high up in the food chain intensifies the problem. Many of the most sought-after fish, such as bluefin tuna, halibut and cod, are high on the food chain; they eat other fish and take longer to reach full maturity. However, people like Spanish chef Ángel Léon have come up with a more sustainable approach to fish consumption. At his restaurant, Léon makes good use of small fish and fish that are usually discarded, even using pureed fish eyes to thicken his sauces. Such thrifty ideas are better for our environment and have earned him the title of “Chef of the Sea.” Our monocultural grain farming also affects our waters. Many of the chemical fertilizers we use on our plants are never totally absorbed and flush into the sea. This saturates our oceans with nitrogen and other chemicals, making it impossible for plankton and other sea life, which other fish need to feed on, to survive. One example of this can be seen at the mouth of the Mississippi River, where an 80,000 square mile dead zone lies off the Gulf of Mexico. This was created by the fertilizers from the Midwest. Fish farming presents an alternative to fishing in oceans and rivers. But this is nothing new: China has been doing it since 500 BC. The annual growth in fish farming, which hovers around 8.8 percent, is just enough to keep pace with the global increase in fish consumption. Some even argue that, by 2018, all the fish we eat will have been farm-raised. While this doesn’t seem problematic at first sight, the environment is suffering for it. Most fish farms are situated on shorelines or estuaries. These are complex systems where saltwater meets river water. It’s also the most active part of the oceans, where fish spawn and breed. The problem is, a shoreline fish farm functions like a monoculture in that it undermines biodiversity. Farmed fish require food. Often, it’s other fish caught in the wild. To raise one pound of farmed fish, three to five pounds of wild fish are needed. It’s either that, or using grains from our seriously flawed agricultural system. But all’s not lost, though: fish can be farmed in a better way. Remember the dehesa? Well, the Spaniards have also come up with a different kind of fish farm: enter Veta la Palma. The land here was once drained by channels to make pasture for cattle, and these channels have been used to flood the system with estuary water to create fish farms. Merged with the water from the Guadalquivir river, it’s become an ideal breeding ground for the phytoplankton that shrimp feed on. These shrimp then become feed for the fish that are farmed there.  The canal fish farm also functions as a filter for the overfertilized water that runs off the farms and flows into the river. As a result, this natural mimic of a shoreline produces high-quality, natural-tasting fish. So, once again, we see how complex systems often mean a better environment for creating healthier and tastier foods. Whether it’s grains for animals or for human consumption, they exist thanks to seeds. Seeds hold the answer to our food future. And, as we know, being ready for the future requires learning from the past.  Let’s look back to the proliferation of hybrid plants, which created today’s monocultures. Hybrids are essentially two plants which are crossbred to create a new plant. The plus side of hybrids is that, for example, a corn plant can become more resistant to drought or a wheat plant can produce larger yields. Dwarf wheat, invented by Norman Borlag, was a revolutionary hybrid. After 15 years of experimenting with hybrids, in 1952, Borlag discovered a Japanese breed called Norin 10, which caught his attention due to its shortness. He went on to create hybrids of Norin 10 and other wheat types. When used with fertilizers, this breed produced three times the yield of normal wheat. Borlag’s hybrid was a huge success. By 1963, 95 percent of wheat in Mexico was of this variety. It also helped a famished India triple its wheat production and start exporting wheat. In a sense, this was fantastic progress. But it also had some serious side effects.  This kind of seed monoculture is the basis for the world’s monocultures. As we’ve seen, monocultures have grave impacts on our environment and our health. Some people argue that cases of certain types of cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular disease have increased due to these monocultures. The future of food, then, is to go back to collecting our own seeds. Rather than using hybrids, we should base our cuisine on several varieties of grains, vegetables, beans, etc. This is, after all, how cuisine was created: by using what the land has to offer and creating delicious dishes with it; not by every person in the world eating the same thing. We now understand that monocultures have a negative impact on our environment, our health and our cuisine. So what might sustainable cuisine look like? Let’s take a look at two dishes. First, the beloved risotto: a classic first course at many high-end restaurants. However, it’s also the quintessential monoculture dish of rice, stock and cheese. This could be tweaked by creating rotation risotto, combining different grains grown in rotation to replenish the soil. Rye could be used to infuse the soil with carbon, barley to suppress weeds, buckwheat to cleanse the soil of toxins and legumes to give the soil nitrogen. To get the perfect consistency, you could add a puree of brassicas, such as kale and broccoli. These brassicas have the added benefit of also providing the soil with nitrogen. This very dish is available on the menu at the author’s New York City restaurant Stone Hill. Next, let’s rethink a meat dish. How can we make the most of the meat we eat? The nose-to-tail method, where the whole animal is used, has been en vogue in many restaurants. But let’s take it one step further with the blood-to-bone method. With a view to creating a dehesa-like environment, the author introduced the Ossabaw pig breed to his Blue Hill farm. With similar characteristics to the Iberian pig, it helped shape the land. It also bred with other pigs on the farm, giving rise to a breed they call Crossabaws. The dish they make from these pigs consists of grilled meat to infuse extra flavor, and the pig bones are made into a charcoal that seasons the meat. To ensure nothing goes to waste, the blood of the pig is then used in a blood sausage to complete the dish. The key message in this book: The way we eat affects the way we produce our food, and vice versa. But the way we farm and produce food today is unsustainable. Still, there is hope. We are capable of growing, producing and cooking food that is better for our environment and tastes great, too. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

And it looks like it’ll only continue to permeate our lives in ever new ways. We are approaching the third wave of the internet revolution, a time when our use of information-age technology will change and enter a new stage. Let’s look at how we reached this third wave and what we can expect from it. We’ll explore the fields that’ll be revolutionized, how this may happen and what types of obstacles entrepreneurs will face in the new era. In these blinks, you’ll find out how the third wave will change the healthcare industry; what “impact investing” is and why it’s a key feature of the third wave; and that cooperation is sometimes more effective than competition. In 1980, futurist Alvin Toffler wrote The Third Wave, a book describing how the next “wave” of evolution in the information age would transform the world and create an electronic global village. But to understand this “third wave,” let’s first take a step back and look at what came before. The first wave began with the creation of the foundation and infrastructure of the online world. Companies like Sprint, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, AOL, and IBM created crucial hardware, software and networks, making the internet available to everyday users. This wasn’t exactly an easy task. These online pioneers faced an uphill battle, struggling to convince people that the internet was relevant and worthwhile. Indeed, many saw it as a fad. In a 1995 interview on PBS, the author was asked, “Why do people need [the internet]?” By the turn of the twenty-first century – the beginning of the second wave – the answer to that question was more than apparent. By this time, search engines like Google were helping people navigate ever vaster amounts of information; online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay appeared; and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter emerged, connecting more and more people. The second wave further revolutionized the world when mobile devices like Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android enabled people to access the internet wherever they went. This brings us to the third wave, on the threshold of which we currently stand. The third wave is about integrating the internet into everything we do. No longer limited to PCs, tablets and other devices, the internet is becoming part of our homes, automobiles, agriculture and cities. This technologically-integrated age has also been referred to as the Internet of Things. The third wave will find entrepreneurs taking advantage of this new era to challenge major industries such as healthcare, education, food and commuting. So, let’s dive in and discover what these future fields of entrepreneurship may look like. The third wave of the internet isn’t about creating the next viral game or social media app; it’s about innovatively addressing real-world problems. Consider health care, an industry that offers great potential for entrepreneurs. Health care is a huge market, making up one-sixth of the US economy, and since it suffers from longstanding problems, there’s plenty of room for technological improvement. The US healthcare system is notoriously slow, inefficient and expensive; many hospitals still use fax machines and hard copies of medical records, and, due to a lack of coordination and accessible data, mistakes are constantly being made. For instance, in 2011, researchers at the cancer center MD Anderson found that one out of every four patients was getting a new diagnosis following a second opinion. Many entrepreneurs have already jumped at this opportunity: between 2010 and 2014, the amount of money raised by digital health-care start-ups quadrupled. So, before long, smartphones will diagnose your symptoms, check your medical background and warn you before you have a stroke or heart attack. This constant monitoring of high-risk patients from home could potentially reduce health-care spending by 30 percent – money that would otherwise be drained into misdiagnoses and incorrect treatments. Another enormous opportunity for these entrepreneurs is the five-trillion-dollar food industry. The third wave will revolutionize how we grow, raise, store, transport and deliver food. For example, a report in The Guardian revealed that innovative researchers are already finding ways to improve bee colonies by connecting their hives to the internet. Bees are vital in the pollination of crops and their numbers are declining. But internet technology can monitor hive temperatures and create heat in order to deter the mites that lead to colony collapse. Entrepreneurs are also developing sensors to monitor food safety, even going so far as to imagine ovens that will refuse to cook spoiled meat! Such technology is badly needed in processing plants today, where USDA inspectors check less than one percent of processed meat. As we can see, the third wave represents a serious change to the old ways of doing business. In the wake of the third wave, ideas will continue to come from unexpected places, causing disruption that entrepreneurs should embrace. These ideas will lead to old paradigms being shifted or completely destroyed, which means success will only come to those who take risks and recognize future opportunities. The self-driving car is a perfect example of an innovative idea that emerged from a surprising place – in this case, the agricultural sector. Companies like Google and Uber are now embracing this technology, but it actually goes back 20 years, when the Illinois-based tractor company John Deere developed GPS navigation systems for self-driving tractors. Unfortunately, the John Deere executives didn’t see the true potential of their innovative idea. Even though it’s unlikely that John Deere would have had the means to build self-driving commercial cars from scratch, they ignored the opportunity to license the technology to a partner company or branch out into new territory. Had they been willing to take a chance and disrupt their business model for something new, who knows what level of success they would have achieved. In other cases, self-disruption might be the key to future success. This entails being aware of your customer’s current preferences and not being afraid to get rid of tried-and-true products or services in favor of new ones. Apple has done this multiple times. Some of their biggest successes have come at the expense of their previous products. Apple was not afraid to hurt iPod sales by coming out with the iPhone, or limit MacBook growth by releasing the iPad. Amazon is another expert at self-disruption. After building its reputation selling physical media, it successfully transitioned into streaming movies and TV shows, and introduced the Kindle for customers to buy and read electronic books. Successfully riding the third wave means getting out of your comfort zone and not underestimating how fast those tidal waves of change can come. But, as we’ll see in the next blink, staying on top also means looking beyond the profit margins. Historically speaking, corporations and CEOs have long adhered to economist Milton Friedman’s old dictum: “The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.” Investors have also been happy with this philosophy, but as the third wave rolls in, we’re seeing a change. There’s been an increase in impact investing, a third-wave megatrend that merges traditional business and philanthropy. Through impact investing, corporations recognize the importance of creating both financial return and social good. This results in a “best of both worlds” scenario where companies can combine profit and purpose. And this is what we see today; major institutions such as investment banks, asset management firms and private equity investors are all embracing impact investing. But this kind of practice is still in its early days: In 2013, global wealth reached over $150 trillion, but only $50 billion went toward impact investing. However, current projections suggest that by 2020, this amount will increase twenty-fold to exceed $1 trillion. This is mostly due to millennials, who are committed to creating positive social change, both as employees and consumers. This new generation wants to support companies that have a positive impact on society. And this trend has been supported by corporate policy-makers, too. In July of 2013, the G8 governments created the Social Impact Investment Taskforce to help foster a profitable, purpose-driven marketplace made up of benefit corporations, or B corporations. As a result, many US states have created laws to support such companies. These organizations include Patagonia, Kickstarter and Etsy, all of which are focused on issues like climate change, job creation and supporting the arts – in addition to making a profit. Kickstarter is a perfect example of a public-benefit company. Their mission statement is to use a global crowdfunding platform for the sole purpose of helping bring creative projects to life. For some time now, technology hubs like Silicon Valley, and creative business meccas like New York, have maintained the status quo when it comes to brilliant ideas. But this will change as the third wave engenders “the rise of the rest.” This rise in innovation will come from on-the-ground experts in diverse geographic regions. Removed from the usual insulated areas, their location will afford them direct access to the businesses they aim to affect and provide them with the kind of experience that brings about useful innovation. After all, it makes more sense for a new food company to operate out of the Midwestern United States, where there’s agricultural infrastructure, or for a health-care company to be based in Baltimore or Nashville, where you can find many medical institutes. Take Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins University. With its extensive research programs, it’s often considered one of the best medical schools in the world. So, it stands to reason that you’ll find a more innovative idea for your health-care business here than across the country in Silicon Valley. This rise of the rest will also create new opportunities and improve economic growth. This is because start-ups are the engine of America’s economy: over the past 30 years, new companies less than a year old have created an average of 1.5 million jobs per year. In fact, The Kauffman Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on entrepreneurship, found that new businesses like these are almost completely responsible for the overall increase in new jobs. There’s the Detroit-based Shinola, for example – a company that employs hundreds of former autoworkers to build such products as watches, bicycles and handbags. Their motto is “Where American is Made,” and they’ve found success exporting their goods around the world. Venture capitalists would be wise to start paying attention to what’s going on outside of the usual locations. But, as we’ll see in the next blink, these third-wave entrepreneurs won’t be revolutionizing the economy completely on their own. Second-wave companies, like Google and Amazon, managed to become overnight sensations by single-handedly creating massively popular products. While this method proved successful in the past, it won’t work in the third wave. Like companies during the first wave, innovative third-wave companies need to build strong partnerships with industry gatekeepers. Otherwise, these big corporations may regard new entrepreneurs as competition and block their path. So there are lessons to be learned from the first wave: When Apple was developing iTunes and the iPod, they needed to license music content that people could download. As a result, they needed to build partnerships with companies that might see Apple as a business threat. But at the time, iTunes was only a Macintosh program, and the computer only had a two-percent share of the market. This allowed Apple to pitch iTunes to the music corporations as a risk-free experiment, where they could safely test out online music sales. For Apple and the record labels, this was a win-win proposition. So, to follow this proven path to success, third-wave entrepreneurs will have to make early partnerships to build credibility and gain momentum in order to win over the gatekeepers. And to find the right partners, they will need to look in diverse places: For instance, when AOL was starting out, it hustled non-stop before finally landing a willing partner with the Commodore computer company. But they didn’t stop there – they kept the momentum going, with Commodore leading to a second partnership with Tandy, then a deal with Apple and finally a contract with IBM. So, even if you have a great product or a spectacular idea, you might never get them off the ground unless you make partnerships a core part of your strategy. Success in the third wave of the information age doesn’t only depend on finding like-minded business partners. Entrepreneurs will also need to work closely with the government. After all, the government has always played a crucial role in innovation. Government organizations routinely take risks by funding research, supporting projects and ideas that the private sector won’t or can’t touch. In fact, without federal assistance, many of today’s technologies wouldn’t exist. For example, the GPS technology in our cars and mobile devices is due to the Department of Defense, which created a satellite-based global positioning system as part of its nuclear deterrence program. But the best example might be the internet itself, which was created in 1972 as part of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a government agency created by President Eisenhower in 1958. The internet’s potential in private and commercial use only became apparent when the government passed the Telecommunications Act in 1996. Therefore, it’s important to understand that the government’s role will only become more crucial in the future, and in order to succeed you’ll have to work alongside it – mainly because third-wave entrepreneurs will be targeting highly regulated industries. Just think: Would you want to ride in self-driving cars that didn’t receive government approval? So, to ensure both short-term and long-term success, future innovators must work hand in hand with the government to make sure that they’re operating within the bounds of legislation. This kind of relationship can even help pave the way for future laws and policies. Certainly, it’s not uncommon to think of the government as a terrible tangle of bureaucracy and red tape. But if you have revolutionary ideas about changing the way we lend money, or the way we deliver government services, such as food or new forms of energy, the government must be a partner, not an adversary. The key message in this book: The Third Wave is the next phase of the internet and information age, and it is fast approaching. This next step in our technological evolution will be marked by businesses and entrepreneurs who possess strong partnerships, purpose-driven missions and a clear understanding of government policy.

If you knew the real number, you’d be shocked. Don’t feel bad though – you’re far from the only one. Since its advent, emailing has completely changed the way we communicate and has made life easier in countless different ways. But, as you’ll see in these blinks, all of this has come at a price. More and more people are feeling the side effects of never being more than a ping in the pocket away from total distraction. So, how do we overcome this tyranny of emails? In these blinks, you’ll learn what camels have to do with sending letters; what spamming looked like before the internet; and why you should only answer emails twice a day. Powerful groups of people have sought to control the flow of information throughout human history. For a long time, only governments and the Catholic Church had the tools to dispense information on a large scale. Empires and governments have been using communication as means to consolidate their power since antiquity. In the Persian Empire, for example, messages could be sent by horse at the speed of 100 miles per day – as early as 600 BC! A new horse had to be switched in along the route at every postal stop. The Abbasid Caliphate had over 900 postal stops in 860 AD, and Caliph Abu Jalbar Mansur once said in a speech that a faithful postmaster was just as important as the Chief of Police or the Minister of Finance. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Church issued major doctrinal rulings or political decisions by disseminating scrolls all across Europe. Common people, on the other hand, didn’t have access to long-distance communication until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, in in the year 1500 in Britain, only five to ten percent of the adult population could even read or write. Sending mail was very costly, too. For just one letter, you needed paper (which was expensive at the time), silk to wrap it in, wax to seal it and access to an official sign. Sending a letter over 400 miles cost about a fifth of the average daily wage as late as 1800. Things were further complicated by the fact that people didn’t have fixed addresses. An American woman once addressed a letter to her brother by writing, “To my most noble brother, Mr. John Miles Breton, at Ye barber shoppe which lieth in the land hard against ye tavern of Ye Great Square in shadow of Ye Towne Hall.” With addresses like that, it was often hard for letters to end up in the right place! Postcards quickly took off as a hot new form of communication after the first one was sent in 1871. Not everyone liked the change, however. In fact, The New York Times said the country was suffering from a postcard-sending “epidemic” later that same year! Letter writing, postcards and mail services became much more accessible to common people in the late 1800s, thanks in large part to education reform and massive literacy campaigns in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. Large governments also started investing more in their postal systems to build them up. The British Royal Mail, for example, employed 42,000 people and had opened over 12,000 offices by 1873. The US Congress even experimented with using camels to deliver mail from Texas to California. By that point, mail had gradually started to become a more regular part of people’s lives. In 1840, the average American only sent three letters a year; by 1900, that number had risen to 69. People used mail for various different purposes, too. Emigrant groups wrote letters to stay in touch with friends and relatives, and some people even started using it for fun. Members of the “Nonsense Correspondence Club”, founded in 1903, sent random items to each other, like leftovers from their dinner parties! Communication styles also changed as mail became more widely available. In 1871, The New York Times published a complaint about what we now call “flaming” when it happens online: aggressive, violent insults sent out to people anonymously. There were even early forms of spam! Some unlucky people got tricked into making false investments as early as 1887, when they received letters asking them to claim the estates of supposedly deceased distant relatives. Letters were becoming much easier to send at the turn of the century, but they still took a long time to get where they were going. Overall, communication was still fairly slow. But the telegraph changed that completely and irrevocably. The telegraph was an incredibly powerful communication tool – so powerful that it changed the way people perceived space and time. For the first time, people and information in far away places were quickly accessible. Before the transatlantic cable was laid in 1870, it took five weeks to send news from London to New York. With the cable, it only took a matter of hours. As the world grew smaller and communication became easier, even enemies started making long-distance small talk with each other. Generals in the American Civil War of 1860 sent each other short, provocative messages like, “I see your condition through my telescope” and “We have intercepted your supplies. Give in like a good fellow.” The introduction of the telegraph even brought on the first era of information overload. People now had unprecedented access to news and communication. In fact, the second message sent by Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph, was, “Have you any news?” William James, the famous philosopher, coined the term Americanitis to describe the perpetual fear of not being on time, and nervousness about missing out on something – all sorts of stress caused by the telegraph. Newspapers also started printing larger editions as the telegraph granted people more access to news. Soon they were printing every day instead of once a week, covering news from all over the world; but not everyone liked this development. The Michigan newspaper Alpeno Echo even shut down its telegraph service because it felt it was becoming the voice of the world, rather than the record of its community. The telegraph peaked around 1945, when about 240 million telegrams were sent per year. In 2007, the number of emails sent globally hit 35 trillion – a figure more than 10,000 times higher. So how did email become so successful and what does it mean for us? Email has made communication much easier and faster than ever before. Not only is it instantaneous, it also costs virtually nothing! Before email, people had to write addresses (or descriptions of a location!) on paper or envelopes and send them out individually. Now, we can send messages to people, or even large groups of people, with just one click. You can forward a message or share a piece of news without thinking about it at all. Email is also free. Anyone with a computer or phone and access to the internet can use it anytime, from any location. Telegrams, on the other hand, used to cost quite a lot. In 1860, it cost the equivalent of $18 in today’s money to send a message from New York to London. Communication has become a lot more efficient – but it might actually be too efficient. Now that it’s so easy to send and receive messages, we’re often expected to reply immediately. Online messages constantly interrupt our day. In fact, one 2006 study found that the average American worker was interrupted 11 times per hour, resulting in an overall loss of $600 billion. Another danger of constant email access is that it can create a never-ending to-do list for you. When you can receive new tasks or information at any second, your friends, family or boss might expect you to be available at all times, always ready to change your plans. It goes without saying that email is efficient. But it creates a lot of stress for us too. Email is a digital form of communication, but it still generates problems in the physical world. In fact, email functions a lot like a drug. Email is addictive and causes behavioral problems just like any other addiction. When you get a positive email, you feel a sense of validation and recognition. This, in turn, induces you to keep checking your inbox again and again so you can get that feeling over and over. The resulting addiction is powerful: in one survey designed to measure email response time, the average time was only 104 seconds. Seventy percent of the participants responded in just seven seconds. Email withdrawal can cause distress and anxiety, too. In 2007, one real estate agent even said that his “blood ran cold” when the Blackberry network went down for a few hours. Our brains simply aren’t designed for the new challenges presented by email. Brain imaging has proven that repetitive behavior, such as compulsive email-checking, causes imbalances in dopamine levels. Your dopamine increases when you check your email, so you start to crave it. Compulsive email-checking also has a negative effect on your memory. When you try to do too many tasks at once, your brain’s attention is directed away from your hippocampus, which is responsible for storing information. It focuses instead on your striatum, which deals with repetitive tasks. This is why it’s harder to remember what you were doing if you were multitasking. Emails also send very little information to our prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for empathizing with others and addressing them in an appropriate tone. So, they can generate a lot of misunderstanding. The prefrontal cortex is particularly vulnerable and impressionable during adolescence, so young people who develop email addictions may also develop permanent problems with communication. Our email habits have a major impact on our emotions and everyday behavior. They even change the way we interact with our families, friends and children! Why? Because email is a major disruption in our daily lives. The speed, frequency and anonymity of email can leave you feeling exhausted at the end of the day. Moreover, emails are depersonalized, draining and can diminish your sense of accomplishment. According to psychologist Christina Maslach, these are the symptoms of burnout. We’re also reading fewer books these days because of email, and our eye movements have changed; we’re now prone to skimming instead of reading. In fact, the percentage of adults scoring “proficient” on prose reading scores dropped considerably between 1992 and 2003. Email has an impact on our sleep patterns as well. Studies have shown that people are now sleeping less than they did 20 years ago, largely because of our need to always be connected. Our social lives and relationships have also suffered in the modern age. Madonna even admitted in 2008 that she and Guy Ritchie slept with their smartphones under their pillows, so they could grab them whenever they needed. “It’s not unromantic,” she said, “it’s practical.” The pair is now divorced. You also spend less time with your loved ones when you’re always looking at your phone or computer. Bruce Mehlman, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Technology Policy under George W. Bush, even claimed he could play with his son while checking his email. He always had to make bad trade-offs, however. He once destroyed his son’s Lego figure in a play fight so he could answer an email, leaving his son to rebuild the figure on his own. We’ve seen that email is highly addictive and alters our brains. Even so, it’s still possible for us to overcome this tyranny. Let’s go over some tips for controlling your email so it doesn’t end up controlling you. First off, you need to stay in control of when you’re actually using email. Try checking your email only a set number of times per day, or only using it during work hours. Figure out what amount of email is healthy and necessary, and cut out any excess use of it. In this way, you avoid unnecessary interruptions and can react to a long email thread without having to check every single message as it arrives. You make matters worse if you check your email just after you wake up or just before you go to sleep – it means you’re subjecting your mood to other people’s messages at key points in your day. So, aim to have a few email-free hours on either end. We also need to change the way we write our emails. Give your email an efficient subject line that summarizes the most important parts, and be sure to keep your emails short and only write information that’s absolutely necessary. Then, encourage others to do the same. Let them know you don’t always need a “Thank you message” and keep your inbox free of any messages that aren’t useful. Strive to find a balance between email and other, offline tools for planning and communication. Phone calls and meetings are better than email if you're discussing something sensitive. Group discussions should be held in person, as group emails can become endless and disorienting. Try rearranging your desk, too. Desks are usually organized around computers, but make sure you still have enough space to write on paper and make phone calls comfortably. Don't cut paper and pens out of your life! The key message in this book: No other form of communication has affected our lives as profoundly as email. It offers free, instant access to communication from anywhere with internet access. Though its benefits are manifold, email has its downsides too. It's addictive, hampers our attention span, causes us stress and is changing the nature of our relationships in some negative ways. Email is powerful, so make sure you control it – or else it will control you. Actionable advice: Use your voice when you need to discuss something lengthy and complicated. Nuances can be lost in emails, creating unintentional confusion or ill feelings. If you need to discuss something important, it's best to do it in person. If that isn’t an option, make a phone call – otherwise, emails might actually be counterproductive. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s a fascination with the past through retro fashions or historical fiction, or excitement about the future and whether or not we’ll be colonizing other planets, we think about the past and future more than we do about today. And of course, our preoccupation with the past and future has led to our desire for time travel. How fantastic would it be to take a trip back to ancient Rome or fast forward to an age of flying cars and interstellar travel? But is time travel possible and where did the concept come from? These blinks show you how the dream of journeying back and forth through time captured our imaginations. In these blinks, you’ll discover why cyberspace allows for time travel; why going back in time is theoretically possible; and why you time travel when you open a book. Nowadays, time travel is just about everywhere you look, from films to TV shows and even literature. And that’s no accident: society has become obsessed with the idea of traveling through time. However, that wasn’t true just 150 years ago. The portal was opened by H. G. Wells’ novel, The Time Machine, which was published in 1895. In The Time Machine, Wells describes a man, called simply the Time Traveler, who builds a machine that enables him to move throughout the course of history and into the future. The story is important because it approaches time as something flowing, that, with the appropriate vessel, could be sailed. Before this book came out, time was basically viewed as a one-way street. You could only go forward, and only at one speed. In this way, Wells’ fictional account transformed the way people viewed time and time travel. But why was it so successful? Largely because it came out at the end of the nineteenth century when tremendous change was in the air. As the twentieth century dawned, people were becoming incredibly excited for the future. It was a period of huge technological as well as scientific growth and, for the first time ever, people were living in a way that was dramatically different from the generation before them. In other words, it was the first time that the past, future and present would be entirely different. This simple historical moment is what made time travel so riveting. It’s important to remember that before this, the future was considered to be similar to the present. Stories regarding future events would often be based on prophecy, as in Oedipus Rex or Macbeth. Such tales of prophecy center on a personal journey that will happen to a particular character in the future. But they fail to envision a major change in how people generally live. The twentieth century, and H. G. Wells, changed all of that. So, when time travel emerged as a concept, it was all the rage. But as the topic underwent further discussion, ever greater theoretical problems came to light. For instance, can you travel forward in time to meet your future self? What if you went back in time and altered the course of events that led to your life? Because of these quandaries, rules had to be established for time travel. These strictures were rapidly worked out by writers and thinkers, with the majority of them published in pulp magazines. Just take the question of how to travel through time from 1895 to today without altering major events like the two World Wars. It was decided that time travel could occur so rapidly that you wouldn’t touch anything on your way. You’d simply glide through the decades unnoticed. Other theoretical problems focused on how the “self” would be changed as a result of time travel. If you met yourself in the future, would you be you? Or would you be an entirely different person? To handle this issue, the science fiction community decided that each self you encountered over the course of your time travel would be a different entity. So your self from 2010 would always be “2010 you” and your self from 2020 would always be distinct from him. Another even more abstract question in this debate formed around the question of free will. If you travel to the future and meet yourself, does that mean your life will necessarily lead to the two of you meeting? In other words, is your fate predetermined? Other questions arose, too. Time travel allows you to go back and correct past mistakes, like that chemistry test you bombed in high school. Does this make learning and effort irrelevant? By now you know how fiction helped build the idea of time travel, but some real scientific thinkers also shaped the concept. Albert Einstein was one who transformed the way other scientists approached time itself. His theory of special relativity proposed that the speed of light is a constant, no matter how quickly or in which direction you travel. This had incredible effects on the idea of time. Now, rather than moving at a constant, universal rate, time could be considered relative. In other words, the faster you travel, the slower time moves. By this logic, a person in a rocket moving at close to the speed of light would experience time more slowly than someone standing on the ground. Following Einstein’s breakthrough, science came up with a variety of other theories that impact the way we consider the passage of time. Just take the idea of multiverses. This concept proposes that there are an infinite number of parallel universes, each different from the next due to a series of small decisions taken. In other words, there’s a universe in which you decided to study for your test and one in which you didn’t. Since such scientific developments didn’t occur in a bubble; many of them influenced the philosophy of time as well. One such philosophical debate focuses on memory. The human memory is imperfect, and each time you remember something, you’re actually altering the story. In doing so, aren’t you, in fact, altering the past and the future? That’s to say, if you forget that you went out partying instead of studying, you’re actually transforming the way you consider your life and your future self. Isn’t that similar to the idea of multiverses? But naturally, most people struggle just with the idea of time as relative. For ordinary people, outside of science fiction, time really does move at the same speed and certainly in the same direction. Such a concrete experience makes it difficult to think of time as fluid. If you traveled back through time and murdered your own grandfather, would you disappear? Then again, if you never existed, how could you have killed your grandfather in the first place? Therein lies the most common paradox of time travel. But it certainly isn’t the only one. Most of these paradoxes result from traveling backward in time. The butterfly effect suggests that small events can have major repercussions down the line. If a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the planet, could the small gust it creates transform into a raging storm thousands of miles away? This concept is essential in considering time travel, as any time traveler would face countless moments in which she could dramatically alter future events, even through a nearly imperceptible action. If you went back in time and killed Hitler in his infancy, how different would the world be today? There likely would have been no World War II, no United Nations, no Cold War – and who knows what else would have changed? Any changes made by a time traveler could lead to dramatic results in the future course of history. Questions like these are so complex that they have even perplexed the world’s top mathematicians and physicists. Just take the Austrian logician Kurt Gödel. He thought time travel was mathematically possible and postulated that universes with closed timelike curves could exist. Such curves can be thought of as time loops that move continuously back into the past. By riding such a loop, you could theoretically travel through time. Science also opened up a whole new set of questions by allowing for changes in causation. In theoretical science, there’s no law to prevent causality from reversing directions. So somebody in the future can theoretically alter the past. But despite such theories, other academics, Stephen Hawking and Einstein among them, didn’t believe time travel could be a reality. According to Hawking, if it were possible, we would already be surrounded by time traveling tourists. So, you’ve got a good sense of the history by now, but what does time travel mean today? Now you know how time travel has thrown esteemed thinkers and academics throughout history for a loop. But if you stop and consider what exactly time travel could be, you’ll quickly see that humankind has actually been doing it since the beginning of history. That’s because time travel is possible through literature and memory. Each and every time you read something, you travel through time by reaching into the past and seeing what someone thought of the world back then. After all, when a writer puts words down on a page, she’s thinking about someone who will read them in the future, whether near or far. Of course, there’s also memory, which means that you can travel through time by remembering past events and altering them however you wish – every single day. Beyond that, due to the development of the internet and its prominence, the very idea of time has transformed, and time travel along with it. In cyberspace, you can halt time, go back into the past and plan for the future. Go back through your Facebook feed and alter the past by untagging friends, deleting photos and editing posts. You can even immortalize yourself in cyberspace as your social media accounts will likely exist long after you die. The most amazing thing is that all of this happens at lightning speed as communication on the web is practically instantaneous. And those aren’t the only ways time travel is different today. Since the first age of time travel in the late nineteenth century, the times people want to visit have changed. People in the past primarily wished to travel to the future, but nowadays we also want to return to the past. Much contemporary culture is focused on retro styles. Even futuristic movies and TV shows like Back to the Future and Westworld are centered on narratives of returning to the good ol’ days; not plunging forward into the unknown. The key message in this book: Time travel is a popular, mind-boggling concept that has captivated humans for over a century. Today time travel is a commonly accepted idea, but one bound by complex considerations, internal laws and theoretical impossibilities. Got feedback?

Sort of nod your head, but hope you don’t have to say anything? Wonder if you should find out what it actually means? Or brush it off as “just another buzzword”? Well, we should all be taking Big Data seriously. As Phil Simon argues in Too Big To Ignore, not only is Big Data too big, it’s too important to overlook or shrug off. These blinks show why Big Data is suddenly relevant, and how you can use it to your advantage. That’s why this pack is a must-read. If you want to improve your business or organization, you need to make Big Data work for you. After reading these blinks, you’ll know how you can steer your business toward Big Data; how to visualize Big Data; and how companies like Netflix used Big Data to fuel enormous growth. Everyone’s talking about Big Data these days, and many companies hire data scientists. But what exactly is Big Data? And why is it spreading now? “Big Data” refers to huge data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with easily. They can’t be processed using basic applications like Microsoft Excel or Access. The growth of Big Data has been driven by our changing consumption patterns. Smart phones, cloud computing and broadband connections ensure that we’re constantly consuming and generating data. This new, fast and simple access to data ensures that we’re always “on.” Think about it – what’s the first thing you do when your plane lands? Turn on your phone, right? After that, you probably check your email, Facebook or Twitter. When you do that, you aren’t just accessing data – you’re creating it. This kind of consumer behavior created Big Data. Our consumption patterns have changed because of plummeting technology costs. Technology – especially storage and bandwidth – has become extremely cheap. This change really can’t be understated. Modern, inexpensive technology enables and even encourages us to contribute to Big Data. How many TV series would you stream if each episode cost $10 of bandwidth, on top of rental or purchasing fees? In 1990, data storage cost $10,000 per GB. By 2010, that figure had fallen to ten cents. Affordable technology and Big Data allow for 48 hours of video to be uploaded to YouTube every minute. It allows over 200 billion videos to be viewed each month. Without Big Data, such things wouldn’t be possible. So what are we supposed to do with it? So what makes Big Data any different from, say, data collected in the 1950s? Well, it’s not just that the quantity. The kind of data we collect has changed as well. Most Big Data is unstructured. Previously, data was relational, meaning it was much simpler and could easily be read on tables. Just think of a chart with customers in one column, and the products they’ve ordered in another. Unstructured data, on the other hand, is very messy. It can’t be organized the same way. Each tweet about your product is a piece of data, but you can’t just put tweets into a table. Why? Because tweets don’t have just one relation to another thing. Imagine if someone tweeted that they were considering your product. That tweet could contain a lot of data, like the person’s age, hobbies, demographic, education, or more. So you simply can’t make a table with “Tweet #1” and all its characteristics in columns – it would be unmanageably huge. Now imagine trying to do that with thousands and thousands of tweets! It would be impossible. This is what makes the data “unstructured.” Unstructured data accounts for more than 80 percent of organizational data today. If we can learn to manage unstructured data, we stand to gain great insights into consumer behavior. Unstructured data is actually a huge opportunity. Netflix is a perfect example of this. They keep track of where, when and how many times their movies are watched. They also track which devices their users watch them on, and they monitor people’s comments about the company on Facebook and Twitter. In the summer of 2011, Netflix lost 800,000 customers. When they evaluated how their services were being discussed on social media, they realized a lot of customers had been driven away when their mail service, Qwikster, rebranded and repriced their DVDs. So they got rid of Qwikster, and their business recovered. So even if you organize your unstructured data, how do you evaluate it? How can you learn something from millions of pieces of information? There are two main approaches here. The first, time series analysis, examines data over time. It’s easy to predict that sales will rise around Black Friday, for example, but a time series analysis can offer much deeper insight. It can show you how your sales change in relation to the customers’ payday dates – usually the 1st and 15th of each month. It also differentiates between long-term and seasonal trends. A time series analysis can also account for irregular sales fluctuations that exist outside trends – say if someone wins the lottery and lets their friends go on shopping binges. When you can make sense of your data, you’ll be able to ensure you don’t build strategies around temporary fluctuations. You won’t increase your inventory just because a lottery winner went on a one-time shopping spree in your store. The second approach, heat maps, help you visualize a large amount of data very easily. A heat map represents values with different colors, which can show you a lot more than traditional methods of displaying data. A table with 100 million entries certainly won’t illuminate much, and graphs technically can reveal more, but they only show the relationship between two variables. Heat maps, on the other hand, provide an overview of several variables at once. They can assess the amount, content and location of books sold, for instance. They’re also much more intuitive to read. You can detect trends by the intensity of colors in the heat map. Lots of red in one area might indicate that sales are high in a particular neighborhood in summer, for instance. Here’s some news that’s both good and bad: with Big Data, you’ll never use Excel or Access again. You’ll have to use new platforms if you want to get the most out of Big Data, and the platforms have to be versatile. Hadoop, for example, is a large collection of projects that handle data. It doesn’t have one standard configuration. Instead, it’s made up of several subprojects that are each quite complex. The precise workings of Hadoop are very technical, but it’s essentially a tool for breaking down Big Data tasks into smaller subtasks. Those subtasks are then processed individually, and put into new data sets. Facebook uses Hadoop to analyze huge swaths of user data. If you don’t want to spend the money on Big Data hardware and maintenance, you can also outsource it to a tech company.  If you want, you can test the waters by letting another company run your Big Data calculations and see if they prove profitable. Kaggle, an online start-up, was developed for this very purpose. Kaggle allows you to post Big Data tasks online, and find data scientists who can solve it. Even if you don’t know what you want to do with your data, Kaggle users can suggest ways it can be used. Kaggle users were once given flight and weather data, and asked to predict runway and gate times for airplanes. They had to help the flight schedule adapt to changing conditions. The winner’s analysis was 40 percent more accurate than industry standards. Ultimately, you have to find your company’s own best way of managing Big Data. Always ask yourself if what you’re doing is best for you. Even if you feel ready to jump into working with Big Data, you still need to pause. You’ve got to make sure your company is ready, too. Collecting and using Big Data will cost you, although some tools are free. Hadoop is freely available, but you’ll still need a considerable budget for consulting and training, to ensure that your Big Data investment is worthwhile. Don’t think of Big Data as a new program that just yields results when you install it. You have to restructure your approach to technology and data in general. Explorys, a company that uses Big Data to improve health care, learned this when they started work. They had to introduce grids for data storage, and develop a platform that worked across different health care providers. They also had to build a new team of over 100 employees. And even if you get great Big Data tools, remember that they can only help you if you’ve got good data. Even the best tools are useless if you aren’t gathering useful information. So start by asking specific questions, and outlining some short and long-term goals. You have to know precisely what information you want, or you won’t be able to figure out where to get it. Ask what consumer patterns make certain products successful, for instance, or what makes customers drop your brand. Then, collect as much data as you can on current and former customers. Eventually, you’ll be able to use this information to predict which products will sell well. You’ll also know when customers are about to leave you, so you can try to win them back. Big Data is not without its problems. If you think that storing a tremendous amount of information about people sounds like it has some drawbacks, you’re not wrong. Big Data raises privacy issues to new heights. If the wrong people get hold of certain kinds of Big Data, it could be disastrous. Apple and Amazon, for instance, are both reported to have around 400 million customer credit cards on file. Think about what that could mean for hackers or other data pirates. Even if we assume these companies can be trusted with our data (which is not necessarily a sound assumption), there have been many cases of data theft. So companies have to protect their customers’ data in addition to their own internal data. In 2012, Google got into some hot water when it was revealed that their Street View software had been gathering data from open Wi-Fi networks. This is the downside of Big Data: it can threaten our privacy. Major companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook can exploit user data endlessly if they choose. If this bothers you, you can consider using alternative services like DuckDuckGo – a search engine that doesn’t save any user data. So what’s the future of Big Data? Some people overlook the effect it will have on the consumer market. For one, we’ll see a slow move from active to passive data. Currently, most of our data is actively created. That means we use the internet through our laptops or smartphones, and create our data ourselves. But increasingly, data will be passively generated. We’ll have cars, TVs and other devices that will connect to the internet and track our behavior. These technologies will create data on their own. This may seem like an invasion of privacy, of course. It also means, however, that our technology will adapt itself to our specific behaviors. In the future, technology will be able to use data more effectively. Tony Fadell, the designer of the iPod, developed a program for his new firm, Nest, that’s an example of this. One of Nest’s devices is a thermostat that collects user data to “learn” people’s personal preferences and control their central heating accordingly. You don’t have to program Nest after it “learns” you – it uses your data to adjust the temperature. It might know, for instance, that you like your living room colder in the day and your bedroom warmer at night. The more you use it, the more it adapts to you. This data, in turn, is collected and sent online. This means you can control your heating with your smartphone, and see records of your temperature preferences. Clearly, Big Data is going to have a huge impact on our technology, environment and lives. Will you be a part of it? The key message in this book: Big Data demands a new way of thinking, new tools and a fresh approach to data analysis in general. However, if you can manage your unstructured data, your company stands to benefit tremendously. Big Data will only play a bigger role in our future, so don’t miss out! Actionable advice: Test the waters. Feeling iffy about jumping into Big Data? You don’t have to! Ask a Big Data company like Kaggle to run some analysis for you. You’ll get some insight, and find out if you’re ready for it. Don’t rush into things – take it slowly, and make sure you’re prepared.

Casting an eye forward, the book also outlines the future implications for a big-data society in terms of the risks, opportunities and legal implications.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Arkin","summary":"We’ve seen a great deal of debate about how to balance security and personal freedoms since 9/11 – and it’s only increased in recent years. Following the attacks on the Twin Towers, the American government greatly increased the powers of its security agencies, ostensibly to protect people from future attacks. However, instead of benefiting the public, these security agencies drained money, abused their power, and began to erode people’s personal freedoms. Top Secret America is alive and well, and it’s harmful not only to American citizens, but to the United States’ international image and relations. In these blinks, you’ll learn about Top Secret America and the dangers it poses. You’ll also learn why you can be arrested for driving too quickly near the White House; why security agencies are so terribly disorganized; what a “lone wolf” terrorist is, and why the hunt for them has been harmful; why secrecy is no longer relevant in modern society; and why shifting to a policy of openness would lead to greater safety and prosperity. Do you trust your government? In recent years, an increasing number of Americans have begun questioning the power and actions of their politicians and civil servants. This is largely because many government activities are now taking place in secret, rather than in the public sphere. The authors of this book call this hidden area of the government “Top Secret America.” Secret agencies, such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) have grown immensely in recent years. This is supposedly a response to new threats to the nation, most notably from post-9/11 terrorism. In an attempt to fight such threats, these secret agencies have lost a great deal of accountability and visibility in government. Citizens are unable to track what they get up to. Why is this? Well, when the security sector began to grow, it grew without supervision. Many of the documents used by security agencies are classified as top secret, meaning that most outsiders can’t access them. Even those who can access these documents find it hard to make sense of them. Top secret documents can only be read in secure reading rooms, where note-taking is forbidden. Moreover, readers aren’t allowed to consult experts like lawyers or academics for help in understanding them. Two super-users – people who are able to access the documents – told the authors that there simply isn’t enough time in one human life to thoroughly go through all of them. Clearly, there is little adequate supervision of what secret agencies are doing. For the most part, they are allowed to do whatever they please, and this has had serious consequences. Did you know you can be arrested for driving too quickly near the White House? Authorities view this act as a potential terrorist attack, rather than a mere speeding offense. This sort of thinking is the result of authorities expanding their power to prevent further strikes by terrorists. After 9/11, the Patriot Act of October 2001 eroded the separation between criminal cases and intelligence investigations. Traditionally, if the government wanted to arrest someone suspected of a crime, they needed a proper degree of evidence, and they had to follow strict procedures. However, they aren’t bound to such clear rules in an intelligence investigation. The blurring of the line between criminal cases and intelligence investigations thus weakened the rights of suspects. For example, before 9/11, certain laws ensured that people could know what personal data the government collected on them. After 9/11, these laws were stripped, or abandoned altogether. Authorities were terrified of missing potential terrorist threats, partly because many people believed that greater security could’ve prevented the original attacks. In fact, Mohammed Atta, a leader of the 9/11 plot, was stopped twice before the hijackings. An arrest warrant was even issued for him, but the officers who stopped him the second time weren’t aware of it. To avoid future situations like this, authorities started connecting many ordinary crimes with terrorism. For instance, in preparation for President Obama’s inauguration, regular crimes in the capitol region were seen as having potential links to terrorism. During that time, crimes in the area were investigated by the FBI rather than the police, just to be safe. When regular crimes became more associated with terrorism, ordinary people entered the surveillance lists of the FBI and other agencies. This allowed a culture of surveillance and control to spread. If you live in a Western society, you’ve probably seen posters telling you to watch out for suspicious behavior. That’s because security agencies need help from the public to keep them informed about potential dangers. Security agencies rely on citizens remaining vigilant in the face of threats, and they spend a great deal of money on sophisticated technologies to ensure this. For example, the city of Memphis paid a huge amount for license plate readers and secret cameras. But even with this sort of technology, authorities still need the public to notify them about potential danger. To encourage this, they have to make sure people are constantly reminded of the possibility of threats. The government thus plays up the danger through posters, press conferences and media reports on terrorism. Authorities also began to introduce technology developed for warfare into the public sphere. There was an increase in biometric identification such as iris scanners or body-heat detectors, for example. These technologies were originally developed to locate and kill terrorists, but now they’re being used on regular citizens. This technology was implemented partly to connect different sets of data. Police officers in Memphis, for instance, feed all their information into a coordinating office called the Real Time Crime Center (RTCC). The RTCC allows the entire police force to view all available data in real time. Analysts can use this to decide which areas need a greater police presence, and redistribute the police throughout the city. Police officers on the street can also use the RTCC to instantly access entire files about the owner of a car just by scanning their license plate. This new culture of surveillance is about more than just an increase in control – it’s also a big business, and it’s grown enormously since 9/11. The recent expansion of government surveillance has created many lucrative jobs. To get a job in an agency of Top Secret America, you first need top secret security clearance. That can be difficult, but if you manage to get one, it’s a guaranteed ticket to prosperity. A person with top secret clearance will have a high salary and great job security, even in difficult economic times. Private agencies also seek out clearances, and benefit greatly when they attain one. For example, after 9/11, nearly all security agencies sought a Sensitive Compartment Information Facility (SCIF), which was their equivalent of a top secret clearance. Security agencies needed a SCIF to perform many secret activities, and thus earn more money. The privatization of security services also became very profitable. After 9/11, many agencies in Top Secret America were privatized by the government to save costs. So if the government needs a translator, for instance, it won’t create a government post to fulfill the job. Instead, it’ll go to one of the 56 private firms that offers translation services. This has provided many new opportunities for private companies, but it hasn’t been beneficial in the way the government hoped it would. A study in 2008 illustrated this. It showed that contractors made up 28 percent of the workforce of intelligence agencies, but cost the equivalent of 49 percent of their personnel budgets. So although the government hoped to save money through this sort of outsourcing, it’s actually ended up costing more. Top Secret America isn’t just about secrecy and control – it’s also a new economy. Many people have founded their careers in this sector, but unfortunately, this has had some consequences. Many people imagine that modern intelligence gathering involves supercomputers that sift through information, without any need for human involvement. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case – humans remain at the heart of the security system. This poses a problem for the government: every human involved in a security agency is a potential security risk. Therefore their role has to be as limited as possible. To this end, authorities limit the amount of information that each person in the security system can see. For example, a person in one agency probably has very little access to the work of their colleague in another department. This disorganization means that very few people have access to an overview of the entire system. Essentially, one hand doesn’t know what the other is doing. The rapid expansion of Top Secret America further complicates this issue. As more people are hired, the percentage of inexperienced staff members increases. Overall, this leaves us with a rather inefficient system. Even those working for Top Secret America often suffer as a result. They often lose important parts of their private life, for instance. Employees of Top Secret America are constantly monitored to prevent abuse of the system. Lie detectors are widely used, but they aren’t always effective, so other machines that measure eyeball movements or voice stress have also been developed. The authors of this book spoke to a woman named Jeanie Burns, who is a businesswoman married to an intelligence officer. She has no idea what her husband does specifically, and he’s under immense pressure to remain silent about his work. When she told the authors her story in a bar, she was very afraid that counterintelligence services might be spying on the conversation. Human beings like Jeanie Burns’ husband are the core of Top Secret America, but they’re also its Achilles’ heel. After the 9/11 attacks, the American government quickly began to pour massive amounts of money into its intelligence and security agencies. Sometimes different agencies such as the Army or CIA were simultaneously given hefty resources to collect intelligence or provide security in the exact same areas. This obviously led to redundancy and wasted resources. Unfortunately, any attempts to make things run more efficiently were undermined by the     agencies themselves.     Agencies often didn’t allow their members to share information, fearing leaks or other dangers. For example, the CIA was so afraid of compromising its informants in Afghanistan and Iraq that it preferred to risk them being captured or killed, rather than share their names with even the highest military officers. The disorganization of Top Secret America also created confusion as to who exactly had authority over everything. At planning conferences or meetings, the number of attendees grew as the agencies grew. This resulted in increasingly inefficient, bloated gatherings where nothing truly got decided.     The lack of shared information between agencies made these meetings even more inefficient. Meetings were very difficult to conduct if each person only knew snippets of information. In an attempt to address these problems, the post of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created. The DNI coordinates all agencies and departments that make up the intelligence community. He or she also acts as the principal adviser to the president. However, the DNI still can’t solve all the intelligence problems created by disorganization. The DNI can track the security agencies, but they lack the authority to make them act in a coordinated manner. Overall, there are still a great deal of problems in Top Secret America. The threats facing the United States change all the time. There are long-term threats from groups like al-Qaeda, but also new dangers both at home and abroad. One strategy alone couldn’t possibly manage all of these threats, so the government must constantly weigh which threats should be tackled at which times. For example, in recent years, the Obama administration has shifted away from focusing on sleepers, to lone wolves. Sleepers are groups of foreign terrorists who’ve supposedly infiltrated American society, and are waiting for a sign to attack. Lone wolves are domestic terrorists who operate alone, outside any cells. Lone wolves are difficult to spot. How can you tell an ordinary citizen from one who might commit terrorism? In an attempt to sort the sheep from the wolves, the government has increased security measures that target the public, such as license plate detectors. However, it’s not easy to decide which strategy to follow. Security agencies must constantly weigh various costs and benefits against each other. Unfortunately, this decision-making process isn’t conducted in public. This means that unethical and potentially dangerous intelligence activities can go on uncontested. Concentrating on lone wolves, for instance, has led to the expansion of domestic security services. As a result, the government has more power over American citizens. Previously, only people who worked directly for the federal government could get security clearance to spy on citizens, but now investigators at state level can do so as well. There has been very little debate about this increase in domestic security measures, and little chance for people to even learn about it. The intelligence community’s new focus on lone wolves has been wracked with redundancy and inefficiency. However, the fact that lone wolves are so difficult to find is often used to justify this focus. Most people think of the Cold War as a very scary and dangerous time. To some extent, this was true, as there was always the threat of nuclear war. But at least people knew where that threat came from, and what form it was likely to take. When you know what threat you face, it’s much easier to develop effective counter threats. In the Cold War, the counter threat was Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) – if they blew you up, you’d blow them up. The situation is quite different now. The threat of terrorism comes from many places, and it can take many forms. This is problematic for security. The main problem is that security agencies can never be 100 percent sure there’s no threat. There’s always a chance that they might’ve missed something somewhere. Thus the government has to maintain the mindset of “you never know.” Everything that could possibly pose a threat must be investigated. This culture of perpetually increasing security measures has led to the misuse of authority and the abuse of liberty. After 9/11, several security agencies took actions that would’ve previously been considered unacceptable. For example, in order to force insurgents to turn themselves in, some Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) troops detained their mothers, wives and daughters. They treated them like hostages rather than suspects. Some interrogators only gave bread and water to them, and they took their clothes and didn’t allow them to sleep. Their motto was “no blood, no foul.” The way that crimes are classified has also changed. Some security agencies rebranded certain civil crimes as “acts of war.” That meant they could treat suspects more harshly, as they weren’t bound to civil codes of conduct. Top Secret America was developed through faulty logic and poor argumentation. It then spread rapidly, infiltrating more and more areas. There is an urgent need for change. Secrecy and lack of accountability in Top Secret America has raised many questions about the loss of liberty. But there’s also another question: is it even possible to keep such large amounts of information secret? Security agencies are struggling to stay ahead of those who want to access their data banks, such as hackers, foreign security officials or terrorists. Internal investigations have shown that most federal agencies have little understanding of how to protect their sensitive information. Employees are often unaware of where attacks and leaks might come from, or what they can do to stop them. The dramatic growth of Top Secret America has made this even more problematic, as information is now being collected at unprecedented rates. Security agencies are struggling to cope. Because it’s not possible to manage so much secret information, the American government should instead try to embrace openness. Foreign policy, for example, is an important area where this could be implemented. If foreign policy relationships were based on openness, the authors believe that 99 percent of currently secret information wouldn’t need to be kept secret at all. An open approach would also strengthen people’s belief in the security system, and allow it to work more effectively. The current security system is endangered by it’s own actions in Top Secret America. Only a fundamental policy change can lead to greater world-wide trust and lasting safety from terrorism. A change in security policy is definitely possible, and it could be immensely beneficial. If the American government moves toward being more open, it will also improve the image of the United States, both at home and abroad. After 9/11, secrecy became the core of American security. But rather than increasing safety, Top Secret America has proved to be dangerous, and a threat to democracy, personal rights and freedom. The concept of “Top Secret” doesn’t work in our present society. Firstly, it’s no longer possible for one secret to cause grave harm. This was true in the past, for example, if another country stole the procedure for making an atomic bomb. Today’s world is much more interconnected – states are now far more willing and able to help each other. Stolen Secrets in one state or area cannot be used anymore to bring down entire societies. The desire to keep things top secret is also harmful to society. The fear and panic it incited led to things like the depiction of Muslims as cartoonish villains, which harmed foreign relations. The reliance on secrecy also allowed officials to hide their own wrongdoings, and to chip away at democracy. Unfortunately, things don’t appear be changing at the moment. No serious threats actually appeared after 9/11, and the worst fears went unrealized. Despite this, the security system continued to grow. The Obama administration did initially vow to change the security system – first by closing Guantanamo. Despite these promises, and the general safety of the country, the base remained open. Instead, the Obama administration initiated even more leak investigations. They passed new laws, such as Cardin's Law, which made it a felony to disclose classified information to an unauthorized person. This had serious implications for journalists. If Cardin’s Law had been passed earlier, the public might never have learned about Guantanamo or the Abu Ghraib prison abuse. Top Secret America has endangered personal rights, and even democracy itself. It’s imperative that we dismantle it, to ensure the liberty and safety of the United States and the world. The key message in this book: National security is vital, but it can’t be based on secrecy. The current security state is redundant, inefficient and a grave waste of resources. Though it’s a big task to undertake, we must dismantle the powers of Top Secret America. Doing so will not only lead to greater freedom, but more permanent security as well. Suggested further reading: No Place to Hide by Glenn Greenwald No Place to Hide details the surveillance activities of secret agencies as according to information leaked by American whistleblower Edward Snowden. Rather than serving as a means to avoid terrorist attacks, as the US National Security Agency (NSA) claims, Greenwald explains that these dubious activities instead seem to be a guise for both economic espionage and spying on the general public. No Place to Hide also brings to light the media’s lack of freedom in detailing certain government and intelligence agency activities, and addresses the consequences whistleblowers face for revealing secret information.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

And the best way to ensure customer happiness is to give people a user experience, or UX. In the digital age, UX design is crucial. It determines how easy an app or site is to use and how well it aligns with customers’ wishes and demands. Despite its obvious invaluableness, however, UX design still isn’t at the core of most companies’ business strategies. These blinks will show you how to weave together strategy and UX design, creating a UX strategy. You’ll also find out what the four key elements in UX strategy are; why provisional personas are a great tool for trying your ideas out; and how to use storyboards to visualize the user experience. Imagine a tiny start-up with an awesome aspiration: they want to build a platform to connect reputable drug rehabilitation centers with addicts in need of treatment. To realize their dream, they make a database of facilities with empty beds, prioritizing those of higher quality, and make a website as well as an app for future users. Despite following this solid plan, however, nobody signs up. The company has a sneaking suspicion that their failure might have to do with their UX design and begins redesigning the look and feel of their app. But their work avails them nothing; people still aren’t interested. So what’s going on? Well, the UX design is a part of the problem, but the real issue is that it isn’t in sync with their business strategy. This is where UX strategy comes in. UX strategy requires that you take a big-picture view and consider whether your user experience fits your overall business plan. The first question here is whether the product you’re offering is actually desirable to your users. That’s why, rather than assuming that your future users will want what you’re selling, it’s important to gather evidence of a demand way before you even get to your UX. After all, it might make more sense to revamp your business strategy and reconsider the products and services you’ll be selling to users before considering their experience of your app. In other words, you should begin with your business strategy and then design a UX that fits it. But how? By following the straightforward plan laid out in the next blinks, you’ll learn how to break down UX strategy into its four central elements: business strategy, value innovation, validated user research and state of the art design. So a solid approach to UX begins with your business strategy. But why, exactly? Your business strategy is your company’s DNA; it guides every decision your company makes. For instance, the famous business theorist and practitioner Michael Porter says that, for a business to be viable, it simply needs to have a competitive advantage over the competition. Without this, it’s impossible to guarantee a business will continue to exist. There are basically two ways to achieve this advantage: The first is called differentiation – offering a product, or aspect of a product, that’s different from the competition and for which customers are willing to pay more. This concept explains why Starbucks can charge more for a latte than can your run-of-the-mill cafe. The difference is, quite simply, that the experience of Starbucks is different. Twitter is another good example of differentiation. Before the company started out in 2006, there was no way for people to broadcast information in such a short form. Now, instead of checking news outlets, users can get all the information they need in 140 characters. The second way to achieve a competitive advantage is through cost-leadership. In other words, by making your product cheaper. Walmart is the prime example of this tactic. This mega retailer has stayed in the game simply by selling products at a price point well below what the competition can manage. But of course, the best-case scenario is a product that combines both differentiation and cost-leadership. The result of this synergy is called value innovation, and it’s the key to jumping way ahead of your competitors. To get there, you need to create a product with no pre-existing competition that’s also super cheap. By so doing, you’ll enter what’s called a blue ocean market – a market devoid of competition, with a vast horizon toward which you can expand. Just consider Facebook. The product is free, and nothing like it existed before it came on the scene. Its innovations were groundbreaking. Before Facebook, there was no easy way to find people you know, message them and share media. The old world of business was one of trial and error; sometimes ideas worked out and sometimes they went belly up. The only way people learned in this context was through painful failure. But today there are other options. Now business people can remove the risk from their ideas, while reducing the costs incurred in the event of failure. They do this by verifying products through user testing. In other words, rather than assuming you have a great idea that will solve your customer’s problems, why not just put it into action and see what happens? People often have great ideas that don’t correspond to the desires of the market, and by testing these ideas on a selection of users and gathering feedback in the process, one can fine tune them so they fit market demand. From there, a revised product can be rolled out, its success can be measured and further feedback can be incorporated. Just take Facebook. When Mark Zuckerberg launched his product in 2004, he didn’t make it available to the whole world. Instead, he tested it within the confines of Harvard University. After this soft launch, he and his team improved the product’s features based on the information they gathered. For instance, they included new emojis and added a call feature. It’s just one example of how ironing out your product through testing can produce great results. However, even an incredible product will fail without awesome UX design. After all, UX is what a customer feels when she uses your app or website. The best user experiences fully engage customers, making them love your product. Airbnb is a great example. The interface of this vacation-rental platform is incredibly straightforward. It gives users the option to search using a number of self-explanatory filters, including price and apartment type, while also incorporating a map function that situates users in the city they’re traveling to. By focusing on UX design, Airbnb achieved the overall goal of all good UX: to acquire and bind customers through a captivating experience. Imagine you’ve got an idea for an app that helps engaged couples plan their wedding. With your product, they can select everything, from a location to entertainment to hors d’oeuvres. The idea is great, but who are these soon-to-be-married couples? A great way to answer this essential question is to form provisional personas – tools to help you define your value proposition. More specifically, a provisional persona is a sketch, created by you or your team, of a potential user. First, choose a name for your persona and assign him a picture. Then list his level of education, age, salary, job and any other relevant pieces of information. From there you can detail his behavior: What devices does he use? Does he have much free time? What does he value? And finally, lay out his needs and goals by asking yourself two questions: What is he trying to achieve and what motivates him? For instance, he might need information about wedding planning in an efficient form because he doesn’t have time for web searches. But of course this is all hypothetical and you shouldn’t assume anything about your future users. Rather, you should also collect real data about them by interviewing users in the real world. This process is all about testing your assumptions against the facts by conducting a variety of mini experiments. Your value proposition and the provisional personas you’ve created are your hypotheses. Now test those hypotheses by asking real people the same questions you asked your provisional personas. For instance, you could go to a mall and interview men with kids. There’s a decent chance that these men are recently married and have definite ideas about the wedding-planning process. Here are some questions you might ask: Was it difficult to find a good venue? What tools did you use? Why? After conducting such interviews, the next step is to evaluate the results. For example, if you interviewed ten people and eight of them said that a centralized platform would have been helpful when planning their wedding, you’ll have facts to support your idea. The best athletes review hours and hours of footage of their rivals to better understand the competition’s moves and prepare for a match. Similarly, it’s essential for you to observe your competitors to learn how they solve their problems. After all, understanding how other companies have succeeded or failed will help you build your competitive advantage. This process is a little bit like peeling an onion; the more layers you peel away, the closer you get to the core of what you want. And as you peel, you may realize that your ideas aren’t completely original. While such realizations can be unpleasant, they’re absolutely essential to finding out what truly does set you apart. After all, discovering this special something is your ticket to the blue ocean of untapped market potential. In the case of the wedding planning app, you might search for existing online services that organize weddings. For starters, you could research how much they cost and what they offer. From there, you could take a closer look at when they were created and how they are funded. This information, as well as much more, can be found on sites like techcrunch.com. Next, ask yourself how these companies make money. Is it through advertising, like on Facebook? Or through a subscriber plan? And finally, look at how much traffic they get by using free services like compete.com, Alexa or Quantcast. For mobile apps, you can use App Annie or Mopapp. Once you’ve gathered all this information, you can throw it in a spreadsheet and begin analyzing your data. For instance, you can sort the traffic column from highest to lowest and see which sites perform the best. You can also break your competition down into two categories, direct competitors and indirect competitors. Direct competitors target exactly the same customer segment as you and deliver the same or a similar product. Indirect competitors, on the other hand, have either a similar product but a different target audience or the same audience and a different product. Everybody has heard the old adage “less is more.” Well, it should come as no surprise that it applies to the development of stellar digital products as well. After all, to truly succeed, a product should focus on the experiences that are absolutely essential for users. To define these, you can think about which aspects of your product differentiate it from the competition. In other words, where does your competitive advantage lie? For instance, in the case of Twitter, the key experience of the app is the ability to send a 140-character message. But also keep in mind that your product may have multiple advantages. From there, ask yourself what experiences make your product different. In the example of the wedding-planner app, the defining characteristics are the ability to display wedding venues, options for food vendors and various design themes. Once you’ve identified these essentials, you’re ready to take a look at competitors that are neither direct nor indirect. Your task is to identify features that you can reassemble for your own product. Basically, it’s a chance to be inspired by what already exists and combine it in different ways to disrupt the market. Airbnb did exactly that when they integrated a Google Maps-like element into their app. The final step is to combine all these key experiences into a storyboard that visualizes a user’s flow from point A to point B in your product. For the wedding app, it might go something like this: A future bride browses venues and finds a list of five that she likes. She chooses the one she likes the most, selects a menu and entertainment package, receives a confirmation of her booking and, six months later, is getting married on the beach. To draw out this process, you can simply do a few quick hand sketches or use design software to make something more complete. However you do it, you’ll end up with a map toward value innovation that clearly describes the key features of your new product! The key message in this book: By melding business strategy and user-experience design, you can create products that soar above the competition. This process begins with an approach to business that clearly defines your competitive advantage and results in a product that’s both uniquely desirable and flawlessly designed. Actionable advice: Imagine a future innovation by asking yourself a few simple questions.  Coming up with a groundbreaking business idea is no cakewalk, but you can jump-start the process by considering a few questions: What features from existing products can I adopt, splice together and transform into something better? How can I integrate separate user experiences into a single product that would become the one-stop shop for a certain task? Instagram is a good example as the standard for sharing photos and videos. What product could bring together two different user segments to negotiate deals that were not possible before? Airbnb is the obvious example here, since it succeeded in uniting hosts and visitors in unprecedented ways. Consider these questions for yourself and put your best ideas to the test! Got feedback?

And certainly, huge fortunes have been made. But the real tale of Silicon Valley is one of people and ideas, and how these people – sometimes nerdy, sometimes brash, but always talented – have pursued their dreams and turned their ideas into realities. Silicon Valley is a region in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. This area, a mixture of suburbs and modestly sized cities, is now the world’s leading center for high technology and innovation. Its history is short in terms of time but incredibly rich in terms of discoveries made. Since the late 1960s, Silicon Valley has been at the heart of the invention of personal computers, the internet, handheld devices, online retail, social networks and much, much more. And all of these innovations have been birthed in a profoundly unconventional business environment, one where business founders were often in their early 20s, working all night was common and drug use was practically obligatory. In these blinks, you’ll hear the story of young people working, having fun, innovating and sometimes finding themselves in charge of multimillion- or even multibillion-dollar companies. You’ll also learn how Xerox played a huge role in the development of the modern computer; that one Silicon Valley business almost invented the iPhone, ten years before the iPhone; and why Google’s founders never really wanted to start a business. The classic Silicon Valley story goes something like this: some kid with a radical idea puts together something cool, builds around it a freewheeling business with like-minded techies and becomes insanely rich in the process. Atari, and its founder, Nolan Bushnell, pretty much wrote that script. As a student in the 1960s, Bushnell once snuck into a computer lab late at night to play Spacewar, one of the first computer games. Seeing the possibilities this completely new form of entertainment offered, the entrepreneurial Bushnell set up Atari. Atari’s first completed game was Pong. It was a simple game – like table tennis, played on an arcade machine, with incredibly basic graphics and controls. But it became a phenomenal success. Bushnell put the first Pong arcade machine in the corner of a local bar. Soon thereafter, Atari got a call from the bar owner to say the machine had stopped working. When an Atari engineer got to the bar, they realized that the problem was simple: the coin box was so full of quarters that it wouldn’t take any more. In this one bar, Pong was taking in $300 a week – a huge amount, considering Bushnell could manufacture more Pong machines for $350 each. To deliver as many new machines as possible, early Atari employees worked incredibly hard. But, at the same time, there was a hedonistic side to the culture at Atari. Out back, the smell of marijuana smoke was always in the air. Coworkers slept with each other. There was cocaine use in the company hot tub. This culture started to cause problems after the company was sold to Warner for $30 million in 1976, by which point Atari had progressed beyond just arcade machines and launched one of the first-ever video game consoles. The takeover brought a more corporate approach, as well as a new CEO, a serious businessman named Ray Kassar who’d previously headed Ralph Lauren. His ethos could hardly have differed more from Bushnell’s. Indeed, when the men met for the first time, Bushnell was wearing a T-shirt with the words “I like to fuck” written on it.   The culture clash between the new corporate owners and the freewheeling company atmosphere started to cause problems. Key engineers left, unsatisfied with the company culture, and Atari struggled to reinvent itself after its early success. By 1984, it had crashed completely. Split into smaller parts, the company was sold off. Most people, if asked who built the first personal computer, might think of Apple or perhaps IBM. But, in fact, the business that first built something close to a modern-day PC was Xerox. Today, Xerox is synonymous with photocopying. Indeed, you can use its name as a verb, and ask someone to xerox something for you. But back in the early 1970s, Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center – or PARC, for short – made a major breakthrough in computing when it built the first computer with a modern, visual user interface. Until then, computers had been focused solely on computing – on, quite simply, making mathematical computations. Xerox’s breakthrough was prompted by a handful of engineers who passionately believed that the focus of computers in the future would be the display. One of these engineers was Bob Taylor, who argued that computers needed to change. The eyeball, he said, is the connection between brain and computer. Therefore, the computer’s design needs to be focused on its display. Taylor also passionately believed that the future of computing would be communications, not computing or mathematics, and that computers in the future would be personal, with one on every desk. The computer that was eventually built was called the Alto. It had a lot of features that we’d recognize today, like overlapping windows, icons, fonts and different menus. It had a bitmap display, which meant that it could show pictures on the screen, an innovation which would enable painting, animation and fonts for the first time. It even had a mouse you could use to navigate the screen, albeit one that worked poorly. Further innovations soon followed. Researchers invented the Bravo, an improved machine that, unlike the Alto whose display was black and white, offered 256 different colors. No one had seen color before on a computer, and, unfortunately, the Xerox leadership was skeptical about whether there was a need for it in the marketplace. This wasn’t helped by researchers at PARC using the machine to create hippieish, wacky graphics late at night, which went against the grain of Xerox’s buttoned-up corporate culture. Ultimately, Xerox didn’t push ahead, instead sticking to its specialty – printing. While it failed to exploit many of the computer innovations developed at PARC, though, Xerox’s influence did live on in another company, thanks to a visit from a young, slightly crazy businessman: Steve Jobs. Around the same time that Atari and Xerox were getting started, two Valley geniuses – Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the cofounders of Apple – were also hard at work. Jobs and “the Woz,” as he came to be known, first worked together building and selling highly illegal “blue boxes” – devices that emitted a tone that, when played into a telephone, tricked the network exchange into letting the dialer place free calls. Wozniak, an engineer, designed and built the blue box. But it was Jobs, the more business-minded of the two, who said, “Let’s sell this thing.” It was the start of a transformative partnership, but it wasn’t yet clear that they would build a business together. Jobs landed a job at Atari, where he worked as a technician but soon quit to travel to India in search of a spiritual guru and enlightenment. Months later, he returned to the Atari offices with a shaved head and wearing a saffron robe and asked for his job back. Bushnell gave it to him, but Jobs was put on the night shift, for two reasons. Firstly, Jobs’s difficult personality was causing problems during the day. Secondly, Bushnell knew that if Jobs worked at night, when it was quiet, he’d probably bring his talented friend Wozniak in with him. He would get “two Steves at the price of one,” as Bushnell said. And so it proved to be true. Jobs would let Wozniak in at night, to come play games and tinker with things. Not long after, Bushnell tasked Jobs with building a new game, Breakout, knowing full well that Wozniak, the far more talented engineer, would end up doing the work. In the end, Wozniak designed a game that was exquisitely constructed. The Atari engineers had never seen anything like it. This foreshadowed things to come. Not long after, Wozniak built a personal computer named Apple I, inspired by the innovations happening at Xerox and using spare Atari parts. Seeing a financial opportunity, Jobs suggested they form a company. And thus Apple Computers was born. By 1979, Apple was an established business. Nonetheless, what Xerox was doing at its PARC research facility was still far superior to everything at Apple. But Xerox’s head office showed little interest in personal computers. This meant that, commercially, Xerox PCs were going nowhere fast. Steve Jobs exploited this brilliantly. Jobs asked for a demonstration tour at PARC, in return for letting Xerox make an early investment in Apple. Xerox agreed, and, in December 1979, Jobs visited PARC. He was astonished by the capabilities of the Alto and its graphical user interface. In particular, he was fascinated by the Alto’s mouse, which, for the first time, allowed a personal computer user to point, click, cut, paste, doodle, paint and more. With the click of a mouse, something clicked in Jobs’s brain. In this moment, he would later report, it felt so obvious that every computer would work this way in the future. This visit to Xerox changed everything for Apple. Apple’s future computers would also have a graphical user interface. They introduced now-common terms like “desktop,” “icon” and “mouse” to the general public for the first time. It was the Macintosh computer, released in 1984, that really delivered Jobs’s vision of a consumer-friendly, easy-to-use computer that could be fun as well as productive. Jobs was convinced that the Macintosh was the greatest consumer product in history and demanded marketing that was correspondingly good. An ad agency recruited Blade Runner director Ridley Scott to direct a commercial based on George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984. In the ad, a brave young woman revolts against Big Brother, smashing the screen from which he broadcasts to an audience of zombified masses. It was a thinly veiled allegory for the thoughtful, upstart Apple taking on what they regarded as a soulless enterprise – IBM, the dominant computer corporation at the time. The ad was a huge hit, and, the following day, news networks reported it as news, showing it in full. Days later, Jobs unveiled the Macintosh – literally. Pulling the computer out of a bag, he turned it on and walked away. To a silent auditorium, the computer said, “Hello, I’m Macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag.” A computer that spoke for itself? No one had ever seen, or heard, anything like it. The audience, and the market, was enrapt. General Magic might just be the greatest company you’ve never heard of. The stuff of Silicon Valley legend, General Magic was spun out of Apple in 1990, with many people from the team behind the original Macintosh computer on board. It had an incredible product idea, something far ahead of its time: a handheld gadget, called a personal communicator. The gadget, plugged into a television line, would be able to handle email and phone calls, as well as send SMS-style instant messages with emojis and stickers. It would have an app store with downloadable games, music and programs for checking stock prices and similar activities. A camera attachment would be available. Sound familiar? General Magic had hit on the idea of a kind of smartphone, a full decade before Apple even started working on one. Like so many Silicon Valley projects, the working environment was a little crazy. The company took space in a building that had been empty for ten years and had a pack of feral dogs in the basement. Someone’s pet rabbit lived in the office and, having never been toilet trained, left a mess everywhere. One of the principle engineers, Zarko Draganic, famously lived in the office for months on end. Colleagues would suggest a meeting at three o’clock, and he’d say, “a.m. or p.m.?” The General Magic device was in many ways revolutionary. It had a visual user interface based on the real world, with an image of a desk, on which you could click and then write, and images of filing cabinets that you could click on to store and access files. The icon of a game room’s door led the user to a choice of networked, online games. But the device was also flawed. You had to physically plug it into a phone line to get it to work. It was larger than planned and had poor battery life. It was, ultimately, ahead of its time. The idea came before there was sufficient computing power to deliver on it. The device failed, and General Magic went under, too. But the company left a legacy of talent for the rest of Silicon Valley. Key engineers went on to play critical roles in the development of the iPhone, as well as of Android. And a guy called Pierre Omidyar ran a little site called Auction Web out of his cubicle that would forever change the world of retail. In 1995, Pierre Omidyar was a longhaired young idealist who believed in the inherent goodness of people and the power of markets to improve lives. When a colleague idly suggested that an internet auction site would be cool, Omidyar spent a Labor Day weekend hammering out the code for a primitive online marketplace. The marketplace, called Ebay, relied on a simple honor system to start with – buyers and vendors had no guarantee that they’d get the goods or the cash that they’d been promised. But it turned out that Omidyar’s belief in people’s fundamental honesty was largely correct, and the system worked. Ebay took off – fast. To start with, Omidyar charged a 25-cent listing fee, to be sent to him in the mail. After six or seven weeks, he was receiving a 25-cent payment every day. Six months later, he was receiving literally tons of payments in the mail every day, and soon thereafter he was earning more from Ebay than from his day job. Ebay has made a profit every single quarter since it started – something very few companies can say. As well as rapidly becoming the place to buy and sell everything from best-selling books to obscure collectors items, Ebay also gave the world an innovation that is hugely influential today: the feedback system. Back in the 1990s, the internet was a largely anonymous space, and Omidyar realized he needed a way to allow sellers and buyers to create a reputation, so that people who didn’t “know” them could still trust them and trade with them. He created the feedback forum, allowing people to rate each other and provide feedback on how their transactions went. It seems simple and commonplace today, but at the time, it was completely new and crucial to Ebay’s growth. Ebay went public in 1998, just three years after it was first launched as an experiment. The share price rocketed on the first day of trading. The venture capitalists who had made early investments in Omidyar’s auction site made a thousand-to-one return on their money. The next company that would rise so fast was Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin didn’t originally want to build a search engine. Both graduate students at Stanford, they were working toward doctorates in computer science. And they both loved coming up with imaginative new ideas and concepts. Larry was interested in automating vehicles, and both liked to talk about building a space tether – a rock orbiting earth with a cable coming down that you could use to simply climb up into space. The pair eventually worked together on a doctoral project to map the internet. They literally downloaded the internet’s contents and analyzed connections between web pages. While doing this, the idea of building a search engine wasn’t on their radar, partly because, with engines like Yahoo! and Alta Vista already in existence, a search engine didn’t really feel like legitimate academic research.   But one day, Larry realized that you could identify how important or useful a website is by looking at how many other websites link to it, and which ones. In about eight weeks, Page and Brin used this insight to build a search engine that was more powerful than any other in use. Originally, the pair’s plan was to license their technology, because they wanted to get on with their PhDs rather than waste lots of time creating a business. An early meeting with one search provider, Excite, showed how much better they could do than the existing competition. They showed Excite’s CEO, George Bell, their technology. They went to his search engine, typed in “internet,” and it generated largely random results, mostly in Chinese. Then they typed “internet” into Google. Sensible, useful pages showed up, like the page for Mosaic, the leading web browser at the time. Extraordinarily, Bell told them that he didn’t want their technology. He didn’t want it to be easy for people to find stuff, he said. He wanted people to stay on his site. A short while later, having failed to license their technology to anyone, and realizing that their search engine was more powerful than anything else, Page and Brin founded Google as a company. A short but extraordinary journey to global dominance had begun. Back in the late 1990s, Apple was struggling. The Macintosh may have wowed audiences at it’s launch, but, by 1997, Apple’s personal computers held a risible two-percent share of the market. That year, Steve Jobs returned to Apple after a period running a different tech business, and he started to change things. He drove the launch of the original iMac, with its translucent, colored shell, the first really beautiful desktop computer. And he got behind the creation and launch of the iPod. But while it was hugely fashionable, the iPod wasn’t a very successful product. Apple’s goal had been to use the iPod to sell more Macs, because you would need a Mac to use the music player, and this closed-system approach created a major barrier to customer uptake. Eventually, the Apple executive team convinced Jobs to open up iTunes to Windows so anyone could use the iPod. Soon, Apple was earning literally billions a week from iPods and had a 90-percent market share of the music player business. The next step for Jobs and Apple was the iPhone, developed at breakneck speed due to Jobs’s intense fear that Sony or Motorola would combine a phone with a music player and kill the iPod dead. The first iPhones were terrible – as phones. The engineering team would say, “This is the worst phone I’ve ever used – it barely dials!” But Jobs recognized that the phone capabilities were relatively unimportant. What they were really building was a laptop killer.   The first iPhone was launched at a glitzy event, with Jobs demonstrating it live while his tech team looked on, terrified that the quickly finished software would crash at any moment. It was a success, but the first iPhone had no third-party apps; Jobs wanted a closed system, concerned that if any developer could put something on the phone, it might crash it. But when Google launched Android, with the ability to download third party apps, Jobs panicked, and accepted the need to open up the ecosystem. Apple’s cofounder, Steve Wozniak, has credited the third-party app store as being more groundbreaking than the iPhone itself. It enabled openness, innovation and connectivity. Today, it’s hard to imagine using an iPhone and not being able to load up the Facebook app. But, of course, it’s not so long ago that Facebook didn’t even exist. Fifteen years ago, it was practically impossible to think of a person by name – some guy you’d met in class, for example – and then find a picture of him. At Harvard, individual dorms had paper directories called face-books, with pictures of all their students, but there was no overall listing. Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz decided to create a unified, online version, called The Facebook. A future colossus was born. After rolling out their site as a dorm-room project, Zuckerberg and Moskovitz moved to Silicon Valley with the intention of turning it into a proper business. At the time, Facebook’s mantra was “Move fast and break things,” and in the early days they lived up to it. If new code was ready, it simply got pushed out live, usually in the middle of the night to reduce the impact if it all went wrong. Facebook’s engineers got used to staying up till 6 a.m. to fix things. Even major new changes were introduced quickly. The 2006 introduction of the News Feed feature was revolutionary. Before, Facebook was largely static – you only found things if you went looking for them. Now, News Feed information, as well as news and photos, was pushed straight to you. This major change was rolled out quickly, with a jaunty message that read “Facebook gets a facelift.” People were instantly angry, feeling that their privacy had been violated. Students got petitions together, and even protested, chanting, “Bring back the old Facebook.” But the thing was, at Facebook HQ, they were seeing a funny pattern. When they looked at people’s behavior – even the behavior of people telling Facebook they hated the change – they discovered that everyone was using News Feed. Constantly. People were protesting, while also using Facebook twice as much as before. That Facebook arguably knows more about what its users want than users do themselves is just one facet of the platform’s power. Facebook’s position today as the world’s largest online platform gives it huge power and influence. Some question whether enough consideration has been given to how the values and decisions of Zuckerberg and a small cohort of his young male friends have influenced the direction of the internet, and how we interact with each other. That, however, is a question Silicon Valley will have to address in the future. The key message in these blinks: Silicon Valley is a strange place: a mixture of small cities and suburbia that has had a vast influence on our world today. The intensity of talent in such a small area, combined with access to investment funds, as well as an unusually high tolerance of failure and unusual personalities, has seen this tiny part of the world birth a disproportionate number of the technologies on which billions of us rely every day.

They carefully collected the knowledge of the world and transcribed and conserved it for the future. But with the invention of the printing press, their efforts became obsolete. And now, in the age of the internet and digital technology, printed books are in the boat the monks were once in. In a word, information – once an inert mass, contained in the pages of books – has turned into vapor. Yet it’s not only information that has been vaporized. A number of physical things – and with them whole industries – have begun to vanish into thin air. These blinks explain what an economy in a gaseous state will look like. They tell you what goes hand in hand with the vaporization of information and the economy, which opportunities and risks a vaporized economy entails and how to best prepare for it. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the three chemical states of information; how internet giants like Google and Facebook create value in a vaporized world; and what the vaporization of our economy means for human labor. With all of our handy internet-connected devices, it’s easy to understand why today is called “the information age.” Less easy to understand is how this information behaves. It’s helpful to think of information like water, or other chemical elements since it can exist in a variety of different states depending on how we want to use it. To start with, information can be in a solid state, like in a book or on a CD. The downside of having information in a solid state is that it’s hard to share with more than one person. But selling information in physical form is a convenient way to monetize it, which is another reason why keeping information in a solid state has, historically, been preferred. Remarkably, the way we exchanged information didn’t change much at all between 1455 (when Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press) and the recent emergence of the internet. Throughout this span of time, information was always stored in a solid state, whether as books, CDs or DVDs. Though these physical states are durable and long-lasting ways to store information, they also demand a lot of money and energy to produce and distribute. What’s more, they eat up storage space and can only be shared one person at a time. Plus, things like laser discs quickly become obsolete. So when the internet emerged, people didn’t hesitate to free information from its physical constraints and transform it into a more liquid state. Imagine an ice cube beginning to melt; information, water-like, was now much easier to spread over a large area. With the click of a mouse, it was simple to post, edit and instantaneously share a file with the entire world. But there was still another change of state in store. As information moved from desktop computers to the smartphones, it became like a vapor: fast-moving, free and constantly changing. This is where we are now. With high-speed internet in our pockets, information is no longer bound to your office, or even to your laptop. It moves all around you, like atmospheric gasses. No matter where or who you are, be it a scientist in a lab or a monk in a mountaintop monastery, today learning anything, at any time, is but a tap or two away. One of the greatest strengths of today’s software-based technologies is that they allow us to do more with fewer resources. They help us monitor and analyze functions while providing new information and insights that allow us to make better designs. For instance, today’s cars can collect data about their own performance, and this data helps car companies produce more efficient models that pollute less. Software can even be used to replace major utilities, such as telecommunications networks that handle the traffic of thousands of people talking and messaging. With today’s advanced software, we could get rid of all the telephone poles and wires, and replace them with an efficient internet-based network that would route calls better and more reliably than before. Many of the physical goods in our day-to-day life could also be replaced by software, along with all of those old CDs and DVDs. It’s only a matter of time. Vaporization will encompass everything, from single jobs and stores to companies and entire industries. Anything that can be vaporized and replaced with software will be vaporized. Indeed, this process has already begun, and the music industry is a prime example. Big record shops have been replaced by online services like the iTunes store and Amazon. Instead of dealing with limited physical selections and waiting in line at a store, now anyone with an internet connection has access to a wealth of digital music. And when these record stores are replaced, the whole consumer experience and supply chain are vaporized too. The industry that produces CD packaging will disappear too, as will the warehouses that stored inventories of CDs. And the same fate awaits the industries that produce secondary products like CD players. All of them will have been made redundant by software. Internet giants like eBay, Amazon, Google and Snapchat didn’t stumble upon popularity. Each company knew how to connect the right people with one another, kind of like the operators at an old-fashioned switchboard. For Amazon and eBay, the “right people” were obvious – these platforms wanted to connect buyers with sellers. But the same strategy holds true for other internet giants. Google has made a fortune connecting information seekers with those who have the information being sought. YouTube connects video producers with viewers. And social apps like Snapchat are just facilitators for everyday people who want to stay connected with one another. But as each of these companies grew, their ecosystem of connections became more complex as different and unexpected users joined in. Take Apple’s App Store, for instance. What started as a place for developers to sell helpful applications soon morphed into a highly competitive marketplace, with developers hiring firms to raise their sales. These platforms aren’t the kinds of public spaces where people can exercise freedom of speech. The platform owner can make up arbitrary rules – whether well explained or not – that they can then enforce, which gives users two choices: either to comply completely or not participate at all Apple says this ensures the apps being sold in the App Store meet their standards for what’s acceptable. Yet they often give vague reasons, like an app being “creepy,” “objectionable” or “over the line” to explain a rejection. And even though fart apps routinely get kicked out, you can find, for example, a “Sexy Poker” app in their store. It should also be noted that Apple receives 30 percent of every purchase in the App Store, but that the system for determining an app’s ranking, which plays a huge role in an app’s chances for success, is also extremely vague. This has led to rumors that secret payoffs, bribes, gifts and other dubious methods can be used to boost an app’s ranking in the store. Making up rules isn’t just a way for internet companies to control user behavior; it can also help ensure that users remain loyal and return to the platform. This can be difficult in a vaporized economy, as users tend to gravitate toward whichever platform is the biggest. So let’s look at some different methods companies use to bind people to a platform and make them more active – all while generating more profits in the process. One of the most common ways to hold on to users is to create unique tools that allow them to generate their own content. Whether they’re posting photos or videos, or just creating chat threads, these tools promote engagement and keep users from leaving, because, if they leave, they lose access to all their content. This is why Apple and Google offer free content creation tools in the form of iMovie and YouTube. Another effective way to keep users loyal is to make it easy to find content and then share and chat about it. Facebook and other social media companies thrive on this dynamic. It’s also common for successful platforms to offer storage and playback features to their users. Without these features, platform owners run the risk of users finding a way to take their content elsewhere. This is why Google has a whole line of hardware such as the Chromebook and Nexus, as well as features like the Chromecast. It’s also why Apple provides content that is only compatible with their own products. Providing content can also lead to monetization when a platform establishes its own marketplace for content, where owners can take a cut of each transaction, as in the iTunes Store. But another popular method used by many platforms is to get users to fill out elaborate profiles, after which they can sell this detailed user data to marketing firms. The vaporized economy has offered a variety of ways for businesses to make money, most of which involve turning data into big bucks. Having people constantly connected to the internet produces massive amounts of data, and this amount is set to grow further. By 2020, it’s estimated that every person will be producing a mind-boggling 1.7 megabits of data per second. This will be due to the internet of things, where everyday objects, like your refrigerator and washing machine, will all be connected to the internet and collecting data. Today, most of us still like to think that there is some time during the day when we’re offline. But, before long, we’ll all be permanently connected and continuously producing data. When this happens, big-data companies will mine the output coming from these appliances and monitor and improve on the measurements. Take a keg of beer, for instance. The US company SteadyServ has a sensor that goes on the bottom of a keg and streams data to a server to allow restaurants and bars to manage their inventories in real time. So, when a keg is nearly empty, an alert can be triggered for a replacement. But more importantly, companies will also be able to closely monitor sales at different bars in real time to get a better understanding of local, state-wide or national trends. Traditional companies are also placing more and more value on data, but they struggle with the sheer volume of it all.  The challenge lies in how to archive, sort, search and effectively analyze data for useful information, all while keeping it out of the hands of malicious hackers. But surmounting this challenge will unlock plenty of future business opportunities. Back in the day, a business could be accurately valued by taking stock of its physical assets. But this doesn’t apply to companies like Airbnb and Uber, which have no actual rooms or cars of their own. So how does Airbnb get valued at $30 billion and Uber at $66 billion? They create a peer-to-peer marketplace by operating software that acts as the middleman between their clients, who own the apartments and cars, and their users, who want to temporarily use this property. This model is also known as “access-instead-of-ownership” and part of the platform’s success is due to its collaborative nature, matching, for example, users seeking lodging with those who already own apartments that they can rent out. In addition, both parties can choose whether or not they want to do business with the other based on ratings from previous transactions. And innovative blockchain technology promises to take this model to the next level by vaporizing even more middlemen. Blockchain technology relies on the principles of cryptography to allow for business transactions between two parties without any company or banking oversight, and thus without any associated fees. It’s already being used for Bitcoin, the electronic currency. Platforms operating on blockchain payments can be completely independent of banks and credit card companies that take big percentages on transactions and sell user data for dubious purposes. A “blockchain” version of Airbnb, for instance, could allow users and owners to save money. Another example of a streamlined service is crowdfunding, which is making it easier for entrepreneurs to find funding. Crowdfunding bypasses the slow, traditional process of raising investor funds by getting rid of the paperwork and endless interviews. It puts the power in the hands of individuals to reach out on a software platform, attract investors through incentives and even integrate feedback during the development process. The previous blinks have described the vaporization of services, physical products and even entire industries. So you may well be wondering, “How many jobs is this going to take away?” It’s true that, along with the vaporization of human labor, automated robots are already capable of replacing a number of human tasks. At the Henn-na Hotel in Nagasaki, Japan, ten robots are capable of maintaining the hotel by performing a variety of functions, including carrying luggage, changing bed sheets and cleaning rooms. These aren’t exactly desirable jobs, but other fields such as journalism, medicine, law and accounting are also already under threat of becoming automated. In fact, a 2011 Oxford report estimated that 47 percent of all US jobs could soon be automated. This might not be entirely bad news. There are optimists who see automation as a chance to raise the living standards of everyone and expand personal freedoms. But then there are also those who believe that automation will render a large portion of society permanently unemployed. The important question is whether or not automation will destroy more jobs than new forms of businesses can create. Unfortunately, it’s too soon to tell. But what we do know for certain is that our education system is unprepared to deal with the challenge of re-educating and training millions of displaced workers. It was never designed to educate a workforce and teach professional skills, but rather to teach students about abstract ideas. In a vaporized economy, the education system must adapt so that humans perform the tasks that computers can’t handle, like holding student discussions, debating and applying knowledge in novel ways to solve ideas. While we might not be able to prevent the loss of jobs, we can make sure we’re ready and prepared for what lies ahead. The key message in this book: Thanks to the advent of the internet, more and more information is vaporizing – that is, becoming divorced from tangible objects and entering the cloud. By leveraging information from our environment and feeding it into software, we will be able to do ever more things with ever fewer resources. Today, the data a business generates and collects is its primary asset. And the success of future generations may depend on their ability to perform jobs that can’t be automated. Actionable advice: Be aware of the role you play online. Everything you do in a virtual store is tracked. Every offer you notice and respond to is processed and used to build a profile of you. So think twice whether you really need a profile on that shopping site and whether you agree with the access rights of that app you just downloaded. Got feedback?

It’s also completely transforming the world and the ways we live in it, which is slightly scary. These blinks are about two tech developments in particular – platforms and algorithms – and how they’ve become the building blocks of almost all new technologies. From humble yet exciting beginnings to almost-global influence, their story is an exciting one. So get ready to learn how they work, what applications they have beyond science and technology and also how to handle any problems that may be – or already have been – created by them. You’ll also learn what a “two-pizza team” is; why algorithms are like Arabian djinns; and where machines have already taken over. Remember when you saw your first touchscreen phone or virtual-reality headset? Or when your first Uber car arrived at your doorstep? You may have thought, “WTF?” The new technologies just keep on coming – and they’re forever changing the world we live in. Two monumental developments are at the heart of the modern industry: artificial intelligence, in the form of algorithms, and modern digital platforms. Modern digital platforms are based on open-source software, which was developed in the 1990s. This type of software is free, and any user can access and edit it for the benefit of all – a model that’s diametrically opposed to closed-software platforms such as those used by Microsoft, who dominated the industry at the time by locking hardware developers into their operating systems. The shift began with the rise of Linux, and was highlighted in a 1997 paper by Eric Raymond called “The Cathedral and the Bazaar.” Rather than worshipping at the altar of Microsoft, Linux users worldwide, from hackers to developers, pooled their resources and encouraged the free trade of knowledge. This established a template for digital platforms, where the level of freedom and cooperation generates rapid growth. Modern companies such as Uber and Amazon are built around this model, acting either as hosts or as a marketplace to connect users But these platforms couldn’t operate at such a level of complexity without the algorithms that govern them. Every platform is run by multiple algorithms, each designed to complete a specific task. Computer algorithms can process enormous amounts of data in almost no time at all and manage complex functions that no human could handle, such as coordinating the vast Uber network of passengers and drivers. Once programmed, algorithms operate independently. Because of this, they’re often referred to as a sort of artificial intelligence, or AI. And their operations are only becoming more advanced. So, now that you understand the principles of these two developments, let’s take a look at the effects that they have on businesses and the world around them. First up: platforms. From Google to Amazon, Foursquare to Lyft, user-based platforms have proven immensely successful and lucrative. But what if you applied this model to other structures? Let’s find out with the help of Amazon, which is structured around many two-pizza teams – a phrase the company coined to refer to a team small enough to be fed by two pizzas. Each team has the freedom to pursue its own goals, and has a specific customer in mind, even if that “customer” is within the company. Basically, every team acts like an individual developer, each of whom contributes to the communal platform that is Amazon. Breaking the company up into many little teams, each performing a specific function, made it easier for Amazon to spot and pinpoint problems. The issue could then be fixed by readjusting the relevant team. Now that you understand what an autonomous-platform model might look like, imagine if it were applied to government? Traditionally, governments act as a sort of “vending machine.” Citizens put money in and, in return, are given access to a limited and predetermined selection of benefits: standard options for health care and education and welfare and so on. You get to choose, but you have no say in what you get to choose among. In contrast, if a platform-modeled government identified a problem, it wouldn’t try to solve it alone; rather, it would identify and then coordinate the parties required to fix it. This is a lot like the Apple App Store. Apple itself doesn’t build the bulk of the apps. It hosts a platform where users can find and exchange the services they require. In the same way, rather than presuming and dictating what would be best for people, a platform-modeled government would orchestrate the cooperation of its citizens when an issue arises, acting as a small government that provides big services.   The platform model may be the new face of technology, but it wouldn’t exist without algorithms. So how exactly might these affect business structures? Well, they’ve actually already begun influencing traditional business hierarchies. Indeed, Amazon’s two-pizza teams may well have been inspired by algorithms, considering how similarly they function. Like these teams, some algorithms independently monitor and regulate their own efficiency through what is known as a fitness function. They produce smaller programs to approach specific goals in different ways, and can then assess their efficiency and delete those that don’t perform as well, keeping only the best in service. Think of the way search engines work: they check which results are clicked on the most, learning over time that these are the most relevant and that whatever algorithm finds them is the most effective. This is based on evolutionary biology, and it’s basically a digital version of survival of the fittest: whichever algorithm outperforms the others will pass on its code, just as only the fittest animal species pass on their DNA. But there’s still a problem with algorithms. They’re not exactly practically-minded entities, and they still need human supervision. In fact, they‘re a lot more like the mythical djinns, or genies, of Arabia, who grant the wishes of those who ask, but creatively interpret them, to unexpected, and often troublesome, effect. So when you program an algorithm to perform a certain function, it will unquestioningly grant your wishes but remain utterly oblivious to any unexpected consequences or collateral damage that it might cause along the way. This obedience is akin to traditional factory models, except that algorithms have replaced the workers. Humans are essentially the factory managers, keeping watch over multiple functions and reprogramming any algorithms that act out of line. You’ve now seen where and how these technologies are restructuring business hierarchies. So the question becomes whether or not all of this is actually a good thing. In the next few blinks, we’ll look at some concerns people have about algorithmic technology. When you think of rogue AI, you might imagine HAL9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Skynet in The Terminator. But you can rest easy once the credits roll because these are a long way from reality. Right? Well, there are actually rogue algorithms already operating, and some of them are right under our noses. For example, the recent phenomena of fake news and filter bubbles are actually side effects of algorithmic technology. Like those rogue djinns, the algorithms controlling social media and search engines can only do what they’re told. However, they haven’t been programmed to spread honest journalism. Their sole goal is to maximize data traffic. As a result, your social-media feeds are probably full of content similar to that you’ve already reacted positively to. And, eventually, the algorithm will filter out all opinions different from those you already hold. These algorithms also disregard whether or not something is even true, as most of them can’t actually tell. This was made clear in the wake of the 2016 US election, when Facebook was accused of not doing enough about the spread of fake news articles. CEO Mark Zuckerberg at first denied this but eventually admitted it was a problem since algorithms just promote what is popular and trending. Though worrying, this problem seems more like a side effect of algorithms than out-of-control AI. But we’re also at the mercy of a much more frightening digital force that’s only out for its own gain: the modern financial market. Things started going wrong during the 1970s and 1980s, when shareholder value – that is, making money for the people who hold company shares – became the most important goal for businesses. This model ignores the human interests of goods and services – tangible things that we can actually buy – and focuses only on numbers. More recently, financial centers such as Wall Street were computerized to increase their speed and efficiency. Computers can spot market changes infinitely faster than humans can, so high-frequency-trading algorithms give traders the edge over others. However, these high speeds also put the market outside of human understanding and therefore out of human control. Together, these two developments have created a market where computers are working faster than we can comprehend, with the single goal of improving short-term profits, regardless of any human costs. You can see the effects in the relentless pursuit of GDP, as well as the uptick in recessions and financial crashes. And the worst part? This isn’t even malicious, just another djinn doing what it’s told! From bank tellers to ticket offices, you’ve probably seen the effects of automation, or at least heard somewhere that machines are taking our jobs. But is this actually happening? To some extent, yes. We’re currently unable to find new forms of work as fast as we’re making others obsolete. In the twentieth century, an economist called John Maynard Keynes referred to this as technological unemployment, and it’s responsible for much of our apprehension about technology. In fact, 63 percent of Americans feel that jobs are less secure today than they were two to three decades ago, and, as mentioned earlier, some workers are already being replaced by algorithms. Since computers can handle tasks at incredible speeds and with reliable results, it makes economic sense to use them instead of humans, who are notoriously – well – human. But technological unemployment isn’t the only change automation is causing. It’s also creating a different type of working condition: continuous partial employment. You can see this best in the role of Uber drivers, who straddle the line between secure employment and independent contractors. They don’t work in exchange for a regular paycheck or provide services to several companies. Rather, they work for a single employer whenever it suits them and for however long, and are paid accordingly. This is only made possible by platform- and algorithm-based structures. Technically speaking, Uber drivers are doing all the work, and the platform – managed by algorithms – simply puts them in touch with customers, before taking a cut of the profits. The resulting freedom may be good for some, but it is very insecure work, as Uber is not contractually obliged to give work or benefits to the drivers. So technology is clearly having a large effect on workforces, but maybe this isn’t a problem. In the next blinks, we’ll look at how these changes can be cultivated into a force for good. During the early nineteenth century, British weavers in Nottinghamshire intentionally destroyed many of the new machine looms that had recently been introduced because the machines were threatening their traditional craftsmanship. The weavers were following the example of the folk hero Ned Ludd, who’d supposedly done the same years earlier. This is actually the root of the word Luddite – someone who opposes technological changes. Their concerns were justified, and the new technology led to widespread unemployment, as described by John Maynard Keynes. But Keynes, speaking metaphorically, went on to describe this period of worker redundancy as “growing-pains” rather than old age – and, sure enough, employment did eventually bounce back. The traditional craftsmanship of the Luddites became factory work, and over time that became the office-based and service-sector jobs that we know so well today. So there is every possibility that our current disruptions are just the turning point toward a new dominant form of work. Rather than rejecting technological changes, we should try to embrace them and their potential benefits. One way to do this would be to work with rather than against the job insecurity of continuous partial employment, and not try to stamp it out. The focus should be on the freedom it gives employers, employees and customers, as well as on fixing and improving platforms rather than rejecting them outright. Another way to embrace technology would be for employers to augment their workers, rather than just replacing them. Much like workers in the Apple Store, who are all equipped with a smartphone or tablet, augmented employees can create a superior customer or user experience by bringing together the capabilities of computers and the personal touch of humans. Augmentation is actually a natural part of human development; technologies are first discovered, then shared and eventually embedded into tools to make them available to anyone. Few of us know much about code, but we have it embedded in our smartphones and use it to supplement our day-to-day lives, which is just a more advanced version of carrying around a box of matches instead of knowing how to start a fire. The world will continue to change, thanks to the development of new technologies. But what will either limit or liberate you is how you approach the new, and whether you’re willing to work with, rather than against, it. A good place to start is by no longer applying old regulations to new technologies. A lot of the conflict between regulators and technology companies comes from the fact that certain rules just don’t apply anymore. For example, the author once had to debate a lawyer for the Authors Guild, which was suing Google for scanning books into the nascent Google Book Search database. The lawyer argued that this was copyright infringement, but the author explained that the scans weren’t made to be published, but were actually a vital part of making a functioning search index. If they’d been stopped, the project wouldn’t have worked. Perhaps, like the rolling updates and community input of open-source technology, basic laws should be set, and the actual regulation to enforce them consistently updated depending on the changing circumstances of technology. But we shouldn’t just worry about how tech is policed; we should also ask why it’s developed in the first place. If developers have goals beyond monetary gain, then technology is almost guaranteed to serve humanity, rather than the other way around, because it’ll have been programmed to help people from the get-go. The major issue – as with the financial market – is that reactionary attitudes and short-term profits will inevitably lead to a dead end. The actual pioneers of the technology industry are those who look for something more than money. Those that follow are generally only after their own financial gain. Instead of this, you should strive to contribute more to industry and society than what’s in your pocket. Take the author’s own business, O’Reilly Media, which has taught and inspired many start-ups and budding billionaires. It doesn’t matter that the business has also made money – only that it’s improved the market by inspiring others. And what does this culture of sharing remind you of? The very nature of open-source software and platforms. It’s the sharing of knowledge and innovation that makes technology a force that serves us before it serves itself. And when that happens, you’ll only find yourself exclaiming “WTF?” in delight. The key message in this book: There is no doubt that technology is changing almost everything about the way we live, and there is little point in trying to stand in its way. But whether or not society has to suffer as a result is entirely up to us and how we approach it. As long as we are aware of the potential misuses of technology, and choose to embrace it as a tool for teaching and creativity, we can be sure to build the world of the future that works best for us. Actionable advice: Spot the seeds of the future. Rather than focus on the flavor of the month, look to the fringes of technology to try and imagine for yourself what will be the next big revolution. If you look for patterns, like the reimagining of open-source software as platforms, you can determine the most important trends, and pick out the next big thing. And if you’re in control of the future today, you can be sure that it develops with noble goals and an ethical mind-set. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The unofficial “frontpage” of the global web, its boisterous users have made the site into one of the world’s most important online communities. It’s a big tent. From hobbyists sharing their passion for niche subjects to pornographers testing the limits of free speech and political partisans hammering out the latest talking points, Reddit has attracted a huge and occasionally downright unruly following. So, how did the company get to where it is today – the sixth most viewed site in the United States? Well, as these blinks show, it was a pretty rocky road. From early bust-ups between its founders to the tricky process of commercializing the site while keeping that anarchical user base on their side, the story of Reddit’s rise is every bit as dramatic as the forums on its site. Filled with beer-fuelled college dorm fantasies of making it big, erratic breakdowns, epic trolling scandals and ruthless CEO-led purges, this is the ultimate inside story of a company that’s changed the way we think about the internet. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how Reddit used every trick in the book to get itself off the ground; why its founders’ commitment to free speech landed the site in hot water; and how Reddit’s users have constrained the company’s decision-makers. Reddit’s story begins at the University of Virginia in 2001. Roommates Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman were pretty normal freshmen, albeit with a pronounced geeky streak. They ate pizza, drank beer, tinkered with their computers and played video games. Both were fascinated by the emerging startup scene, but they were still waiting for their killer idea. In fact, it was only four years later that the seeds of what would become one of the internet’s most popular websites were planted. In 2005, the duo attended a talk by Paul Graham, a well-known computer programmer and entrepreneur, as well as the mind behind the business incubator Y Combinator. Graham was offering $6,000 to potential founders to develop their ideas over the summer. That sounded like a pretty good deal to Ohanian and Huffman – after all, they needed to pay for pizza and beer! They pitched an idea for a company that would use mobile technology to order food from gas stations. Graham wasn’t exactly blown away, but he was impressed by the pair’s can-do attitude. He gave them $12,000 and tasked them with coming up with a way to aggregate the best of the web’s endless supply of content. By the end of that summer, Reddit was born. Graham retained a stake in the project and continued to advise Ohanian and Huffman. Reddit didn’t come out of the blue – in fact, the concept itself was already fairly established. What was new, though, were the site’s features. Take upvotes and downvotes, for example. These let users give a virtual thumbs up – or down – to content posted to the site. That’s the system that puts frequently upvoted links, pictures and text posts on the Reddit homepage, where it’s guaranteed to be seen. It’s a neat way of effectively outsourcing editorial decisions and allowing users to define what matters to them and their communities. Another novel feature was subreddits, separate pages where users could delve into niche topics and interests. Today, there are millions of these Reddits within Reddits for everything from political discussions, on the r/Politics subreddit, to mutual appreciation, like on r/EarthPorn – a page devoted to sharing stunning pictures of our planet. The early twenty-first century has been largely defined by the stunning rise of Silicon Valley. Within a decade, a small group of tech-savvy twentysomethings created services like PayPal and Uber, which would go on to transform our societies and economies. The meteoric rise of this elite group of startups is often the cause of a misconception – namely, that anyone with coding skills and a concept can make billions. In reality, the road to online dominance is often slow and difficult. So, how did Reddit do it? Essentially, it was Graham’s insistence on developing a minimum viable product – MVP for short – which shaped Reddit in the early days. An MVP is the cornerstone of what’s since become known as a lean startup – a no-frills operation that ignores what big companies traditionally spend a lot of time and money on, like scalability, internationalization and security. Graham wasn’t interested in slick designs or fancy features. What he wanted Ohanian and Huffman to deliver was a streamlined version of their product that simply worked, and quickly! The great thing about focusing on creating an MVP, Graham argued, is that it allows developers to listen to user feedback early on in the design process. That, in turn, means they don’t have to second-guess what features people want. Even better, getting a product out there in the world – however bare-bones – is a great way of attracting the attention of large institutional investors. This, however, was only the first step – there’d be plenty of hard work left for Ohanian and Huffman even after they got their MVP up and running. The most important task was to find actual users. Reddit, after all, was built as a platform for user-generated content. Without that, it was little more than a digital graveyard. The solution? Growth hacking. It’s a pretty crude technique, but it works. Rather than waiting around for real people to start using your site, you create a ton of fake accounts and start posting content yourself. From the outside, the site suddenly looks like a vibrant, buzzing community – something that actual people want to get involved in! “The company makes the feast,” according to an old English proverb. What this means is that it’s the people you’re with, rather than the trappings of the occasion, that matter. Ohanian and Huffman would discover the truth of the idiom when Reddit hired a certain Aaron Swartz. You might know Swartz as the internet wunderkind who ended his own life at the age of just 26 after being prosecuted for hacking the academic journal JSTOR. But Swartz was a legend among programmers long before his death. No wonder – he’d already co-written the RSS 1.0 standard, a method of syndicating news content, by the time he was 14. A gifted computing mind with a pronounced anarchical streak, he seemed a perfect match for Reddit. After a merger with Swartz’s old startup Infogami, Swartz, Ohanian and Huffman became the directors of a new entity, Not A Bug, Inc., in January 2006. Things got off to a flying start. Swartz helped Reddit switch to Python, a versatile programming language which outperformed the clunky Lisp language favored by Graham. But this honeymoon period wouldn’t last. Tensions mounted a couple of months into the partnership as Swartz became increasingly erratic. The first warning signs came when he took to his personal blog to write about how disenchanted he’d become with programming. Writing code, he claimed, just wasn’t something he could see himself doing for the rest of his life. Swartz began isolating himself from his fellow directors and stopped contributing code entirely. By this stage, Swartz was regularly disappearing for days at a time. The only way to keep track of him was to read his blog, a project that took up more and more of his time. When he wasn’t preoccupied with that, he was throwing himself headlong into new ventures, like building a new search engine for Amazon. Then there was his newfound interest in child development, a topic that fascinated him so much he began writing a book about it! These issues were taking a toll on the Reddit team, which was now close to burnout. But there wasn’t time to take a break – a huge deal was on the horizon: Reddit’s sale to media conglomerate Condé Nast. By the fall of 2006, Reddit was thriving. Although still in its infancy, it had just under a million monthly readers. New subreddits like r/DIY were booming while “not safe for work” content – the term soon became a simple euphemism for porn – hosted on pages like r/NSFW drew in seemingly endless streams of viewers. While that wasn’t much compared to the numbers generated by other sites, it was an outstanding achievement for a website that was just 16 months old. Reddit had put itself on the map, and other companies were beginning to pay attention. Condé Nast, the New York-based media giant behind magazines like the New Yorker and Wired, was one of them. In October 2006, it acquired Reddit. As it soon found out, there was more to this new kid on the block than met the eye. That was something the Reddit team knew all too well. They’d gone to great lengths to present their company in the best possible light during negotiations, but it was a tough sell. By this stage, Swartz had completely alienated – and barely spoke to – Ohanian and Huffman. Worst of all, the trio was still sharing the same apartment. Swartz only emerged from his room, forced smile at the ready, to field video calls from Condé Nast. Once the conference was over, he moodily retreated. But the deal went through, and Reddit became a subsidiary of Condé Nast. The asking price? A cool $10 million. After the sale, Swartz, Ohanian and Huffman became employees of the company and moved to San Francisco to take up their positions in Wired’s headquarters. Condé Nast was happy, initially at least, to take a back seat and let the Reddit founders do their thing. There was a good reason for this light touch – the conglomerate was terrified of alienating Reddit’s fickle user base. It also wasn’t sure what the platform it had just bought actually was. In the early days, Wired editors would walk past the Reddit crew and tell their guests “This is Reddit. We don’t really know what they do.” Swartz’s behavior, however, had become so erratic that even a company as committed to benign neglect as Condé Nast had to take action. After being asked to resign, Swartz posted a photo of himself wearing a Wired t-shirt on his blog, the first letter of the name changed to an “F.” Reddit continued to expand at a steady clip over the three years following its acquisition by Condé Nast. It doubled its traffic every six months, added new features and consolidated its reputation as the front page of the internet. From the outside, it looked like a phenomenal success. But that was largely down to its hilarious crowdsourced content. Take a gag that made the rounds in 2008, the year the European Organization for Nuclear Research – EONR – completed its work on the Large Hadron Collider. The New York Times ran an article considering whether the research facility might open a black hole. The photo it ran alongside the story featured a scientist who bore a striking resemblance to Gordon Freeman, the hero of the video game Half-Life. Ironically, Freeman’s role in the popular first-person shooter is to fight off alien creatures who arrive on Earth through a portal to another dimension with a variety of weapons, including a distinctive red crowbar. The story was destined to become a meme. Sure enough, Reddit user Mad_Gouki was soon suggesting that Redditors – as the site’s users are called – should mail the EONR a red crowbar. Ohanian immediately recognized the publicity value of such a prank and dispatched the tool. What he hadn’t predicted was that the Freeman lookalike, scientist Sandro Bonacini, would reply with photographs of himself wielding the iconic Half-Life melee weapon. Ohanian shared the picture, and the joke came full circle. Along the way, it had generated a ton of clicks. Things weren’t nearly as hilarious inside Reddit, however. After three years of living and working together, Ohanian and Huffman were exhausted. Their personal and creative differences had grown, and stormy arguments had become commonplace. Worst of all, there was no escape – at the end of the day, they still had to share a car home. Ohanian was also in the middle of a family crisis and was regularly flying across the US to visit his terminally ill mother. The mental and physical strain just wasn’t sustainable. Ohanian decided that he had enough money in the bank to call it a day and pursue other projects. In late 2009, he quit Reddit for good. Huffman meanwhile had become disillusioned with his new bosses and followed Ohanian out the door in 2010. That left longstanding Reddit employee Chris Slowe in charge. “The customer is always right.” It’s a favorite business maxim, and for good reason. But when it comes to Reddit, customers aren’t just always right – there wouldn’t even be a product without them! That’s something the company learned from watching what happened to a competitor, Canadian content aggregator Digg, when it rubbed its users the wrong way. In 2010, Digg received $40 million in venture capital. As always, its investors weren’t contributing their hard-earned cash out of the goodness of their hearts. They wanted returns – the bigger, the better – and Digg redesigned its user interface to give publishers a way of promoting paid content. “Digg 4.0,” as the flashy new version of the site was called, wasn’t popular. In resistance to this act of “commercialization,” its users abandoned the platform and defected to Reddit. The possibility of that happening to Reddit haunted the company’s directors, giving the site’s users a huge amount of influence over policy. Take Reddit’s decision to start hosting adverts in 2007. One of the first groups to buy up advertising space was a group of Redditors in favor of legalizing cannabis – a popular cause on the website. Condé Nast, however, didn’t want to be seen supporting such a campaign and backed out of the deal. Terrified of a user rebellion, the Reddit team decided to simply run the ads for free. The desire to keep its users on their side also motivated Yishan Wong, Reddit’s first CEO, to introduce the unorthodox policy of donating ten percent of all advertising revenue to charities chosen by Redditors in 2014. Financially, that made little sense – Reddit was still far from turning a profit. But, as Wong made clear in a post, the commitment wasn’t about money so much as reassuring Redditors that the company was looking out for their interests. The fear of a mass walkout hasn’t just molded company policy, though – it’s also the cause of some of the site’s most profound crises. No policy exemplified that better than the opposition to censorship, which helped make Reddit notorious. While Reddit’s infancy was pretty rocky, that was nothing compared to the controversies that engulfed the site as it entered puberty. That’s when the effects of the site’s uncompromising attitude toward free speech first became fully apparent. The results weren’t pretty. Free speech absolutism meant letting anyone say anything they want. In the world of Reddit, that led to the emergence of some pretty appalling communities. Take the r/Anarchism thread. Posts advocating rape, terrorism and violence came a dime a dozen. When Reddit tried to convince moderators to dial it down a notch, they were met with indignant refusals and abuse. But that was nothing compared to the most notorious subreddit of them all – r/Jailbait, a forum for users to upload sexualized images of minors and home to some pretty disturbing characters. At its peak, the community had 20,000 followers. The king of the castle was an infamous moderator named Violentacrez. Reddit had long been committed to keeping its rules simple and interfering as little as possible in its users’ behavior, but r/Jailbait took things too far. In 2011, it earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first subreddit ever to be removed from the site. It wouldn’t be the last time Reddit’s administrators encountered Violentacrez, however. In October 2012, Gawker published journalist Adrien Chen’s exposé, which revealed that user Violentacrez was a 49-year-old Texan man and troll extraordinaire named Michael Brutsch. Over the years, Brutsch had created over 500 unsavory Reddit forums, making him the most prolific publisher of obscenities on the whole site. Brutsch’s kingdom of filth included r/Creepshots, a subreddit devoted to non-consensual photos of women, and other misogynist forums like r/ChokeABitch. As if that wasn’t enough, he was also the mind behind a number of antisemitic outlets featuring names like r/Hitler and r/JewMerica. Removing these communities was easy enough, but it raised a bigger issue. Reddit’s hardline free speech policy had inevitably provided a safe space for bigots and fanatics of all stripes. What was the solution? Staffers at the company often pointed out that you can’t have one without the other, likening the site to an ocean – a huge, untameable realm made up of thousands of different microclimates and ecosystems. Most of it is vibrant and beautiful, but there’s no sugarcoating the fact that there’ll always be dark, cold depths filled with horrifying predators. Ohanian and Huffman’s departure left a void at the top of Reddit. The board needed a talented leader to unite the staff, promote Reddit’s founding values and deliver growth. Their first choice was Yishan Wong, who became the company’s first CEO in 2012. But he wouldn’t last long in his new position. Stress would once again get the better of Reddit’s leadership. Wong’s primary target – making Reddit profitable – was a mammoth undertaking. But he did give it a go. During his tenure, the platform experimented with new revenue streams like “Reddit Gold.” That was essentially a premium membership that gave users extra features, allowing them to turn off advertising and create custom avatars. It was a neat idea, but it didn’t get the company much closer to its goal. Wong wasn’t exactly easy to get along with, either. A confrontational manager, he soon alienated his staff. And, like Swartz before him, he became increasingly erratic over time. When he wasn’t arguing with ex-employees in internet forums, he was attempting to move the company headquarters to a far-flung suburb on the outskirts of San Francisco – a decision which seemed to have no other motivation than that it was closer to his own home. The board’s refusal of Wong’s relocation scheme was a tipping point. The next day, he didn’t show up for work. In fact, he would never set foot in the office again. Wong had quit without notice, leaving the company leaderless. Asked about his behavior later on, he chalked it up to post-traumatic stress disorder – a common complaint among the company’s former staffers. The next name to be pulled out of the hat was that of the highly capable Ellen Pao. But her stint as CEO wasn’t to be a happy one, either. Employees complained about her abrasive leadership style, the new atmosphere of fear and intimidation and Pao’s desire to replace the whole team with loyalists. They weren’t wrong, as community manager David Coach soon learned. Pao fired him over the phone while he was undergoing treatment for leukemia. The reason? As Coach remembers it, Pao’s words were simply, “you’re too sick to properly fulfill your duties as community manager.” Coach wasn’t the only team member to face the chop. Someone or other would always be missing at the weekly Wednesday staff meeting – leading staff to start referring to it as “Wednesday, Bloody Wednesday!” 2015 was a bad year for Reddit. It was under fire for hosting hate speech on its site while its employees were demoralized and, frankly, miserable. But there was a silver lining. Reports of Pao’s heavy-handed management style had reached Redditors, who quickly mobilized to call for her resignation. When an online petition in favor of her exit gathered over 200,000 signatures in the summer of 2015, Pao bowed to popular pressure and quit. That once again left a vacuum at Reddit. Who should fill it? Well, it was time for Ohanian and Huffman to return to their old company. Five years of therapy and new projects had been good for the duo. When news of Reddit’s troubles broke, Huffman reached out to Ohanian, and they organized a meeting in a restaurant to talk out their differences. Huffman told Ohanian that he’d resented him for hiring programmers behind his back. Ohanian meanwhile confessed that he believed Huffman had been sabotaging his post-Reddit career. By the end of the meal, the pair were well on their way to repairing their friendship. They called a truce and agreed to look ahead, rather than dwelling on the past. That was just as well because Reddit had a proposal for them. With Ohanian busy pursuing his freelance commitments and a romantic relationship with tennis star Serena Williams, the company’s board decided to offer Huffman the position of CEO. After his acceptance in July 2015, they brought Ohanian on board as an advisor. But there wasn’t time to celebrate being reunited at their old company. By this stage, Reddit was a mess, and Huffman, in particular, had his work cut out for him. Projects had run over budget, morale was low and his appointment was met with a huge number of resignations. But Huffman still cherished Reddit and was determined to turn things around. On his fifth day in charge, he announced his intention to revise the site’s offensive content policy. “Neither I nor Alexis,” he stated, “created Reddit to be a bastion of free speech.” In the future, content glorifying violence and harm against people and animals would be forbidden. Big changes like that were tough to push through, but they paid off. Thanks to Ohanian and Huffman’s steadying hands, the company raised $200 million in investment funding in 2017, bringing the site’s value up to $1.8 billion. At the time of writing, Reddit is the sixth most-viewed website in the United States. The key message in these blinks: Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman managed to spin $12,000 and someone else’s idea into the lasting internet sensation that is now Reddit from their pizza box-filled college dorm room. Reddit’s rise wasn’t always smooth sailing, however. Marred by a toxic internal culture and hateful online communities, its seen its fair share of controversies. But that didn’t stop it from becoming one of the world’s most popular sites and a treasure trove of online culture. Actionable advice: Don’t be fooled by companies’ self-presentation. Reddit is a great example of a company whose cheery self-image masks something much darker. The next time you need to evaluate a company – for a job interview, say, or an investment opportunity – remember that appearances easily deceive and still waters run deep. Got feedback?

Indeed, algorithms are everywhere. They guide our social media feeds and sift the advertisements we see. And they also influence human life in many other ways; often, they now dictate which jobs and schools we have access to. You might think that decisions – about hiring, about admissions – would be much fairer if based on objective calculations rather than on someone’s gut feeling. After all, algorithms judge everyone on the same scale, right? Well, as you’ll learn in these blinks, the situation is a bit more complex than that. You’ll also find out why manipulating Facebook feeds can improve voter turnout; how an algorithm used to rank US universities increased tuition by 500 percent; and why Florida drivers with flawless driving records pay higher premiums than drunk drivers.   In many ways, the internet helps democracy. It’s a public platform that supports independent voices. But that same platform is also open to powerful propaganda machines that can manipulate the conversation. Research has shown that social media and search engines are especially vulnerable to algorithms that can influence the decisions of unsuspecting users. Researchers Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson found proof of this after asking undecided voters in the United States and India to find information about a handful of different political candidates. The catch was that the voters were told to use a specific search engine, unaware that it had been programmed with an algorithm that favored one candidate over all the others. As a result, the participants showed a 20-percent shift toward voting for the algorithm's preferred choice. A similar study happened on Facebook just prior to the 2012 elections: Solomon Messing, of the Pew Research Center, designed a special algorithm that would generate the news feeds of two million users and favor political news over all other posts. Facebook surveyed the participants before and after the elections, and the results showed that 3 percent more users turned out to vote than was expected before the algorithm had been adjusted to favor politics. While we can’t know for sure whether certain search-engine or social-media algorithms are designed to influence users, it is clear that there is vast potential for abuse. It is also clear that political candidates are well aware of their power to garner votes. Heading into the 2012 elections, Obama had a team of data analysts who interviewed thousands of voters and used their answers, in addition to demographic and consumer data, to create mathematical profiles. These profiles were then used to find similar people on national databases. Based on the profiles, they could assume that people with similar interests and backgrounds would also share the same political views.  Once people with similar data were grouped together, the analysts could create algorithms that made sure these groups received specifics ads that would appeal to their tastes. So those who showed evidence of having environmental concerns, for instance, were targeted for ads that highlighted Obama’s environmental policies. Predicting future crimes sounds like something out of a Philip K. Dick science-fiction story, but it is, in fact, part of today’s reality. Police departments are using algorithms to target prospective criminals. But this software is far from perfect, and the algorithms have led to cities being unevenly policed and certain people being unfairly singled out. How has this happened? The algorithms rely on historical data to pinpoint where crimes are most likely to occur, and it’s the police who determine which data is fed into the algorithm. Part of the problem is that the police tend to focus on specific kinds of crimes, such as “nuisance crimes,” which include vagrancy and certain drug-related offenses. Given that crimes like these tend to occur in poor neighborhoods, the analysis will end up being completely skewed toward these parts of the city. As a result, the police send the majority of their patrol units to the streets of poor neighborhoods, making the residents feel unfairly targeted. This also leads to neglect of wealthier neighborhoods, which become more vulnerable to criminal activity. Similar built-in biases skew the data that police use to predict potential violent crimes as well, leading to innocent people getting labeled as dangerous. In 2009, the Chicago Police Department received a grant to develop new crime-prediction software. They used that money to develop an algorithm that came up with a list of the 400 people most likely to be involved in a homicide. One of those people was Robert McDaniel, a 22-year-old who became the focus of police attention. One day, in 2013, a police officer even visited McDaniel’s home to let him know that the police had their eyes on him. But McDaniel was never charged with any crime. He ended up being red-flagged by the algorithm solely based on the people he follows on social networks and the criminals who happen to live in his neighborhood. In short, growing up in a poor neighborhood is all it takes to get you labeled as potentially dangerous. To be fair, crime prediction algorithms are designed to protect people, but they can very easily make people’s lives worse than they were before. As we’ll see in the next blink, a similar problem is plaguing the insurance business. If you’re familiar with insurance agencies, you might be aware that they’ll ask different clients to pay different premiums. And, no, they don’t just do this at random. They use the specific data they’ve collected on their customers. For car insurance, algorithms are used to calculate payment amounts based on how many prior accidents a customer has been in as well as their prior credit reports. In fact, in some areas, those credit reports are given more weight than a customer’s driving record. Such is the case in Florida, where adults with clean driving records and poor credit reports end up paying an average of $1,552 more per year than drivers with excellent credit and a history of drunk driving. This leads to poor drivers with impeccable driving skills having to pay more for insurance than rich drivers. And so begins the vicious cycle: By being forced to pay more for insurance, cash-strapped families will be more likely to miss a payment on another bill and worsen their credit score even further. And then, when their current insurance expires, the rate on their next contract will go up even higher, even if they haven’t broken a single traffic rule. Some insurance companies are even using algorithms to calculate the likelihood that a customer will shop around for cheaper prices. The insurance company Allstate does this by using a model that employs consumer and demographic data. If the algorithm suggests that a customer is likely to search for lower prices, they’ll offer them a reduced price, sometimes as large as 90 percent off the average rate. However, if a customer isn’t likely to shop around, his rate can increase by as much as 800 percent. But what Allstate’s algorithm is really doing is taking advantage of poor people without formal education, since this is the demographic that is less likely to shop around for other options. It can be difficult to spot the best workers out of a pool of hundreds of applicants. So it makes sense to use a variety of tests, in combination with the help of data companies, to sort through the results. But these tests have proven to be restrictive for certain kinds of people, especially when it comes to personality tests, which have made it next to impossible for someone like Kyle Behm to get a job. Behm had to drop out of his classes at Vanderbilt University to get treatment for his bipolar disorder. But in 2012, he was healthy enough to start looking for a part-time job. So he applied to Kroger, a supermarket chain, after a friend told Behm that there was an open position. When he was turned down, he checked with his friend, who told him that he’d been “red-lighted” due to the results of his personality test: the algorithm had tagged Behm as “likely to underperform.” Unfortunately, the same thing happened to Behm at all the other minimum-wage jobs he applied for. So, with the help of his father, he filed a lawsuit against seven different companies under the Americans with Disabilities Act. As of 2016, the suit was still pending. Part of the problem is that the companies handling the data can make some troubling mistakes. When Catherine Taylor applied for a job with the Red Cross in Arkansas, she was rejected and told that it was due to her criminal charge for intent to manufacture and sell methamphetamine. This seemed odd to Catherine since she had a pretty clean record. When she investigated further, she found that those charges belonged to another Catherine Taylor who happened to have the same birthday. She also discovered that it was the company providing the data to the Red Cross that had made the mistake, which prompted her to do a little more research. In the end, Catherine discovered that at least ten data brokers had made the same mistake, linking her to a serious crime that she’d never committed. It’s no secret that colleges in the United States have gotten quite expensive over the past 30 years, but few people know that one of the main reasons for the increase in tuition is due to one newspaper. In the 1980s, US News and World Report began using an algorithm that ranked the quality of US colleges using data that they believed would determine their success, such as SAT scores and acceptance rates. Suddenly, these ranking became crucially important for all the universities involved, and they all set out to improve their performance in the areas that the US News algorithm used. But to do that, they needed resources. This scramble for money is largely responsible for tuition going through the roof. Between 1985 and 2013, the cost of higher education increased by 500 percent. These rankings weren’t the only factor that contributed to this increase, but they certainly encouraged the schools to raise their costs. One of the most damaging things US News did was to include acceptance rates in their formula, as it completely ruined the concept of a “safety school.” Traditionally, a safety school was a college that had a high acceptance rate, and would serve as a good backup plan for a student who was also applying to a more prestigious school like Harvard or Yale. But since US News gave schools with a lower acceptance rate a better position in the rankings, many schools began lowering their rates and sending out fewer acceptance letters. In order to keep their actual enrollment numbers the same, they had to choose which students they were going to reject. By looking at their numbers, the safety schools could see that only a small percentage of the top students would choose them over the prestigious schools, so they believed that rejecting them wouldn't do any harm. But even if only some of these high-performing students chose to attend, it would have benefitted the school. Also, the decision to reject high performers out of hand ruined the backup plans of many good students. Like all the other algorithms we looked at, what started out as a good idea ended up doing far more harm than good. The key message in this book: Algorithms were initially created to be neutral and fair by avoiding all-too-human biases and faulty logic. However, many of the algorithms used today, from the insurance market to the justice system, have incorporated the very prejudices and misconceptions of their designers. And since these algorithms operate on a massive scale, these biases lead to millions of unfair decisions.  Actionable advice: Write machine-friendly resumes.

Machines can already help us manage our lives, but the digital products of the future will go a step further by taking all of our data and doing our jobs in a better, more efficient and more accurate way than we ever could. The idea of this automated future can be anxiety-inducing. But history tells us that we’ll still have jobs to do when all is said and done – we’ll just have to deal with less tedious busywork. What you need to worry about now is how to get yourself and your business ready for the inevitable, and not be left in the dust of the progress that is already knocking at the door. In these blinks, you’ll find out how data is like coal; what “instrumenting” is and why your business should be doing it now; and why the smartphone is only the tip of the iceberg. Does it ever feel like you have more employment worries than ever before? These days, it can seem like there’s a new trend emerging every day that threatens our jobs and brings us closer to bowing before our robot overlords. Now, you might think these are new anxieties. But the fact is, we’ve been at this crossroads before. You can look back at history books or old business pages of any newspaper and see that workers have been feeling threatened by “new machines” for centuries. The only thing that’s changed is the type of machine prompting these worries. For example, during the first industrial revolution in the nineteenth century, workers in England, calling themselves the Luddites, destroyed the mechanical looms being introduced to the textile industry. The Luddites believed these machines were threatening their jobs – and sure enough, the machines did replace them. Also during the early nineteenth century, 80 percent of US workers had a job in agriculture. But that figure has dropped to less than 2 percent due to the machines that perform the major tasks associated with farming, tending to livestock and toiling the land. Therefore, in 2013, when a study at Oxford University predicted that half of all American jobs were under threat of being automated over the next decade, people were right to be concerned. But what about the optimists who argue that computers are making us more productive? Unfortunately, the statistics tell a different story. Despite the billions invested in the consumer technology of smartphones and apps, as well as business-minded hardware and software of PCs and databases, productivity hasn’t changed much. Plus, when you compare the increase in annual wages in the United States from 1991 to 2012, it was roughly half the increase that took place between 1970 and 1990. So what does all this add up to? Let’s keep digging and find out. Over the past few decades, the automation of the industrial workplace has been continuous. The massive factories that were once filled with people are now running on row after row of machines. However, even though the factory floors have 90 percent fewer people on them, it doesn’t mean that every worker has to worry about losing his or her job. This is because technology has routinely created new jobs as much as it takes them away. Based on the dozens of studies the authors analyzed, we can expect around 12 percent of US jobs to be automated over the next ten years, displacing around 19 million workers. But these same studies also predict that these technologies should create 21 million new jobs, which would keep the unemployment figures of 2025 about the same as they are today. If these figures seem overly optimistic, you should keep in mind that jobs have a history of being created even in the harshest of economic conditions. In the years following the economic crisis of 2009, the private sector in the United States still managed to create 15 million jobs. What’s also important to understand is that automation technology is likely to take away specific tasks related to a job, but not necessarily the job itself. And this may not be such a bad thing after all. Studies conducted by Forrester Research found that robots will eliminate the portions of jobs that are generally considered dull and repetitive, such as the homework grading that teachers currently have to do. By removing these mindless tasks, workers would be free to give their other duties more attention, thereby improving the overall quality of their work. So, automation isn’t going to take away a teacher’s job; rather, it’ll make the teacher more effective. If you’ve ever used Uber, you may have marveled at the way one app can connect you with a car, provide you with a rating, charge your debit card and e-mail you an invoice, all in a matter of seconds. In fact, most people will embrace a new technology like Uber without ever stopping to consider how it all works. So let’s take a closer look. At the heart of Uber is the same “new machine” technology that keeps Facebook, Google and Instagram running, and it’s commonly known as a system of intelligence. What makes this new machine so special is a new kind of software that has the ability to recognize patterns and improve itself over time. For example, Facebook’s software can recognize a pattern in the items a user clicks on and then populate her feed with similar items. Given that Facebook has billions of users logging on each day, it would be impossible for employees to do this job manually. Instead, they can do more thoughtful work while Facebook’s system of intelligence gathers users’ information based on their activities. Then, Facebook can use that knowledge to provide users with what they hope will be relevant advertising and friend suggestions. These systems of intelligence are necessary primarily because of the massive amounts of data the internet generates. In the days before Uber, a normal transaction with a taxi probably entailed three “data points:” a record of your call to the dispatcher to request the cab, the driver making a note of picking you up and dropping you off and then the cost of the trip. With Uber there’s a wealth of data, including the details of your request, where you made the request from, what device you used to make the request, the route that was taken, how long the trip took, how much you tipped the driver and the rating you gave them. Now imagine this data being multiplied by the 2 billion trips that Uber has facilitated so far, and you have a small glimpse at the treasure trove of data that a system of intelligence thrives upon. By finding patterns in all this data, businesses can gain valuable insights into past and future customers, and better understand how their product can provide what users want, like and will pay for. When you look back on history, you can see how every industrial revolution was launched by the abundance of a new raw material, such as steel, coal or oil. This time, the raw material is data. And just like before, organizations are competing to prosper in this revolution by effectively mining and refining the resource into something meaningful that gives them a competitive advantage. But in order to turn your company’s data into something meaningful, you need a good business analyst.   Today, the field of business analytics is about using tools, processes and techniques to transform reams of data into insights that a company can use to take action and make profits or solve business problems. Research conducted by the authors’ consultancy, the Cognizant Center for the Future of Work, shows just how valuable business analytics can be. Organizations that are better than their competitors at gaining insights from their data can reduce business costs by an average of 8 percent while increasing their revenue by an average of 8 percent. To guarantee that your business analysts have good data to work with, you should gather that data from every possible product, service and source in your organization – a process called instrumenting. For example depending on how old you are, you may or may not remember a time when phones couldn’t store numbers or keep track of calls. If today’s phones are considered smart, then these old models could be called dumbphones. The authors believe that, by 2025, we’ll look back at today’s desks, shoes, toothbrushes and doors as being a lot like the dumbphone. We’ll be amazed that there was a time when these things didn’t help us perform our tasks more efficiently. In other words, we’re on the brink of a smart-product transformation, where miniature data collectors will be installed in just about everything we use. So now’s the time to get ahead of the curve by instrumenting everything in your organization, harvesting all possible data and finding the intrinsic value in every aspect of your business. After all, a smartphone is far more valuable than a dumbphone. Whatever your industry might be, chances are that Silicon Valley is getting ready to disrupt it, armed with systems of intelligence and fueled by big data. At this point, you might be thinking, “no problem, I’m already collecting all my data and putting it to good use.” However, if you’re going to defend your business from these marauding start-ups, you’ll need to get your hands on one other tool they already have at their disposal: a digital business model. First of all, it’s important to understand that a business model refers to two things: how your organization is structured and the processes your organization oversees in order to compete and generate revenue. For example, when it comes to banks and making loans, the organization and processes are built around how best to receive an application, determine if it qualifies and either approve or decline it. Now, the longer your product or service has been around, the more likely your business model is structured around piles of paper being shuffled around from one person to the next, in a maze of cubicles and endless rows of filing cabinets. The paper-based business model is outdated, particularly in the eyes of the millennial generation, who expect to open an app and get an answer right away, rather than wait for paperwork to make its way through the cubicle convolution. For traditional businesses, the answer has been to meet the new generation halfway by creating a part-physical and part-digital business model. Airlines, for example, still deal with many of the physical processes of getting passengers and their luggage from one location to another, but many of the in-flight experiences, as well as flight operations, are being handled through a digitized model. So, when moving to a digital business model, the question arises: what can you automate? Start by looking around your office and making note of what exactly everyone is doing. The truth is, many “white-collar” administrative tasks can, and will, become automated soon enough, and this revolution will change what countless people around the world will be doing on weekdays between the hours of nine to five. In some offices, automation has already been quietly taking over tasks, particularly in the field of journalism. Believe it or not, there’s a good chance you’ve already been reading newspaper articles written by robots. Traditional news sources like the Washington Post and USA Today, as well as online news sources like Yahoo!, have all begun publishing automated content. Companies like Narrative Science and Automated Insight have already developed software that can write real-estate listings, local weather forecasts and articles recapping last night’s football matches. As of 2017, the Associated Press publishes around 20,000 automated articles per year, and as time goes by this software is only going to get better at writing nuanced, human-like prose. Like newspapers and print media, the answer for how your business should start moving toward a digital business model may lie in the back office, since this lies outside the area of customer service. The back office refers to where a company’s core operations take place, like the human resources and finance offices. Departments like these are perfect for automation, since they’re where a lot of data is collected and a lot of numbers are crunched into meaningful information. Every business has to start somewhere, and if you hope to stay ahead of the curve and avoid scrambling to catch up, the time to start automating is now. The key message in this book: There’s a new industrial revolution coming, and the instrument at its core is a system of intelligence powered by self-learning software and massive amounts of data. This new technology will make it possible for many tasks to be automated – but rather than eliminating jobs, this can both create jobs and free up time for employees to improve the quality of their work. The businesses that will succeed in the future will be the ones that integrate automation and self-learning software into their business models, and make the most of their data to gain a competitive advantage. Actionable advice: Look for ways to put your company out of business. Many businesses have employees that live “Sunday evening, Monday morning” lives. While they’re away from work, they’ll use apps and modern technology to shop, socialize and manage their personal finances; but then they’ll return to a job that pretends nothing has changed in the past 20 years. Don’t let this kind of charade go on at your company. Instead, have your employees help design your company’s future by having each one come up with five new products or services that would put your company out of business.

After decades of hype, artificial intelligence is showing signs that it might be close to reaching human levels of intelligence. Nanotechnology is giving us greater control of our bodies, and genetic editing puts us on the verge of replacing natural selection with human selection. Quantum computing and big data analytics offer the tantalizing prospect of solving some of life’s most profound mysteries, from the existence of extraterrestrial life to the inner workings of the human brain. Where Will Man Take Us? shows how technology is rapidly bringing us into a new epoch in human life. It explores some of the difficult societal, moral and economic questions posed by technology change and it considers whether our future as humans is likely to be immortality – or extinction. In these blinks, you’ll learn how tiny robots will soon patrol your body and maintain your health; why self-driving cars need to be taught ethics; and how, within a century, our bodies may be transferable devices, and our minds uploaded to the cloud. In 1997, Deep Blue, an IBM supercomputer, beat the legendary chess player Gary Kasparov in a six-game series. It was a major step forward for artificial intelligence. But it was possible because chess is a relatively finite game, based on clear rules. Teach a machine the rules, and you can teach it to win. So far, artificial intelligence has been good at performing individual tasks like playing chess. It can, as Apple’s Siri demonstrates, learn to understand your voice and follow commands; it can even translate one language into another. But so far, it hasn’t learned to replicate wider human intelligence effectively. Things that come naturally to us, like intuition or creativity, remain difficult for machines. That’s starting to change, however, as the game Go shows us. Go is a fantastically complicated two-player board game in which you try to surround more territory than your competitor. At any given time in a game of chess, there is an average of 35 possible moves available. In Go, there are 250. There are 361 squares on a Go grid, compared to 64 in chess, and an incredible 10170 potential board configurations. That’s too many to really comprehend, but for perspective, it’s far more than the number of atoms in our universe. So when you play Go, you have to rely more on human intuition and feel than logical, rule-based decisions. It just isn’t possible to do all the calculations. That’s why when AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence created by Google’s DeepMind research unit, beat Lee Sedol, a top player of the game, it was clear that we’re on the cusp of major advances. But how did AlphaGo succeed? Well, DeepMind gave it a collection of 30 million moves collected from human players and then trained it to play. The machine was then programmed for reinforcement learning, which mimics the way that our brains work. That meant that the artificial intelligence collected points when it did something that proved to be correct and lost them when it made mistakes. Then DeepMind trained AlphaGo against different versions of itself. Each time it played a game, it would learn by remembering which move brought it a reward, creating a cycle of improvement. Observers of AlphaGo commented that its moves were inventive, with seasoned players even describing some as “divine.” Clearly, machines are becoming more human, developing intuition and creativity. Rather than being programmed, as with the rules of chess, they are teaching themselves to learn. And this shift is getting faster. Pluck a single hair from your head. It’s not very wide, is it? But in nano-terms, it’s huge. A single nanometer is about one ten-thousandth of its width. That’s the kind of scale we’re talking about when we talk about nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is created at the scale of single atoms or molecules. But while it is truly small, its impact on our health and on our lives will be nothing short of transformative. That’s partly because nanoscience allows us to exploit the fact that, at the level of single atoms or molecules, materials have different properties. Among other things, this means they can have greater strength and less weight. So, for example, carbon nanotubes, microscopic tubes made up of carbon atoms, generate incredibly strong materials. A stack of around a hundred sheets of carbon nanotubes – together still thinner than a millimeter – is strong enough to take a bullet, enabling the creation of ultra-thin and lightweight bulletproof vests. But nanotechnology is most interesting for what it might enable us to do to our own bodies. Developments in computing and sensors on the nanoscale mean we will soon be able to fight disease and keep ourselves in tip-top condition with the help of nanorobots. Imagine a near future in which nanorobots are constantly patrolling your circulatory system. Roaming your blood, they will be able to attack viruses, bacteria and other disease-carrying bodies. For example, researchers have developed a nanotechnology delivery system for an anti-cancer agent called tumor necrosis factor alpha. The system’s nanorobots would float through the bloodstream, dispensing the agent when required and evading the threat of any pathogens seeking to attack them. Nanotechnology will also help us manage long-term conditions. Patients with diabetes might soon have nanorobots in their bloodstreams, constantly measuring their blood nutrient levels and giving them a boost of the right chemicals at the right time. In Indian mythology, the gods sailed the oceans searching for an elixir of immortality; the Greeks talked of an elusive elixir of life. Well, maybe we are about to stumble across a modern-day panacea in the form of nanotechnology that gives us the power to control our health. Combine that with the power of genetic coding, and we have the power to play God. Let’s take a look. At Cambridge University in 1962, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of the DNA molecule: A double helix structure of phosphates and sugars, held together by four different organic molecules. Built into this structure is a kind of code, one that spells out the biological blueprint of who we will become, from the color of our skin to our risk of hereditary disease. In a sense, our DNA is our programming. And just as we can analyze the code in which computers are programmed, we can now read, analyze and manipulate our DNA. Today, many companies offer to test every one of the 22,000 genes that make you who you are. Such testing gives an analysis of everything, from what percentage Neanderthal you are to your genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s. People are starting to take this seriously. You may recall actress Angelina Jolie’s decision to have a double mastectomy in 2013. Well, that was based on genetic analysis which revealed an 87 percent probability that she would develop breast cancer within 14 years, enabling her to take preventative action. And today’s technology allows us to take a step further in our attempts to prevent disease: editing our genes. Oddly enough, we owe this ability to scientists at a Danish dairy company, Danisco. Looking for ways to control the viruses attacking the good bacteria in their cheeses and yogurts, the scientists discovered something called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR. When the bacteria’s DNA was attacked by viruses, the DNA deployed CRISPR to identify its assailant and then literally cut it out of the genetic code. The virus was then replaced with healthy code. Think of CRISPR as a pair of molecular scissors and you can start to see its potential. Use it to cut out the parts of our DNA that encode genetic diseases, like cystic fibrosis, for example, and you can prevent those diseases completely. The consequences are profound. To date, our evolution has been based on natural selection. But now, human selection – the ability to dictate our own evolution – lies before us. And with it come profound ethical questions with no clear answers. May a bereaved parent clone his lost child? Why don’t we all evolve to run like Usain Bolt? As we’ll see in the next few blinks, technological advances are creating all sorts of areas in which we have no clear view of the way forward for society. Our lives are increasingly being recorded by sensors, cameras and connected devices. Fragmented across cyberspace is a digital avatar of you. What you like to watch on TV, which shows you never finished. What you like to eat, what you buy, when and where. Your political views and who your friends are. But no one has the whole picture. And that is part of the problem. Our data is not only our own, but worse, it lies in fragments with multiple different organizations around the world. The fragmentary nature of your data is helpful to the likes of Facebook. They can make money on the pieces of incomplete data they hold on you by selling it to advertisers. But the fact that the data is incomplete can cause problems. For example, for a long time after the author visited Vietnam, advertisers continued to bombard him with ads for vacations in that country. Because their information was incomplete, they didn’t realize that he wasn’t thinking about a vacation to Vietnam – he’d already been there and returned. Instead of relevant, the ads were just annoying. A better approach would involve more sharing and a single, coherent data model for each person. The author calls it the Me Model. This would be a true and complete digital profile that pulled together all data about you in one place. The bars you frequent. Your health and exercise data from Fitbit. Your hospital records. Your Google and Netflix histories. All stored in a single system that uses artificial intelligence to maintain the best possible, most up-to-date digital version of you. The Me Model offers several major advantages. Firstly, it belongs to you, giving you complete control over what you share and with whom you share it. Secondly, while today private companies can use your data for their benefit; with the Me Model, you can monetize your own data. Why would an advertiser pay Facebook for a fragmented, incomplete set of data when you could sell them the full set? Whatever you feel about the use of your private data, the reality is that we now live in a data-driven economy. Your data is out there. Increasingly, it defines who you are. Wouldn’t you rather take control of it? Roughly 150 years ago, the Industrial Revolution swept the world, sparking major increases in wealth and productivity. But it also wrought huge social changes, as agricultural workers made the painful transition to factory work and city life. Today, we are living through a new revolution, and whether you call it the digital revolution or the Artificial Intelligence Age, it’s likely to transform our lives totally. Artificial intelligence and technology will have a huge impact on the way we work and, possibly, on whether we work at all. According to Kevin Kelly, founding editor of Wired magazine, 65 percent of the jobs out there today won’t exist in the next ten to 15 years. Whether you’re a laborer or a lawyer, a tailor or a translator, the current wave of automation threatens your livelihood. Now, history is full of people worrying about technology taking away jobs, and yet most of us are still employed. In nineteenth-century Britain, a group of textile workers called the Luddites protested new manufacturing techniques for taking away their jobs. But what those techniques really led to was seamstresses gaining new skills and jobs and textile costs coming down. Sure, there was some short-term pain. But technology created new roles just as it destroyed old ones, and it made everyone richer in the long run. In the new age of artificial-intelligence-powered growth, though, the results of growth may not be shared equally. Consider the difference between two hugely successful businesses, Instagram and Kodak. When Kodak was at its peak, it provided a livelihood for 145,000 people and their families. By contrast, when Facebook acquired Instagram for $12 billion in 2012, Instagram had just 12 employees in total. And Instagram isn’t unique; two years later, Facebook paid $19 billion for Whatsapp, which had 400 million users but only 55 employees. So, it’s possible that the lessons of the past will no longer apply in the future. Our current economic revolution could lead to far more Instagrams and far fewer Kodaks. Consequently, we might see a growing gulf between a tiny but super-rich elite and an increasingly jobless middle class. To deal with these problems, we need to consider new ideas. Like universal basic income, for example, which the state would use to provide all citizens with enough money on which to live. If our governments can respond to these challenges intelligently, then we may all benefit; if they get it wrong, we face a difficult road ahead. In March 2018, an autonomously driven Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman, making her the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car. This immediately raised a difficult question: Who is to blame in this case? The owner, for owning the car and using it for its intended purpose? The manufacturer of the car? The company that built the software that controls it? As “smart” machines become more and more a part of our daily lives, the question of how we regulate and control them becomes greater. Some of these are practical questions. For instance, how do we prevent robots from being hacked and misused? IOActive, a firm of security consultants, has demonstrated how real this risk is by hacking into and taking control of Alpha 2, a humanoid robot designed to be a household assistant. They instructed it to pick up a screwdriver and repeatedly stab a tomato. And what about morals – should we encode them into robots? If so, whose morals? Science fiction offers a good starting place for considering this question. The famous science fiction writer Isaac Asimov proposed, as long ago as 1942, three laws for robots. First, a robot must not injure a human or allow one to come to harm. Second, a robot must obey its orders, except where they would conflict with the first law. Third, a robot should protect itself, as long as that protection does not go against either of the first two laws. These three laws are a good start, but they provide no clear guidance for some of the thorny situations a machine might face. Consider again a self-driving car that sees a pedestrian step out unexpectedly into the street. It has to make what is essentially a moral choice. It can swerve dangerously to protect the pedestrian but risk its owner’s life. Or it can prioritize its owner’s safety at the expense of the pedestrian’s. Does a self-driving vehicle have a loyal duty to protect its owner? And if so, do taxis and public transit vehicles behave differently to privately owned cars? And should a vehicle’s calculations change if the pedestrian is a child or an elderly person? It will take some time for us to come to grips with questions like these. In the meantime, here’s some advice. Be nice to machines. In the long run, it might pay to stay in their good books. We’ve explored some of the problems that our technological revolution is throwing up. Now, let’s consider some of the excitement that awaits us. There are around seven sextillion, or 1021, stars in the whole universe, each with their own planets, just like our sun. Do we really believe that intelligent life has evolved nowhere else but here? It’s statistically likely that life exists elsewhere in the universe. But if that’s the case, why haven't we encountered it? One theory is the Zoo hypothesis, formulated in 1973 by astronomer John A. Ball. According to Ball, one or more alien societies exist – it’s just that they’re watching us from afar, as we observe animals in a zoo. In this theory, extraterrestrials are intelligent enough to recognize an independent natural evolution and sensitive enough not to disturb it. If that seems unlikely, consider that we try to allow tribal peoples such as the Jarawas, in the Indian Andaman Islands, to live undisturbed by contact with modern societies. Another theory is that we simply wouldn’t recognize contact if it was made. According to the famous whistleblower Edward Snowden, all intelligent societies come to encrypt their communications. It may be, he argues, that alien messages are out there, but we are incapable of telling them apart from the background noise of cosmic radiation. The good news, however, is that our advances in science and technology may mean that we’re getting closer to solving this mystery. The Breakthrough Listen project at the University of California, Berkeley is dedicated to listening for extraterrestrial communication. In 2015, the artificial intelligence the project uses to analyze cosmic noise picked up on a series of repeated radio bursts coming from a galaxy three billion light years from Earth. It was thought at first that these bursts resulted from a catastrophic event like the death of a star. But the bursts appeared again in both 2016 and 2017. That means that whatever caused them had lived on. Scientists believe that the source could be an extraterrestrial intelligence that existed three billion years in the past – a time when we were just single-celled organisms. That huge gulf of time between us points to the fact that, even if we ever saw extraterrestrial life, we might not recognize it. Life on different planets may no longer resemble life as we understand it. These beings might have merged their biology with technology, resulting in life forms that exist only as information. That, after all, may very well be the next step in our own evolution. And it could happen sooner than you think. The futurist Ray Kurzweil takes more vitamins and minerals than your average 70-year-old, popping around 200 pills a day. Why? Because he believes that, by the middle of this century, humans will become immortal. And naturally, he’s determined to still be alive at the time. Kurzweil isn’t some old crank but a recognized expert in artificial intelligence, the future and the singularity. That’s the point in the future when artificial intelligence becomes artificial super intelligence, when machines are learning so fast they far exceed human capabilities and generate repetitive self-improvement at an explosive, exponential pace. This time may be upon us soon – Kurzweil predicts the singularity will come in 2045. We can’t know for sure what path machines or humanity will take after the singularity. One rather bleak possibility is our extinction. How could that happen? It could be a simple mistake. Consider a medical artificial intelligence designed to eradicate cancers that decides that the best way to do so is to eliminate the host: humans. But it’s not all bleak. As legendary physicist Stephen Hawking has said, the singularity could be the worst thing to happen to humanity, but it could also be the best. That’s because it offers the tantalizing possibility of immortality. Transhumanists believe that the singularity will advance our understanding of the human brain so far that we will be able to achieve digital immortality as our bodies become temporary vessels for our digitalized minds, which will be stored in the cloud. At present, we don’t understand enough about how the physical cells of the brain become our conscious mind for this to be achievable. But Hawking believes that the brain is essentially a computer, and that, therefore, it will be possible one day to copy it and provide life after death. And Ray Kurzweil has noted that in the future we will be able to send millions of nanobot scanners through each capillary of our brain to scan its every neural feature. Take into account the vast, rapid advances in nanotechnology, in artificial intelligence and in data analysis that the singularity would bring, and living as an immortal digital consciousness doesn’t seem so unlikely after all. Today, we are essentially the same beings as our earliest ancestors who wandered the plains of Africa. After the singularity, everything will change. We will look on Homo sapiens and its intelligence as we today look back at Neanderthals. Ahead of us lies a great rupture in human existence and the possibility of a new, super-intelligent species. So for now, keep taking those vitamins. The key message in these blinks: Our mastery of technology is accelerating at an exponential pace. As a result, we face major societal, moral and economic questions while struggling to keep up with the impact of technological change. And soon, we must face the fact that what lies next for humanity is a new species. Moving past Homo sapiens, we will merge human and artificial intelligence to create a conscious, super-intelligent and maybe even immortal human.  Got feedback?

If you managed to land a job you liked and did your work satisfactorily, chances were that you could count on keeping it until retirement. This is no longer the case. Today, more and more things are becoming decentralized – information, corporations, even currencies. And with decentralization comes unpredictability; holding down a job for life is nearly impossible. So what are you supposed to do in this new environment where the old rules no longer apply? That’s what these blinks are here to help you with. Part roadmap to today’s changeable workplace terrain and part handbook for how to navigate it, these blinks will equip you with the tools you need to stay flexible and innovative. You’ll also find out how nylon is a product of disobedience; why it’s better to be a reed than an oak; and why science is far from infallible.   If you throw a baseball up in the air, it’s going to come down, right? Or what if you fly north in an airplane with limitless fuel? Well, you’ll eventually come back to where you took off. So why do these answers seem so commonsensical? Well, it’s because they chime with our current paradigm – that is, the worldview that underlies our theories about how things should function. Part of that paradigm is gravity, which causes airborne balls to return to earth and prevents airplanes from floating off into space. But, as the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn points out, paradigms can shift. Paradigm shifts entirely revolutionize commonly held beliefs. And since people will defend their beliefs at almost any cost, these shifts are usually strongly resisted. Even most scientists will defend current paradigms. For instance, before the Copernican Revolution in the sixteenth century, it was believed that the sun orbited the earth, and many scientists continued to believe this for decades, despite clear evidence to the contrary. But nonscientific paradigms exist as well, and are often just as ingrained. Each age comes with a different set of social assumptions and theories. According to the French philosopher Michel Foucault, people have certain systems of norms and beliefs that dictate their actions. These systems change over time, and every generation has its own. As in science, they usually don’t change without vigorous resistance. The unquestioning acceptance of current paradigms, plus a resistance to paradigm shifts, has prevented the acknowledgment of history's greatest innovations. Take Louis and Auguste Lumière, the brothers who developed the first “living photographs” – later known as motion pictures – in 1895. Audiences were initially captivated by the moving images. But it only took a few years for the novelty to wear off, prompting one of the brothers to declare that “the cinema is an invention without any future.” Consequently, the brothers opted to focus on color photography. So why could neither the brothers nor the audience see the true potential of this new medium? Well, they were committed to an old paradigm, according to which photos were only capable of telling the story of a single moment, not spinning longer, complex tales. It didn’t even occur to them to transform pictures into the modern “film.” Do you ever feel like time is moving faster and faster, like the last year zipped by much more quickly than the year before it? Well, you might be onto something; a quick glance at earth’s history shows that the world is, in fact, changing at an unprecedented rate. To make this clearer, let’s imagine the history of earth as a single calendar year, with the formation of our planet occurring on January 1. It wasn’t until December 1 that the first land animals appeared. And it took until 11:50 p.m. on December 31 for our hominid ancestors to start walking upright. On New Year’s Eve, less than a second before midnight, recorded history begins. Now let’s reset the scale, and have January 1 be when hominids started walking upright. On this new calendar, mid-December marks the development of the first languages. On the morning of December 31, industrialization began, and later that same day, at around 07:00 p.m., the world population had grown to 3 billion. In the last few hours of human history, there have been countless life-changing innovations. We can now 3D-print prosthetic limbs and communicate instantaneously from anywhere on earth. It is a time of constant change – but this change goes hand in hand with unpredictability. Take climate change. For centuries, a society’s success depended on its ability to make accurate predictions about the weather. In the Middle Ages, for example, merchants who knew that harvests would be poor after an impending drought could, in dry times, stockpile wheat and sell it later at an inflated price. Now, our predictive abilities are being derailed by the climate change caused by rapid development and industrialization. Today, it’s getting harder for us to predict where destructive weather events will occur, or which regions will experience increases in temperature. In the future, unpredictable weather will only be more common, and reliable forecasts will become a thing of the past. It used to be that authorities ruled the roost. From royal families to spiritual leaders and politicians to major corporations, the people with the power called the shots. But this is about to change, and all because of the unprecedented access to information that we have today. Prior to the advent of the internet, the public had limited access to information – and this access was granted or denied by the people in power. By and large, the public accepted the information given to them; they obeyed orders and rarely challenged the official narrative. Today, however, the internet has made information available to virtually everyone, and the veracity of official claims can easily be scrutinized and challenged. Wikipedia perfectly embodies this new availability. It’s made it possible to look up anything – from the Napoleonic Wars to the history of Nigeria – in a matter of seconds and at no cost. Other platforms provide further educational resources. On edX.org, one can access lectures from a variety of international universities, and there are countless tutorial videos on YouTube, allowing you to brush up on almost any subject, from statistics to art history. The internet, and the free flow of information it encourages, are also fueling a phenomenon known as emergence. Emergence occurs when a system or organism is created whose whole is superior to the sum of its parts. Wikipedia is a perfect example. No single Wiki editor could have created such a comprehensive online resource. Even a select team of academics wouldn’t be able to do it in a lifetime. What’s more, in Wikipedia’s case, emergence trumped authority. No one buys expensive encyclopedias anymore; rather, they turn to this autonomous community of information-loving writers who share what they know for free. Or consider the Arab Spring, which brought down autocratic governments by establishing social movements whose power far surpassed that of any small activist group. These movements took shape as people discussed and shared ideas on various online platforms, creating a massive uprising that would have been hard for one person to instigate. Emergence is even affecting the world of business. Crowdfunding has made it remarkably easy for people without personal wealth to transform fledgling ideas into successful businesses. Do you think you could predict which of the world’s ten most active volcanoes will erupt next? Sounds impossible, right? Well, it is. Nonetheless, many organizations still saddle a handful of their top people with a comparable responsibility: predicting which events (be it a natural disaster or a shift in the market) are most likely to occur, and then allocating resources accordingly. This method – putting resources where top people think they are most likely to be needed – is called the push approach. But this method is inflexible and sluggish. All feedback from lower-level employees must first move up through the tiers of management before it can be considered and acted upon. And only then can someone at the top address the issue. This drawn-out rigmarole can spell doom for a company that needs to react nimbly to an unexpected event. Just look at how Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Japanese government reacted to the Fukushima earthquake in 2016, which caused a leak at a nuclear power plant. No one at the top knew exactly how much radioactive material had leaked, or where exactly the leak was, and no equipment or technicians could be sent to deal with the problem until this information traveled up the chain of command. A pull strategy allows for considerably more flexible solutions. With this approach, resources and expertise are requested right when they’re needed, and requests are made by decision makers who are on-site and can react to whatever is happening on the ground. For this to work, there must also be a free flow of information between departments. After the Fukushima earthquake, Japanese officials, hobbled by their push approach to management, did a poor job of reorganizing resources, and the information they released on radiation levels was ambiguous and imprecise. So, a group of volunteers rallied online and, armed with self-made Geiger counters, set out to collect concrete radiation data. This information was later made public online, free of cost. Did you have a favorite activity as a child? Whatever it was, let’s imagine you liked to draw. What would have happened if, while at school, you refused to set aside your crayons when the bell rang for class? You likely would have been disciplined in some way. Now let’s imagine you’d been allowed to draw and had gone on to become the next Picasso . . . The point is that rules can suffocate possibility. If everyone went about their normative days in predictably normative ways, innovation would cease entirely. That’s why breaking the rules is sometimes better than following them. Today, companies need to be innovative. The alternative is to founder in the constant change and competition of the business world. All innovative companies are fueled by creative employees – and there’s nothing that kills creativity quite like a set of inflexible rules. Remember Thomas Kuhn, the philosopher of science who coined the term “paradigm shift”? Well, according to him, the people who question and dismantle old paradigms always have one thing in common: they pay no heed to what others tell them to do. Indeed, we have disobedience to thank for many great inventions. Have you ever heard of Wallace Hume Carothers? Back in 1926, he started studying polymers – complex molecules used to make fabrics – when working in DuPont’s first research department. In 1930, however, a new director took over the department and Carothers was told to focus solely on commercial uses for existing fabrics. But he disobeyed. He continued his work with synthetic polymers and, in 1935, he invented nylon, a groundbreaking fabric that, by 1941, had seized 30 percent of the US pantyhose market. And disobedience isn’t only a source of innovation; it’s inspiration as well. The term positive deviants, coined in the 1970s, describes people who disobey the rules and, in so doing, improve not only their own lives but the lives of those who follow their example. Some corporations, upon discovering that one of their employees is a positive deviant, have been able to harness this innovative rule-breaking and develop it into a change program that helps other employees foster their own creativity. Which plant do you think would stand a better chance of weathering every storm: an oak or a reed? Most people would choose that symbol of strength, the oak. But even an oak can be broken by a strong enough wind, whereas the reed, supple and slim, is certain to bounce back after the storm. Modern companies should do away with oak-like tendencies and try to be more flexible, like the reed. The organizations of yore did their utmost to build corporate muscle and then rely on that strength. And it worked. If processes and stocks and plans were strong enough, no turning of the tide could bring them down. But this has all changed. Today’s work environment is not what it was, in part because the people who want to bring businesses down are much wilier and more flexible. For instance, in 2010, malware was detected in Iranian nuclear facilities. The code tampered with the facilities’ centrifuges, causing them to require early replacement, and then covered up the damage by sending false information to the control system. Here’s where an old approach failed to forestall a modern problem: the system was thought to be safe because it wasn’t connected to the internet. Since data could only enter and exit the facility via USB sticks, there was little cybersecurity guarding the system. The facility was thought to be strong and safe – but it wasn’t. It’s much better for a company to be resilient than strong. In the face of failure, flexibility is crucial. For instance, when starting out, many of today’s companies have little money and few permanent employees. By keeping investments to a minimum, they can learn from mistakes and, if necessary, start over if they fold. Just take YouTube, which began as a video-dating platform called “Tune In Hook Up.” It wasn’t a success. But that didn’t matter because the founders identified a market demand: people needed an easy and fast way to share videos. And so, in 2005, they launched YouTube. One year later, they sold it to Google for $1.7 billion. The key message in this book: Everyone can learn to adapt to today’s dynamic and unpredictable work environment. Just remember that old paradigms can blind us to modern innovations, that the rules should sometimes be disobeyed and that flexibility and resilience trump strength and authority. It’s time to forget the old rules and start forging a set of your own. Actionable advice: Favor practice over theory. Here’s another business survival trick: embrace practice and let theory take a back seat. In fields like software development, the costs of innovation are so low that just making something is often cheaper than developing an elaborate plan. If it doesn’t pan out, you can simply start over and try again. It’s been reported that Google lets employees spend 20 percent of their work time experimenting on personal projects, a freedom that’s led to, among other innovations, the creation of Gmail.

Indeed, on a daily basis, we use services provided by online companies whose names have become synonymous with such changes. So what do Uber, Airbnb and Alibaba have in common, and where did they come from? Rachel Botsman has a startling answer. In her view, they’re each the result of a revolution in the way trust functions in our society. These blinks follow the evolution of trust. They take us on a journey from when trust only existed between small, tight-knit communities through to industrialized societies in which trust was a top-down affair between big institutions and citizens. Finally, we’ll arrive at our present age of horizontal trust between networked peers, armed with blockchains and rating systems. On the way, you’ll find out how Maghribi traders developed an original rating system in the eleventh century; why millions of us are happy to get into a stranger’s car; and how blockchain technology is set to revolutionize trust in the future. What is trust? It’s an everyday word we all know and use, but it’s a surprisingly tricky concept to pin down. We each have slightly different interpretations. Look closely enough, though, and you’ll find that virtually every definition shares a common theme. Trust opens the door to the world and expands our horizons. Take an average day. Without trust, it would be difficult to leave your home, let alone buy something from a stranger online. And imagine getting on a plane if you didn’t trust its ability to stay aloft. From using a credit card on eBay to flying somewhere for a holiday, our complex, interconnected world depends on trust at every turn. But trust is a two-way street. That’s why we’re most likely to trust others when we know that they have more to lose than to gain by betraying our trust. A good example of this is the trust system developed by Maghribi traders in the eleventh century and still used in the business world today. The traders faced a conundrum. They wanted to ship their goods to the profitable but distant markets of Sicily. That meant they had to use intermediaries. How could they make sure they weren’t being fleeced? The Maghribi entrepreneurs hit on a simple but effective solution. If their partners in Sicily showed themselves to be dishonest, they would be excluded from the traders’ business networks and lose out on future opportunities. By developing a system that cut both ways, the traders established a foundation of trust that allowed them to carry out their business and avoid being cheated. What the traders had invented was a rating system. It was a revolutionary innovation that is used to this day in the business world. And its modern version, as we’ll see in the following blinks, is becoming ever more important. Trust is – and always has been – the thing that makes the business world tick. But trust itself has changed throughout human history. Before our own age, there were two distinct periods. These can be defined as the age of local trust and the age of institutional trust. Local trust refers to the period before industrialization and the emergence of highly complex societies. In this age, people had close, face-to-face relations and trade was conducted within small, tight-knit communities. Industrialization changed everything. Trade and business were now conducted from ever-greater distances; loans and bonds circled the globe, transcending old boundaries and borders. Maintaining elaborate systems of credit and trade meant that institutions – banks, governments and courts – became increasingly important. They ensured stability and fair practice. These were the linchpins of the system of institutional trust. But the nature of trust has changed once again in our own global age. We are now entering an era of distributed trust. So what’s the difference? Distributed trust is a horizontal relationship between peers rather than a top-down relationship between institutions and citizens. Take Airbnb. When it comes to staying in a new city, we’re now much more likely to value the authentic experience provided by highly-rated hosts on Airbnb than the impersonal one of staying in a well-established, trusted institution such as a Hilton hotel. That’s an example of one of the many ways in which we’ve come to trust strangers in our lives. Generations of children were told by their parents to never get in the car of a stranger, but that’s precisely what millions of us do every day when our Ubers arrive! New eras can be scary, but they’re also moments of innovation. Think of paper money. We take it for granted now, but you can imagine how terrifying it must have seemed when barter – the direct exchange of a pot for a pig or a table for a chair, say – was replaced by pieces of paper that’d been assigned abstract values. But the new system opened up new possibilities. In order to get a pig, you didn’t need to have exactly what your fellow barterer wanted. You could sell your horse and use the money to buy multiple pigs at once. The new age of distributed trust is similar. Because we trust strangers with our credit card details when we go online, we now have access to more goods than ever before. We are increasingly moving away from institutional trust. Shocks like the 2008 financial crisis have amplified skepticism about the established institutions at the heart of our societies. The greed and chronic malpractice of the institutions that we trusted with our money became plain to see once the market crashed. But the crash of 2008 expedited a process that was already underway. Technological change had been sapping confidence in institutions for some time prior to the financial crisis. New technologies make life more transparent. And, before 2008, our eyes had been opened to how big institutions are really run, and we’d become much more attuned to their failings as a result. The internet continues to provide us with greater access to information about institutions. Wikileaks is a great example of this. Its exposés of the machinations of the powerful allowed every citizen to become a fly on the wall in the rooms where the fate of the world is decided. And what we now know isn’t pretty. The Panama Papers added to this. Released in 2016 by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in cooperation with the Guardian and Le Monde newspapers, the papers documented the elaborate tax-avoidance schemes of public figures ranging from the Argentinian soccer star Lionel Messi to the Russian president Vladimir Putin and the father of David Cameron, the former British prime minister. The revelations showed that the rules and laws by which most of us live do not seem to apply to the rich and powerful. If we don’t pay our taxes, we’re fairly certain to end up in hot water – but another rule applies to those who wield the greatest influence. No wonder we’ve become skeptical about institutions. But new technologies don’t just undermine institutional trust by revealing secrets. They can also distort the truth. Take social media. Poorly researched, sensationalist or simply false claims spread like wildfire through social-media channels, undermining traditional investigative reporting. Fake news articles are frequently shared by people who haven’t read them – let alone double-checked the content – simply because the headline reflects their worldview. Taken together, that amounts to a ferocious assault on the credibility of established institutions. The problem from the latter’s perspective is that rebuilding trust is exceptionally difficult. Once bitten, twice shy. Once misdeeds have been exposed, it’s hard for us to believe that the big institutions are acting properly. The sharing economy has changed the way we do business. The most successful representatives of the new ethos have broken with the old model of traditional outlets (selling goods and services) and instead focussed on connecting customers with peers online. Take Uber and Airbnb. Both companies allow their users to generate income from otherwise unused assets like cars and spare rooms by connecting them with their peers. Their success speaks for itself. Uber is now worth $68 billion and is larger than established multinational giants such as Deutsche Bank and FedEx. Airbnb is the second-largest hospitality company in the world, with a worth of $31 billion. But that’s nothing compared to the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. Founded by Jack Ma, in 1999, the platform connects suppliers, buyers and sellers in a virtual marketplace in which everything from galoshes to live goats can be bought. Alibaba has grown so dramatically that it even overtook Walmart in 2016. What do all these businesses have in common? They create mutual trust between their users. Online transactions are only viable if users know that there are rules that will protect them if something goes wrong. That’s why Ma’s Alibaba holds all transactions in escrow accounts until the buyer confirms receipt of their goods. Ma also fired some 100 workers and several executives after finding out that they’d been assisting unscrupulous vendors in bypassing the strict verification process. Knowing that there’s a support system in place allows us to take ever-larger trust leaps. Because we know we won’t be left high and dry, we’re willing to place trust in companies and our fellow users. But there’s another important factor that increases our trust, as we’ll find out in the next blink. Today’s technologies mean that betraying someone’s trust for short-term gain has negative long-term consequences. That’s because we all leave a reputation trail behind us. Other people can see how trustworthy we are by following our trails, just as we can see how trustworthy they are by following theirs. Both the providers and users of Uber or Airbnb know that their ratings will affect their ability to use the services in the future. Everyone’s past behavior is visible to all. Poor decisions can come back to haunt us. That goes for well-known services such as Airbnb as well as illicit services offered on the darknet. Drug dealers who trade anonymously using special software are more likely to be honest about their products than their equivalents on the street. The reason? They’re subject to a rating system that alerts potential customers to their track record. Rating increases trust to such an extent that even the most personal jobs can now be allocated to complete strangers – as long as their reputation is good enough! Take UrbanSitter. The app connects parents with potential babysitters. And the first time parents and sitter meet is when the latter arrives for work. How can parents whose primary concern is their child’s safety even think about leaving them alone with a complete stranger? Again – it’s all in the ratings. The app provides detailed information about all potential babysitters. Parents can check their reviews and watch their personal introduction videos. And they can also see whether they’ve babysat for friends and acquaintances. Rating systems allow us to trust complete strangers in the most intimate spheres of our lives. But it can also be taken too far, as we’ll learn in the next blink. Rating systems are currently restricted to specific platforms. But what if your whole life was subject to such a system? China is currently implementing a policy that will make that eerie possibility an unsettling reality for all its citizens by 2020. The Chinese Social Credit System (SCS) already exists, though it’s currently still optional. Its task is to rate all Chinese citizens and appraise their overall trustworthiness. So what constitutes “trustworthiness” in this system? The overall score is determined both by common indicators, such as credit ratings, as well as less standard criteria, including people’s behavior and preferences and interpersonal relationships. That means that Sesame Credit and China Rapid Finance, the two companies tasked with awarding everyone their score, have access to the social-media profiles of each citizen. So if a user posts a critical comment about Tiananmen Square, they can expect to see their overall score go down. But you don’t have to post anything critical to have your score lowered – it’s enough if you’re friends with someone who makes an anti-government remark online since that, in the logic of the system, indicates that you have poor interpersonal relationships! The lower your score, the more difficult your life will be. Citizens with low trustworthiness ratings will be subject to a multitude of inconveniences. They’ll be placed at the bottom of the list for travel visas and become less employable as well as being less likely to receive state benefits. They’ll also have their profile come up less frequently on dating sites. That creates an immense pressure to conform and maintain a high score. Whether government officials will be subject to the same pressures remains to be seen. We’ve all heard of blockchain technology, but what exactly is it? And what does it have to do with trust? Blockchain technology provides a record of every action undertaken by anything using the technology; it’s a kind of digital ledger in which the history of something is permanently stored. That could be anything from a diamond to a cryptocurrency. If we take the former as an example, we can see where trust comes in. Diamonds are notoriously difficult to trace and there’s every reason for unscrupulous traders who sell illegal blood diamonds mined in warzones to keep it that way. Blockchain technology allows every step in a diamond’s journey – from mine to shop counter – to be tracked and recorded. That’s a great way of building trust between sellers and buyers as well as clamping down on the trade in illegal diamonds. Will it work? Just ask the start-up Everledger, which is currently deploying blockchain technology to clean up the diamond market. Blockchain technology also has other uses. Think of fake news. If everything was recorded in a permanent online ledger, it would be easy to double-check claims and expose falsehoods before they spread through social media. But it’s not only products that will be revolutionized – it’s also the way we interact with the world. The old system of institutional trust relied on handsomely-rewarded experts like lawyers and estate agents who were paid to act as middlemen in transactions. Blockchain has the potential to make such intermediaries redundant. Public blockchains promise to make easily available all the data we need to make informed decisions. Say you want to buy a house. Everything you need to know about its past – what renovation work has been done on it or its previous valuations – will be at your fingertips. You would be the expert making your own decisions. Botsman believes that blockchains will revolutionize our trust relationships over the next decade, allowing us to take ever-greater trust leaps and making us wonder how we ever did anything without the technology. The key message in these blinks: The nature of trust is undergoing a dramatic shift in contemporary society. We are moving away from a top-down relationship with established institutions and toward a new, horizontal trust relationship with peers. Rating systems are at the heart of this trust revolution. When we know that we’re being rated by others, we become more trustworthy. That, in turn, allows us to trust strangers with even the most sensitive tasks, such as babysitting. Blockchain technology is set to take this revolution even further, allowing us to dispense with third parties and institutions entirely.  Actionable advice: Do your own research. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the big political and financial institutions of our day after all the recent revelations, but fake news is also more and more common. So who do you trust? The technologies driving the trust revolution make data available that allows us to make informed decisions on the basis of recorded facts. Even where that data doesn’t exist yet, we can approach the world with the same ethos. So next time you see a dubious headline, be proactive – look it up and trust your own judgment of the facts rather than being guided by hearsay. Got feedback?

With 2.2 billion users, and revenues that exceeded $40 billion in 2017, it is nothing short of a wild success. But more than being popular – and profitable – Facebook is influential. It has, in less than two decades, become a crucial part of the public sphere, the platform on which we not only communicate with our friends, but read the news, exchange opinions and debate the news of the day. But Facebook’s popularity and influence conceal a dark reality: it is lacking in clear moral or civic values to guide it. And in the absence of effective regulation, it is actively harming our society. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Facebook uses manipulative techniques to keep you hooked, and how one side effect is polarizing public debate. The blinks show how Facebook thrives on surveillance, gathering data on you to keep you hooked on the site and increasing your value to its advertisers. And you’ll come to understand just how easy it has been for external actors like Russia to use Facebook to influence users in the United States. In these blinks, you’ll learn how much data Facebook holds on you; how Facebook has persistently disregarded the privacy of its users; and why we should have nothing to fear about regulating Facebook and other tech giants. Back in the twentieth century, there weren’t many successful Silicon Valley start-ups run by people fresh out of college. Successful computer engineering relied on skill and experience and needed to overcome the constraints of limited computer processing power, storage and memory. The need for serious hardware infrastructure meant that not just anyone could build a start-up – and be an instant success. Technological developments in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries fundamentally changed this. When Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook in 2004, many of these barriers to new companies had simply disappeared. Engineers could create a workable product quickly, thanks to open-source software components like the browser Mozilla. And the emergence of cloud storage meant that start-ups could simply pay a monthly fee for their network infrastructures, rather than having to build something costly themselves. Suddenly, the lean start-up model emerged. Businesses like Facebook no longer needed to work slowly toward perfection before launching a product. They could quickly build something basic, push it out to users and update from there. Facebook’s famous “move fast and break things” philosophy was born. This also had a profound impact on the culture of companies like Facebook. No longer did an entrepreneur like Zuckerberg need a large and experienced pool of engineers with serious systems expertise to deliver a business plan. In fact, we know that Zuckerberg didn’t want people with experience. Inexperienced young men – and they were more often than not men – were not only cheaper, but could be molded in his image, making the company easier to manage. In the early years of Facebook, Zuckerberg himself was resolutely confident, not just in his business plan, but in the self-evidently beneficial goal of connecting the world. And as Facebook’s user numbers – and eventually, profitability – skyrocketed, why would anyone on his team question him? And even if they wanted to, Zuckerberg had set up Facebook’s shareholding rules so that he held a “golden vote,” meaning the company would always do what he decided. To grow as quickly as possible, Facebook did whatever it could to strip out sources of friction: the product would be free and the business would avoid regulation, thus also avoiding a need for transparency in its algorithms that might invite criticism. Unfortunately, while these were the right conditions for growth of a global superstar, they were also conditions that bred a disregard for user privacy, safety and civic responsibility. Now you know a little bit about Facebook. But how well does Facebook know you? Facebook holds up to 29,000 data points on each of its users. That’s 29,000 little things it knows about your life, from the fact that you like cat videos to whom you’ve been socializing with recently. So where does Facebook get that data? Take Connect, a service started in 2008, that allows users to sign into third-party websites through Facebook. Many users love the simplicity of not needing to remember countless complicated passwords for other sites. What most users don’t realize is that the service doesn’t just log them in. It also enables Facebook to surveil them on any site or application that used the log-in. Use Connect to log into news websites? Facebook knows exactly what you are reading. Or take photos. Lots of us love tagging our friends after a fun day or night out. You may think it’s an easy way to share with your friends, but for Facebook, you’re providing a valuable collection of information about your location, your activities and your social connections. Now, if a business is so greedy for your personal data, you’d at least hope that it would treat that data with care, right? Unfortunately, ever since the earliest days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg’s business has shown an apparent disregard for data privacy. In fact, according to Business Insider, after Zuckerberg gathered his first few thousand users, he messaged a friend to tell them that if they ever wanted information on anyone at their university, they should just ask. He now had thousands of emails, photos and addresses. People had simply submitted them, the young entrepreneur said. They were, in his reported words, “dumb fucks.” A cavalier attitude toward data privacy at Facebook has persisted ever since. For example, in 2018, journalists revealed that Facebook had sent marketing materials to phone numbers provided by users for two-factor authentication, a security feature, despite having promised not to do so. And in the same year, it was revealed that Facebook had simply downloaded the phone records – including calls and texts – of those of its users who used Android phones. Again, the users in question had no idea this was happening. Facebook wants your data for a reason: to make more money by keeping you on the platform for longer and thus making its offer to advertisers more valuable. Let’s take a look at this in more detail. For social media platforms, time is money. Specifically, your time is their money. Because the longer you spend on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, and the more attention you give them, the more advertising they can sell. As a result, capturing and keeping your attention is at the heart of Facebook’s commercial success. The business has gotten better than anyone else at getting inside your brain. Some of the techniques it uses are about how it displays information. These include the automatic playing of videos, and a never-ending feed of information. These keep you hooked by eliminating the normal cues to disengage. You can reach the end of a newspaper, but never the end of Facebook’s news feed. Other techniques go a little deeper into human psychology by, for example, exploiting FOMO – the fear of missing out. Try to deactivate a Facebook account, and you’ll be presented not just with a standard confirmation screen, but with the faces of your best friends, Tom and Jane, and the words “Tom and Jane will miss you.” But the most sophisticated and sinister techniques used by Facebook lie in the decision-making process of its artificial intelligence, which decides what to show you. When you scroll through Facebook, you might think you are looking at a simple news feed. But you aren’t. You are up against a mammoth artificial intelligence that has huge quantities of data about you, and is feeding you what it thinks will keep you engaged with the site for as long as possible. And the bad news for society is that that often means content that appeals to your most basic emotions. That’s because triggering our basic emotions is what keeps you engaged. Joy works, which is why cute cat videos are so common. But what works best? Emotions like fear and anger. As a result, Facebook tends to nudge us toward content that will get us riled up because riled-up users consume more content and share it more often. So you are less likely to see calm headlines describing events and more likely to see sensational claims in short punchy videos. And that can become dangerous. Particularly when we get stuck in a bubble where our outrage, fears or other emotions are constantly reinforced by people with similar views. That’s the danger of the so-called filter-bubble, which we’ll look at in the next blink. Every second you browse Facebook, you are feeding data into its filtering algorithm. And the result is a filter bubble, as Facebook filters out content that it thinks you won’t like, and filters in content that you are more likely to read, like and share. Eli Pariser, president of the campaigning organization MoveOn, was one of the first to publicize the effect of filter bubbles, in a 2011 Ted Talk. Pariser noticed that, although his Facebook friends list was pretty evenly balanced between conservatives and liberals, there was nothing neutral about his newsfeed. His tendency to like, share or click on liberal content was leading Facebook to give him more of what it thought he wanted, until he never saw any conservative content at all. As Pariser argued, this is problematic. Many people get their news and information from Facebook, and think they are receiving a balance of content. But in reality, algorithms with huge power but no civic responsibilities are feeding them a biased view of the world. Even worse problems arise when filter-bubble effects shift users from mainstream to more extreme views. This can happen as a result of algorithms shifting users toward more emotive, outrageous content. For example, a former YouTube employee, Guillaume Chaslot, wrote software that showed how YouTube’s algorithmic recommendations worked. It showed that, if a user watches any video on the platform about 9/11, that user will then receive recommendations for 9/11 conspiracy videos. But even without algorithms, people are often radicalized by social media. And that’s particularly the case when they are members of Facebook groups. There are countless groups on Facebook, and whatever your political preferences, there’s one for you. And they are great for Facebook’s business, as they enable easy targeting for advertisers. But they can be problematic. Cass Sunstein, the behavioral economist and coauthor of Nudge (2008), has shown that when people with similar views discuss issues, their opinions tend to become stronger and more extreme with time. There’s another problem with groups: they are vulnerable to manipulation. The organization Data for Democracy has shown that just one or two percent of a group’s members can steer its conversation, if they know what they’re doing. And this is exactly what the Russians did ahead of the 2016 US elections. Do you really know where the content you read on Facebook comes from? If you were in the United States in 2016, it’s very likely that you read, and maybe even shared, Facebook content that originated with Russian trolls. Despite mounting evidence, Facebook denied that Russia had used the platform until, in September 2017, it admitted that it had discovered advertising spending of around $100,000 by Russian-hosted fake accounts. Facebook would later reveal that Russian interference had reached 126 million users on the platform, and another 20 million on Instagram. Given that 137 million people voted in the election, it’s hard not to believe that Russian interference had some impact. Russia’s tactics in the 2016 election were to rile up Trump supporters, while depressing turnout among potential democrat voters. And the truth is, it was easy, thanks to Facebook groups, which offered Russia an easy way to target key demographics. For example, Russian operatives ran a number of groups focused on people of color, such as the group Blacktivist, apparently with the purpose of spreading disinformation that would reduce the likelihood of users voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Moreover, groups made it easy for content to get shared. We tend to trust our fellow group members – they share our interests and beliefs, after all. So we are often uncritical of where information is coming from, if it’s shared within a group with which we identify. The author himself noticed that friends of his were sharing deeply misogynistic images of Hillary Clinton that had originated in Facebook groups supporting Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s opponent in the Democratic primaries. It was almost impossible to believe that Sanders’ campaign was behind them, but they were spreading virally. And Russia’s ability to influence through groups was vividly shown with the notorious example of the 2016 Houston mosque protests, when Facebook events controlled by Russians organized simultaneous protests both for and against Islam outside a mosque in Houston, Texas. The manipulation was part of Russia’s overall efforts to sow discord and confrontation in the United States based on anti-minority and anti-immigrant sentiment, as Russia knew that this would play into the hands of the Trump campaign. Four million people voted for Obama in 2012, but not for Clinton in 2016. How many of these four million didn’t vote Democrat because of Russian disinformation and lies about the Clinton campaign? In 2011, Facebook entered into an agreement with the American consumer protection body and regulator, the Federal Trade Commission, that barred Facebook from deceptive data privacy practices. Under the decree, Facebook needed to get explicit, informed consent from users before it could share their data. But the sad reality is that Facebook did nothing of the kind. In March 2018, a story broke that tied Facebook’s political impact to its disregard for user privacy. Cambridge Analytica, a company providing data analytics to Donald Trump’s election campaign, had harvested and misappropriated almost fifty million Facebook user profiles. Cambridge Analytica funded a researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, to build a data set of American voters. He created a personality test on Facebook, which 270,000 people took in return for a couple of dollars. The test collected information on their personality traits. Crucially, it also captured data about the test-takers’ Facebook friends – all 49 million of them collectively – without these friends knowing anything about it, let alone giving consent. Suddenly, the data team for a controversial presidential candidate had a trove of highly detailed personal data for about 49 million people. And while Cambridge Analytica wasn’t allowed, under Facebook’s terms of service, to use the data commercially, it did so anyway. This was particularly controversial because, according to a whistleblower, Cambridge Analytica was able to match Facebook profiles with 30 million actual voter files. This gave the Trump campaign enormously valuable data on thirteen percent of the nation’s voters, allowing it to target propaganda at these voters with incredible precision. Remember that just three swing states, won by Trump with a combined margin of just 77,744 votes, gave him a victory in the Electoral College. It seems almost impossible that Cambridge Analytica’s targeting, based on Facebook’s data breach, didn’t influence this outcome. As the story broke, Facebook tried to argue that it had been a victim of Cambridge Analytica’s malpractice. But Facebook’s actions suggest otherwise. When Facebook found out about the data breach, it wrote to Cambridge Analytica, asking for copies of the dataset to be destroyed. But no audit or inspection was ever carried out. Instead, Cambridge Analytica was just asked to tick a box on a form to confirm compliance. Moreover, Facebook had itself happily embedded three team members in the Trump campaign’s digital operations at the same time when Cambridge Analytica was working for Facebook. The Cambridge Analytica story was a turning point. Many came to believe that, in the pursuit of growth and profit, Facebook had ignored its moral and societal obligations. If this is true, this question remains: What can society do about it? As the Russian interference and Cambridge Analytica scandals have shown, Facebook has not taken the need to regulate its own behavior seriously enough. Perhaps, then, the time has come to think about external regulation. One aspect of this should be economic regulation designed to weaken the overall market power held by Facebook and other tech giants, just like the kind of regulation applied in the past to giants like Microsoft and IBM. One reason Facebook is so powerful is because it has used its financial weight simply to buy up competitors, like Instagram and WhatsApp. This needn’t influence economic growth or overall innovation negatively, as the historical example of phone operator AT&T shows. In 1956, AT&T reached a settlement with the government to control the company’s spiraling power. It would limit itself to the landline telephone business and would license its patents at no cost so others could use them. This turned out to be seriously good news for the US economy because, by making the AT&T’s crucial invention and patent – the transistor – freely available, this antitrust ruling essentially gave birth to Silicon Valley. Computers, video games, smartphones and the internet – all of it came from the transistor. And crucially, the case also worked out for AT&T. Confined to a core business, it nonetheless became so successful that it was subject to another monopoly case in 1984. Applying the same kind of logic to the likes of Facebook and Google would still allow them to thrive but limit their market power and encourage more competition. Economic regulation is one thing. But if we are truly to tackle the damaging impact of Facebook on society, we also need regulation that gets to the heart of its harmfulness. One place to start would be to mandate the option of an unfiltered Facebook newsfeed view. With a click of a button, you could toggle your news feed from “your view” – based on Facebook’s artificial intelligence judgments of what will keep you interested the longest – to a more neutral or balanced view of what’s happening in the world. Another positive step would be to regulate algorithms and artificial intelligence. In the US, this could be done via an equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration for technology, with responsibility for ensuring that algorithms serve, rather than exploit, humans. Mandated third-party auditing of algorithms would create sufficient transparency to avoid the worst cases of filter-bubbles and manipulation. We accept and value regulation in many industries, using it to strike the right balance between public interest and economic freedom. At present, when it comes to tech, that balance is not being properly struck. It’s time for change. The key message in these blinks: Facebook has become a catastrophe: keeping people hooked to their screens, pushing us toward more extreme views, riding roughshod over personal privacy and influencing elections. It’s time to fight back, and stop treating Facebook’s negative impacts on individuals and society as acceptable.  Actionable advice: Change the physical appearance of your devices to reduce their impact on your health.  Two changes to the appearance of your digital devices can make a big difference. First, changing your device to night-shift mode will reduce the blues in the display, which lowers eye strain and makes it easier to get to sleep. Secondly, putting a smartphone in monochrome mode reduces its visual intensity, and therefore the dopamine hit you get from looking at it. Got feedback?

Or how many times has something as simple as “waking up on the wrong side of the bed” completely ruined what could have been an otherwise pleasant day? These blinks will show you how you can manage your emotions through meditation. In them, the author shares his own compelling personal anecdotes so you can better understand that the ancient art of meditation is far more than a new-age fad – it can truly change your life. In fact, recent scientific studies have shown that mindfulness and meditation can have profound effects on your mental and physical health, and thus your well-being. Meditating can even make you more productive – regardless of how you live your life – by helping you conquer your ego and manage your emotions. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: why being selfish isn’t such a bad thing; why you sometimes find yourself gazing into the fridge without being hungry; and how meditation might save you from suffering a heart attack. We hear the word “ego” quite often. Your spouse might call you egotistical; your best friend is egocentric; and armchair philosophers invoke Freudian buzzwords, blaming personal shortcomings on the ego. But the ego is far more nuanced than we give it credit. In our everyday interactions, we often refer to the ego as the source of pride, conceit and amour propre, or self-love. To most, the ego is the source of behavior that is self-serving or unconcerned with the well-being of others. To Freud, the ego represents a psychological mechanism that mediates between our morality and our base desires. But these definitions of ego still don’t get to the heart of the matter. We can talk about deep desire or fiery pride, but we still can’t explain what’s going on in our heads when we do strange things like open the fridge without actually being hungry. A better way to think of your ego – and certainly one that offers you the most insight into your behavior – is as the voice in your head. Your ego comments on your actions and behavior from the moment you open your eyes in the morning until you drift off to sleep at night, telling you what to do and what not to do. This isn’t the kind of “voice in your head” that is attributed to psychosis. Rather, you can think of it as a voice that manifests through your thoughts. For example, your ego is the voice that tells you “I’m way too tired for the gym” even when you know that you could really stand to break a sweat. It’s what makes you obsessively check your emails a thousand times per day, or gaze into the refrigerator even when you aren’t hungry. As you’ll see, the ego is responsible for a great deal of what you do. Luckily, taking steps to rein your ego in can make us happier and healthier. The ego is never satisfied. It will always want, it will never be content and it will never be perfectly  happy. By design, the ego will always want more than it already has. When the ego is “fed” a new thing, this simply resets the baseline for desire; and immediately, the ego begins reaching for something more. It doesn’t matter how many material possessions you have, nor does it matter how much money you’ve spent acquiring them – even if you don’t need it, you still yearn for the newest sports car or that hot new gadget. The best meals are not satisfying, even when prepared by the best chefs. Soon you’ll become hungry and yearn for a meal that is even tastier than the last. In essence, no matter how many times you try to satiate your ego’s desires, your ego will only want more. The ego is obsessed with the past and the future, and in its obsession, neglects the present, thus keeping you from fully living in the now. The ego loves especially to dwell in the past and thrives on drama by keeping old wounds open. It’s the reason that you complain to your spouse about a work problem at dinner, and it’s what causes you to lament being jilted by your first love at 17, despite being happily married today. Your ego constantly assesses your worth against the appearance, wealth and social status of others, but will always find you failing. No matter how smart, beautiful or wealthy you may be, according to your ego, there’s always someone smarter, more beautiful or wealthier. Thus, your ego will spur you to continually strive to become that “better” person. But after achieving what your ego wants, will you be happy? No. The ego is never happy. Just think of all the rich, famous or fortunate people who have committed suicide, become addicted to drugs or otherwise ruined their lives. The next blinks will show you how you can use meditation to calm your ego and improve your life. When we practice meditation, we learn a valuable skill called mindfulness. Mindfulness is the ability to respond – and not react – to our surroundings as well as our impulses. Meditation increases our mindfulness by instructing us to immerse ourselves fully in the present moment, and not to be overwhelmed with life’s stressors. For instance, when a colleague told the author that he would never become a big-time anchorman, he used his newfound mindfulness to respond rather than react. He didn’t let his ego and anger control him, but instead calmly asked his boss how he could improve his work. Mindfulness doesn’t just improve our decision making; it also changes our biology. A Harvard MRI study observed that people who had taken an eight-week mindfulness course through meditation had developed thicker gray matter in the areas of the brain associated with self-awareness and compassion. Likewise, mindfulness training appeared to shrink the regions in the brain associated with stress. This increase in compassionate behavior, that is, practicing concern for your own well-being and the well-being of others, is not something to be overlooked. Demonstrating compassion toward yourself improves your decision making by allowing you to forgive yourself for mistakes and accept your flaws. In fact, studies have demonstrated that people trained in self-compassion meditation are more likely to demonstrate healthy behavior, such as quitting smoking or eating healthier. Likewise, being compassionate toward others actually helps you to become a more fulfilled person. One study asked participants for a few days to wear tape recorders which would record their conversations. The recordings verified that participants who practiced meditation were more empathic, spent more time with other people, laughed more and used the word “I” less. Indeed, we can use compassion for others to our own advantage. As the Dalai Lama put it: “Be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish.” Some people dread the Buddhist concept of “letting go,” as they see it as going soft or becoming ineffective – an act of capitulation. For example, the American author and psychotherapist Marc Epstein often recounts the story of his Buddhist patients who denied themselves orgasms during sex or refused to place an order themselves at restaurants as a means of not expressing personal preference. Obviously, this sort of behavior did not make them happier people! Controlling your ego does not mean forgetting about your own needs and becoming a pushover. An Indian meditation teacher named Munindra advised all of his students to keep things “simple and easy.” One day, a student saw his teacher fiercely negotiating over a bag of peanuts in the village marketplace. When the student confronted him over his behavior, what he thought was a contradiction to the simple-and-easy-mantra, Munindra replied: “I said be simple, not a simpleton!” Controlling your ego does not mean that you have to lose your edge or stop being a productive member of society. In fact, according to professor Jon Kabat-Zinn, practicing mindfulness actually makes you more creative and more productive, as it clears your mind of unhelpful assumptions and routines, thus making space for new ideas and thoughts. During a ten-day meditation retreat, the author was flooded with ideas with which he filled entire notebooks. He was more productive in this time of peace and mindfulness than normally, when his mind is cluttered and chaotic.   Interestingly, one of the most important discoveries that the author made on his journey to tame his ego was that high levels of stress or the need for competition weren’t necessary to fuel his drive. Quite the contrary: he found that it was a much more satisfying exercise to control these urges than to indulge in them. At this point, we’ve talked quite a lot about meditation. But what is it exactly? In essence, when you meditate, you sit comfortably and focus on your own breath. During this time, your mind will inevitably wander off to other things. That’s okay! When this happens, simply refocus your mind on your breathing without judgment. The nice thing about meditation is that you don’t need anything to get started – anyone can meditate anywhere. So, meditation is easy. But what’s in it for you? Why should you bother? For starters, meditation increases mindfulness by teaching us to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental distance. According to Buddhist teachings, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience: We want it. Think about that gut-level desire to eat a delicious cookie. We reject it. Imagine swatting at annoying mosquitos. We zone out. Have you ever listened to a flight attendant’s safety instructions all the way through? Yeah, right. Mindfulness gives us a fourth option: we observe without judgment. Your first experience with mindfulness during meditation often happens when you experience some sort of uncomfortable situation, like an itchy nose or sore legs. In these cases, you simply observe the pain with impartiality and without reacting or moving. Eventually, you’ll be able to apply mindfulness to more complex discomforts: your thoughts and emotions. In addition, meditation increases your compassion. In the month after the author added conscious compassion to his meditation practice, he began seeing changes in his life: he found that he was not only kinder to others, but also to himself. For example, he was better able to avoid gossip at work, became more empathetic toward others and felt less annoyed by their idiosyncrasies or shortcomings. Meditation is not only good for the mind; it also can have profound positive effects on the body. Humans still haven’t shed the “fight or flight” instinct, triggered in times of danger. While modern life has changed our daily threats, however, from prowling tigers to highway traffic, how stress affects our body hasn’t changed. Constant stimulation keeps us in a state of overload, which causes high levels of toxic stress chemicals to accumulate in our blood. However, studies have shown that meditation can actually reverse the effects of these stress chemicals, by lowering blood pressure and thus reducing the risk of heart disease.   Research also suggests that the mindfulness practiced during meditation can spill into everyday life, leading to increased patience, empathy and compassion. Imagine that you are stuck in a traffic jam on your way to work. Normally, you might react angrily and impatiently, punching your steering wheel and thinking: “Why is this happening to me?!” However, once you have practiced mindfulness, you will simply observe these thoughts and let them pass without becoming consumed by them. You will not react, but respond with sober calmness. Other studies have shown even more obvious health benefits. Meditation can also be beneficial in battling major depression, drug addiction, binge eating and smoking. It can help cancer patients better handle stress and senior citizens avoid loneliness. Meditation can also stem the effects of ADHD, asthma, psoriasis and even irritable bowel syndrome. Finally, meditation allows you to sculpt the one tool you have for perceiving and experiencing the world: your brain. Indeed, studies have shown that training your brain through meditation can improve your resilience, impulse control and your overall level of well-being. Yet meditation cannot rid your mind of negative thoughts altogether. But as the final blink will show, it can still help you deal with those thoughts. Meditation, however, is not a cure-all. So what should you do to help stem the influence of negative emotions? Psychotherapist and Buddhist teacher Tara Brach suggests that you simply acknowledge your negative feelings – that is, admit that you’re experiencing them, rather than deny them. The Buddhists teach that we should “let go,” but what they really mean, is “let it be.” Instead of denying “ugly” characteristics or negative feelings, just let them be without judging yourself for having them. Another Buddhist saying is that “the only way out is through.” Imagine those negative feelings as a immense wave coming right toward you. The best way not to drown is to dive into the wave, thus causing it to lose its power. The author learned this the hard way after he tried to shut out all his memories of reporting in a war zone through using drugs, instead of acknowledging the sorrow and brutality he had witnessed. Eventually, his refusal to manage his negative emotions in a healthy way led to him having a panic attack on air! There are more proactive ways of dealing with negative emotions. According to Brach’s teachings, there are four stages to accepting these feelings. First, you must recognize the emotion, then allow it to exist, investigate its effects and finally separate yourself from it through the practice of non-identification. The author practiced this when he was concerned about a promotion. First, he recognized that he was worried. Next, he convinced himself that it was okay to be worried. Then he investigated how his body was handling the worry; he felt a buzzing in his chest. And finally, he practiced non-identification, telling himself that he is bigger than his momentary concerns and that the moment would pass. By recognizing that his fears over a promotion would not turn him into a habitually worried person, the author was able to separate himself from his emotions and conquer his ego. The key message in this book: Our modern lives push us into a constant state of stress and panic, and this has major consequences on our mental and physical health. We can combat this stress through the practice of meditation, which can ultimately lead to a more compassionate, fulfilling and productive lifestyle. Actionable advice: Increase your compassion through “metta meditation.” Picture yourself clearly in your mind and repeat the following phrases: May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be safe, may you live with ease. Then repeat the same sentences or mantra, this time imagining a benefactor, a dear friend, a neutral person, a person with whom you have difficulties and finally, all living beings. What to read next: The Happiness Project, by Gretchen Rubin Now that you’ve learned how meditation can improve your physical and mental well-being in an increasingly hectic world, it’s time to ask yourself a daunting question: Am I happy? When author Gretchen Rubin asked herself this question she found that, although she had a good job, a loving family and some savings in the bank, she often felt far from happy. So she decided to go on a yearlong journey to figure out what happiness really is and how to get more of it in her life. The Happiness Project is the result of that journey.

While driving home, you think to yourself, “I really worked hard today, so I deserve a little treat.” You stop at a donut shop on the way and before you know it, you’ve already gobbled up a dozen delicious donuts. This may seem innocuous enough, but many of us are guilty of the same kind of behavior: we work hard to achieve lasting change in our life, but don’t pay attention to the bad behaviors that are undermining our efforts. These blinks present 13 habits you should learn to avoid if you want to develop greater mental strength and achieve more success and happiness in life. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Oprah Winfrey reached the top; what to do when you feel envious of others’ success; and why you should stay clear of the entitlement disease. No one is immune to hard times. Whether it comes in the form of illness or some other personal tragedy, sooner or later, life’s going to throw you some curveballs. How you react to these situations says a lot about you. One of the hallmarks of mentally strong people – those who aren’t knocked down when things get tough – is that they don’t spend precious time pitying themselves when facing difficulties. So what do they do instead? They replace self-pity with gratitude – and you can too. If you want an inspiring example of mental strength and the importance of gratitude, take American long-distance runner Marla Runyan. Not only has she run the New York Marathon in a little over two hours, she also has a master’s degree in education and has written a book. But perhaps most impressively, she’s accomplished all of this while being legally blind. At the age of nine, Runyan was diagnosed with Stargardt’s disease, a degenerative disease that affects the eyes. Despite her quickly worsening eyesight, Runyan developed a passion for running and went on to win several medals, setting world records at the 1992 and 1996 Paralympics. The key to her success lies in her refusal to indulge in self-pity. She’s always refused to see her illness as a disability; instead, she sees it as an opportunity, a gift that has enabled her to become a world-class athlete. Rather than dwelling on what her illness took away from her, she’s actually grateful for what it gave her. And there’s good reason to take a page out of Runyan’s book. Research shows that developing your capacity for gratitude can make you stronger on many levels. To begin with, increased gratitude can improve your physical health. A 2003 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, for example, found that people who are grateful have healthier immune systems and suffer less often from aches and pains. What’s more, they also exercise more frequently, sleep better and enjoy a better general standard of health than their less grateful peers. So gratitude is clearly very important. Now let’s turn to another feature of the mentally strong. In 1956, Andy Warhol offered one of his paintings to the New York Museum of Modern Art. The museum refused, seeing no potential in the young painter’s work. Fast forward a few decades and Warhol had become so successful that he had his own museum. Shortly before recording an album that would go on sell over 10 million copies, Madonna received a rejection letter from a major record label. Dismissively, the note suggested that “the only thing missing from this project is the material.” Most successful people have faced similar moments of rejection in their lives, moments where the negative opinions of others could have nipped their careers in the bud. What distinguishes mentally strong people, like Madonna and Warhol, is that they don’t let the opinions of others determine how they think and act in life. In other words, they refuse to delegate the power over their lives to others. Oprah Winfrey is another great example of someone with this aspect of mental strength. She was raised in poverty and experienced repeated instances of sexual abuse. At the age of 14, she became pregnant, only for the child to die shortly after birth. Throughout this difficult period, she was frequently mocked and taunted by others for being poor. But Oprah didn’t waste her time worrying about what others were saying about her; instead, she worked and studied hard and got a job as a TV news anchor. However, she was subsequently fired because she wasn’t considered “suitable” to be on air. Again, she didn’t let the opinions of others take away her power. She worked harder than ever and, eventually, developed what would become her mega-successful talk show.   Not so bad for someone who had once been teased for being so poor she had to wear potato sacks for clothes. As Oprah’s experience shows, holding on to your power is crucial to success. But how do you do it? It might seem counterintuitive, but forgiving others for their transgressions against you is an important part of reclaiming your power. If you hold a grudge, emotions of anger and resentment will not have an impact on the person you are angry with; they will, however, limit your own ability. In fact, all you’re doing is giving more power to that person to disrupt your life.   Forgiving others enables you to reclaim your power by placing your focus back on you. And the psychological and physical benefits are notable, with many studies confirming that forgiveness reduces stress. For example, when people engage in forgiveness, their blood pressure decreases and their hearts beat more calmly.   A 2012 study, published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine, also showed that forgiveness is a predictor of longevity – but only if it’s unconditional forgiveness. People who were only prepared to forgive others if they fulfilled certain conditions – for example, if they had apologized for what they did – had lower life expectancy than a control group. Unconditional forgiveness, on the other hand, ensured a longer life span. So don’t give up your power and learn to forgive! Judge Greg Mathis is a great example of a mentally strong person. Arrested several times as a teenager, he promised his dying mother that he would change. After being released from jail on probation, he started working at McDonald’s and eventually got accepted to Eastern Michigan University, and later, law school. However, because of his record as a criminal, he was barred from working as a lawyer. It would have been easy to let this obstacle from the past stand in his way. But Mathis was always ready for change, even when it seemed improbable; he quickly found other ways to serve the city of Detroit. After a period as the manager for Detroit Neighborhood City Halls, he and his wife founded a nonprofit organization that helped young people find work. A few years later, despite his opponents never missing a chance to bring up his criminal past, he was elected a judge by the people of Detroit. Mathis’s success is testament to another characteristic of mentally strong people: embracing change in your life. So how can you adopt the right attitude toward change? The first step is to ask yourself which change you’d like to make in your life, thinking very carefully about how this change would make you feel. Pay special attention to negative feelings and thoughts, like “I’ll never be able to do this” or “There’s no use in trying because I’ve always failed in the past.” Once you have these pesky thoughts and feelings at the center of your mind, you can decide whether you should listen to them or not. It’s highly likely that you’ll discover that such thoughts are unfounded and not worth listening to. Once you’ve learned to ignore these types of thoughts, you can create a plan for successful change. It consists of five steps: Set yourself a 30-day goal. Let’s say you’re trying to learn French. A good 30-day goal could be to learn the 300 most common words in the language. Decide on concrete, daily changes in your behavior that will help you reach that goal. To reach your 30-day goal of learning 300 French words, you could decide on a time each day where you learn ten new words. Create a list of anticipated hurdles along the way. For instance, you might anticipate that there will be days when drilling words will feel like a boring, repetitive chore. When this happens, you could decide to picture yourself mentally in France, comfortably chatting away with someone in French. That will give you renewed motivation. Create accountability. Ask a friend if he or she would be willing to test you on all the 300 words once the 30 days are up. That way, you’ll be more likely to reach your goal. Measure progress. Make sure to keep a journal of how many words you’ve learned. Seeing it fill up with all your daily achievements will motivate you to keep going.     By being more mindful about your feelings around change and by using the five steps for preparing for change, you’ll be on your way toward your goals. If you’ve ever been caught in bad traffic on your way to an important appointment, you probably know how frustrating it can be. You hiss and froth, cursing the cars in front of you. Although it can feel good to hurl invectives at the world, you should remember that it’s a total waste, not just of time but of precious energy. You’ll never catch a mentally strong person doing this – they never waste energy fretting over things they can’t control. Take Terry Fox, who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a severe type of bone cancer, when he was just 18. As a result of the disease, one of his legs had to be amputated and doctors told him he had only a 15-percent chance of surviving the illness. The day before his surgery, Fox read about a person with a prosthetic leg who ran the New York marathon and was immediately inspired. Following his operation, he began running and soon completed his first marathon. But this was just the beginning. Fox decided to raise money for cancer research by finding sponsors for a race across all of Canada. To complete this epic trek, he planned to run the equivalent of one marathon every day. Half-way through his journey across Canada, Fox broke down and had to be hospitalized; his cancer had returned. Though he couldn’t complete his trek, the sponsorship money kept pouring in, as people were inspired by his courage and ambition. He died months later, but only after raising $23 million for cancer research. What can we learn from Fox’s story? Don’t waste effort on what you can’t control; concentrate on doing what you can. Fox couldn’t control his health, so he didn’t focus on that. Instead, he concentrated on where he could make a difference: raising millions for charity. Research shows that this attitude toward things that aren’t under your control can work wonders for your well-being. A 2012 study by K. April showed that being less controlling increases happiness and leads to better relationships. In fact, the greatest levels of happiness are achieved by people who take a lot of steps to steer their life in the direction they want, while at the same time accepting that there are many things that are out of their control. You’ve probably noticed that some people are mortally afraid of showing their true emotions, like anger or sadness, for fear of hurting other people’s feelings. Perhaps someone close to you is like that. Although being sensitive to other people’s feelings may seem like an unquestionable virtue, it often backfires. If you want to develop your own mental strength, you should learn not to fear hurting other people’s feelings. For example, one of the author’s acquaintances, Angela, always strived to please the men she dated. If the men told her they liked humor in a woman, she would try to crack a few jokes. If they said they liked spontaneity, she would tell them about her travels to France, embellishing details to make them seem spontaneous even though they were carefully planned. She was trying to make herself more attractive, but her efforts had the opposite effect. After all, no one wants to date a fake and shallow person who allows themselves to become a screen onto which you can project different fantasies. Angela always agreed with everything her dates said because she thought that if she presented her own opinion, it would hurt their feelings and make them run away. In the end, she cared more about their feelings than her own. This is no way to lead your life; in fact, being prepared to displease other people actually makes you stronger. Take the example of Mose Gingerich. Raised in an Amish village, as a young adult Mose began to doubt whether he shared Amish values and belief systems. Leaving the community, however, would be a tough choice, as this would sever all contact to the community, including to his mother and sister, forever. He experimented with temporarily leaving the community and travelling to other Amish cultures to see the world in between. In the end, he was strong enough to walk away from everything that was known to him. He moved to Missouri, founded a construction company and married happily. This newfound security also allowed him to accept the disapproval of his entire childhood community. In short, listening to yourself, and not to the concerns of others, will make your confidence and happiness soar. If there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that you’ll never get very far if you don’t take any risks in life. However, taking big risks can lead to demotivating failures. Quitting your day job to turn your hobby into a business, even though you have no prior business experience, might seem like a great idea – but it most likely involves greater risks than you think. If you fail, you’ll not only be left without a job and income, you might never want to take any risks again. That’s why mentally strong people always seek to minimize the risks they take, and when they need to take a risk, they are clever about which ones they take. Mitigating risk starts by carefully analyzing the nature of the risk itself. Once the elements of risk are clear, you can take the right steps to minimize them.   When the author, for example, was asked to deliver a valedictorian address at her school’s graduation ceremony, she was more terrified than excited about the opportunity. So, she tried to figure out what exactly it was that scared her so much and determine what the risk actually was. She discovered that what really worried her was that the audience would reject her. So, she made a plan with her best friends to circumvent this fear: they decided that, once she was done with her speech, her friends would give her a standing ovation. She gave the speech with a great deal of nervous fumbling – but as soon as she was done, her friends got on their feet and started cheering as if she was their greatest idol. And, remarkably, the other people followed suit. By preparing just a bit, she was able to take the risk of public speaking without really risking the humiliation she dreaded. Or take the example of the famous psychologist Albert Ellis. As a young man, Ellis was terrified of talking to women because of the corresponding risk of rejection. However, after giving it some rational thought, he concluded that possible rejection was not as bad as he imagined. So he gave talking to women a try. He went to the local botanical garden every day and sat down next to women sitting alone. After engaging them in conversation, he would ask them if they’d like to go for a drink. In total, he talked to 130 women, 30 of whom left as soon as he sat down. Of the remaining 100 that he invited on a date, only one accepted – and even then she didn’t show up for the date. But for Ellis this didn’t matter. The important thing was the realization that his irrational fear of rejection was unjustified. He had unnecessarily let it hinder him from talking to members of the opposite sex for too long. So, if you want to develop your mental strength, start looking at the risks that hold you back. Maybe they aren’t as dangerous and scary as you've always imagined. Many people feel like they are haunted by their past and by the legacy of their parents and families. But it’s possible to find constructive ways to move forward despite one’s origins.    Take activist and social worker Wynona Ward. Born in a small village in Vermont, she grew up with a  sexually and physically abusive father. Ward didn’t tell anyone about this abuse, but worked hard to get ahead in school and escape her hometown. She got married as a 17-year-old and began working as a truck driver with her husband. But while she’d worked hard to free herself, others in her family struggled to do so. For example, Ward discovered that one of her brothers was now abusing his own children. She decided that something had to change. She went back to university in Vermont and studied in every moment of her free time. After a lot of hard work, Ward managed to get a degree in law. With some financial aid, she founded Have Justice Will Travel, a traveling legal service for families in the countryside who were dealing with domestic abuse problems. Ward’s actions show us an important mind-set of mentally strong people. Coming to terms with the past doesn’t mean acting as if certain things never happened; you must accept and forgive the past so that you can build on it in the present. For instance, Wynona Ward didn’t run from her past, or wipe it from her memory. Instead, she used her experience as the basis for making the world a better place. Coming to grips with your past can be tough, though, and moving forward doesn’t just happen. To be successful, you need to start by taking concrete steps. First of all, you have to give yourself permission to enjoy your life, despite what might have happened in the past. Then, you have to be wary of attitudes that keep you from experiencing change. For example, if you notice you are avoiding meeting up with new people because your last crush hurt you, think about changing that attitude. Your heartbreak in the past is no reason not to keep looking for true love. If you learn to apply the lessons you’ve learned in these blinks so far, you’ll be on your way to greater mental strength. But even if you succeed in making some changes, it’s easy to fall back into old habits. This is another characteristic of mentally strong people; they study and learn from their mistakes so they don’t repeat them in the future. When Rowland Macy, for example, launched a dry goods store in a small-town in Massachusetts in the mid-nineteenth century, he made the mistake of choosing a quiet location in the town, and struggled to attract customers a result. To drum up interest in his fledgling store, Macy organized a large parade through his town. Unfortunately, on the day of the parade, it rained so hard that nobody turned up. As a result, he had to give up his business. But Macy learned from this experience and vowed not to make the same mistake again. The next time he opened a “Macy Dry Goods” store he chose a prime location in downtown New York. It was a massive hit. Macy’s became one of the biggest chain stores in the world and still holds a parade every year – just in the fall, when the risk of sudden storms is smaller.   But how can you use this strength in your own life? To learn from your mistakes the next time something goes wrong, the author suggests you take some time to ask yourself the following questions: What did I do wrong? What could I have done better? And what can I do differently next time around? Try to set negative feelings and self-doubt aside and simply answer the questions honestly. By doing this consistently, you’ll have a clear idea of how to act next time. Of course, knowing what you need to do differently and actually doing it aren't the same thing. This is why, if you want to put a stop to the bad habits once and for all, you need to practice self-discipline. Here’s a few simple methods to become a more disciplined person. Do you feel bad when someone you know becomes successful? If so, you’re not alone. This kind of envy is common. A 2013 study by psychologist Mina Cikara found that people not only resent other people’s success, they also take particular pleasure if a person suffering bad luck is a particularly successful person. Participants in the study were shown photographs of four different types of people – a student, an elderly person, a drug addict and a wealthy professional – in various situations. Incredibly, they experienced greater pleasure from scenarios where the wealthy professional suffered in some way, like getting soaked by the water from a passing car driving through a puddle, than when any of the four types of people received some good fortune. Resentment and envy of success are common human traits, but this doesn't make them healthy. If you want to be more successful, you must learn to overcome your initial envy of other people’s success and harness their power instead. The best way to do this is through collaboration. Take the example of chocolatier Milton Hershey. One of his employees, H. B. Reese, started building up a rival candy company in the same city while he was still working in Hershey’s chocolate factory. Instead of becoming angry or resentful, Hershey surprisingly gave Reese his full support. Reese created his own special candy, the peanut butter cup, and Hershey’s factory provided the milk chocolate for his experiments. The two men continued to collaborate throughout their lives, and after their deaths, the two companies merged. If both men had viewed each other’s success with envy, they'd have needlessly fought against each other. Yet, by supporting each other's strengths and ideas, they both built strong and profitable businesses. In short, people who enjoy and celebrate other people’s success end up attracting successful people with whom they can collaborate. Ultimately, these competitive partners motivate and inspire each other, leading to great success for all involved. We tend to think that success falls from the sky, like Cinderella’s fairy godmother turning her into a princess with the wave of a magic wand. But in the real world, things are rarely like in the fairy tales. Success often comes only after a long road of failure, and that’s why mentally strong people know how to persevere and treat their failures as stepping stones to something greater. There is no better example of this than Thomas Edison. He was one of the greatest inventors in history, perhaps most famous for inventing the light bulb, a discovery that completely changed the world. Just imagine, for a second, a world without light bulbs! But Edison also invented the electric pen, as well as a ghost machine. If you’ve never heard of these don’t worry – both were complete failures. And they were far from being Edison’s only flops. Even so, Edison didn’t consider these attempts to be failures. Instead, he saw them as learning opportunities, chances to experiment with what worked and what didn’t. Each time he failed, he considered himself to be one step closer to succeeding. The power of this way of thinking has been demonstrated by research. Studies have shown that work is probably more important than talent when it comes to success. For example, people who practice consistently for ten years, never giving up despite constant failures along the way, often end up being better at a given skill than those who at first seemed naturally talented. This applied to chess players, athletes, musicians and visual artists. And after 20 years of determined work, even individuals who at first seemed untalented could achieve world-class standards. So failure is a part and parcel of success. But, still, no one likes to fail, and most of us still hold onto the notion that failure is almost shameful. The key to overcoming the fear of failure lies in self-compassion and changing the way you think about failure. Take a 2012 study, in which students who had failed on a test were given the chance to take it again to improve their scores. Results showed that those students who took a more self-compassionate view of their initial failure, and thus didn’t take it as a massive blow to their self-esteem, studied 25 percent more for the second test and got higher scores than those who were disheartened by their initial failure. Thus, it’s important that you learn to be self-compassionate about your failures and mistakes. When you find yourself alone, with time on your hands, do you immediately switch on the TV or seek some outside activity for distraction? Most of us are accustomed to being surrounded by noise all day. What’s more, many of us actively try to maintain these noise levels throughout the day to drown out our internal thoughts and worries. This is not a wise habit. Mentally strong people are not afraid of spending time alone. They know that those quiet times when you are attentive to yourself can be a great source of rejuvenation, inspiration and reflection. Here’s how to do it yourself. Take a quiet moment to think about your life goals and whether you are on track to fulfilling them. It’s also a great time to listen to your feelings and notice if there is stress or negative emotions that need addressing. Finally, use this opportunity to think about new goals and new dreams, and to visualize the life you want to have. To stop yourself from forgetting these important musings, collect them all in a journal. Another secret weapon in the mentally strong’s arsenal is meditation. When you’ve become comfortable sitting down alone to confront whatever is spinning around in your head, meditation can help you become more resilient. The effects of meditation have been the subject of much research in the last decades, and studies have found that meditation can actually alter the structure of the brain, with positive effects on cognition and emotional regulation. Meditation has also been shown to have positive effects on physical ailments, such as breathing difficulties, tumors, insomnia, chronic pain and cardiological problems. If you are still in doubt about the powers of meditation over the body, just look at the Dutchman Wim Hof. Also known as the Iceman, Hof has trained his body through meditation to withstand extreme cold. He regularly spends more than an hour bathing in ice and has been halfway up Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts! Luckily, today, meditation is generally recognized as a powerful tool for professionals of all kinds, so you don’t have to worry about being considered odd if you take a break to meditate at work. Many children grow up with their parents telling them they are brilliant, talented and destined for great things. It’s a natural impulse to want to tell your children nice things – but you’re not doing them any favors by doing so. Take the example of Ethan Couch. In 2013, this Texan teenager killed four people while driving under the influence. His lawyers in court actually argued that Couch could not be held accountable for his actions, because he was too privileged and suffered from what they called “affluenza.” According to his lawyers, the wealthy, coddling environment Couch grew up in meant that he was not able to take responsibility for his actions. Amazingly, this line of argument worked, and Couch received a probation and rehabilitation sentence, rather than prison time. But it isn’t just the wealthy who suffer from a sense of entitlement. It’s increasingly common to hear people tell their failing friends things like “Don’t worry, something better will come your way,” or “You deserve something good to happen to you after all this.” The problem with this growing sense of entitlement is that it prevents people from earning things based on actual merit. If you’re constantly focused on what you think you’re owed, why would you work hard to get anything? Mentally strong people are different. Instead of expecting the world to shower success and good fortune on them, they concentrate on giving. Take the example of the activist Sarah Robinson. Sarah found out that she had a brain tumor when she was in her early twenties. She battled for a year and a half before she eventually succumbed to the disease. But during that year and a half, she refused to believe that the world owed her something because she was unlucky enough to have cancer. Instead, she focused on what she could do for others. For example, as she spoke with other cancer patients in Maine, she realized that many lived far from the treatment centers and had to drive back and forth for hours every day in order to receive treatment. So she founded an overnight house near the medical facilities and funded it with the help of the Rotary Club. Today, although she has passed away, the overnight house is maintained by her family and friends. They undertake a lot of voluntary work to raise the necessary funds and keep “Sarah’s house” running. Do you keep your New Year’s resolutions? Probably not. A 1972 study that looked at whether people succeeded with their New Year’s resolutions or not  found that 25 percent of participants had abandoned their resolutions after 15 weeks. In a similar 1989 study, that number had gone down to only one week! The underlying issue is that our goals and expectations are unrealistic. As we never get anywhere near them, we get fed up and give up. So how can you ensure you set more realistic expectations? Here are a few simple rules: First of all, don’t think that change is easy. Accept from the start that reaching your goal will be tough. This is especially important if your goal involves giving up bad habits, like giving up smoking. These habits are often far deeper ingrained in our behavior than we think; you’ll have a greater chance of succeeding if you simply accept that it’s going to be hard. Secondly, don’t create a fixed deadline to reach your goal. It’s good to have an approximate idea of when you would like to get your result, but don’t make it an all-or-nothing situation. Some programs advocate losing a bad habit in 21 days, but if it takes you 101 days, that’s also fine. All that matters is picking a rough time scale that you feel comfortable with. Finally, don’t think achieving your goal will make your life suddenly wonderful. Losing ten pounds, often amounts to just that – some weight loss. Don’t expect to also get a promotion and a new lover. By following these steps, it will be easier for you to stick to your plan in the long haul without being disappointed. This brings us to another feature of the mentally strong, namely that they recognize that progress is not always immediately recognizable. Sometimes improvements are well-hidden, and sometimes they even look like steps backward. For example, the author once worked with parents of young children, teaching them how to manage temper tantrums. The standard advice was to studiously ignore the kids when they threw themselves on the ground and started howling and kicking. Many parents initially complained. They said the tantrums were getting worse, as the children were screaming louder, making more of a fuss. Of course, the children were simply upping the ante. Angry at being ignored, they were trying their best to get their parents to cave in to their will. But if the parents persisted in ignoring them, the tantrums inevitably improved. What this example shows is that it’s important to be patient, stick to your goal and keep working at it, even when you’re not seeing any progress at a given moment. The key message in these blinks: To increase your mental strength and get more out of life, you should: 1. Refrain from feeling sorry for yourself. 2. Never give your power away to others. 3. Embrace change. 4. Avoid fretting about things you can’t control. 5. Stop worrying about pleasing everyone. 6. Never be afraid of taking risks, but be clever about which risks you take. 7. Resist the urge to dwell on the past. 8. Make sure to never make the same mistake twice. 9. Never be resentful of other people’s success. 10. Keep at it and never give up after an initial failure. 11. Face your fears of being alone and overcome them. 12. Be on your guard for feelings of entitlement. 13. Never expect immediate results and be patient.   Actionable advice: Become your own mental strength coach. Now that we’ve been through the 13 things the mentally strong refrain from doing, let’s look at how you can put what you’ve learned into practice. Quite simply, it’s not enough to just read these blinks – you need to try these methods out in real life. Starting today, think of yourself as your own mental strength coach and, on a daily basis, do the following: Monitor how you’re behaving. Are you shying away from daunting change? Are you repeating the same mistakes? If so, come up with strategies for how to change and use what you’ve learned in these blinks. Pay close attention to your feelings. Are you feeling sorry for yourself? Do you resent others for their success? If so, take a moment to reflect on these feelings and try to let them go, replacing them with more positive feelings. Examine your thoughts. Are you fretting over things you can’t control? Are your expectations unrealistic? If so, try to replace them with more productive thoughts.   If you keep this up, you’ll quickly be on your way to greater mental strength. Got feedback?

Very? Well, perhaps you don’t run a marathon every few months. But you’re probably healthy enough, which is the category that most people find themselves in. You might not be a dedicated athlete, but you move around enough to stay in shape. And that might be just fine for you. But did you know that with just a few changes, you could easily become a very fit person, able to take on challenges you never before thought you could achieve? These blinks showcase the highlights of the author’s 30 easy ways to become a fitter, stronger, healthier person. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how a microwave can help get you moving; why no exercise regimen is as important as a good night’s sleep; and why you need to be wary of electrical pollution. Let’s face it: you’re not as fit as you’d like to be. But that doesn’t mean you should just give up. The first step is learning what can be improved. Do you eat too many processed foods, drink too much alcohol or caffeinated beverages, or take paracetamol or other medications unnecessarily? These are the kinds of bad habits that lead to chronic inflammation and damage your body. Consuming these “bad” foods essentially wreaks havoc on your gut. You might not know it, but your gut is one of the most important systems your body has. It makes up three-quarters of your immune system! And yet so many people don’t properly care for their gut. Their poor diets strain their digestive systems, which leads to hormone imbalances, excessive hunger, fatigue and worse. It’s not just what you eat that can damage your gut, but your stress levels have a powerful impact, too. We accept stress as a normal part of our professional lives. But stress is dangerous. Constant stress increases levels of the hormone cortisol in the body. When it’s produced at high levels for extended periods of time, cortisol can harm bones and muscles, and disrupt normal hormone regulation. Our jobs and relationships aren’t the only sources of stress, either. Excessive exercise can stress your muscles and joints. Many think that staying active means exercising hard and pushing yourself to the limit. But guess what: people burn more fat by performing lighter exercises more frequently. By all means, keep up your heavy program if you like it! But do so only occasionally. Regular, light exercises will help you stay fit, and they’re much easier on your body, too. With these basics in mind, let’s move on to a more detailed fitness strategy. Wouldn’t it be great if you could wake up tomorrow and simply be healthier? But Rome wasn’t built in a day. A realistic plan for rebooting your body takes four to 12 weeks. So, let’s start with a solid first step: an assessment of your body. If you’ve been avoiding a check-up at the doctor’s, now’s the time to book an appointment. From blood tests to examining your family’s history of disease, it pays to be thorough. This check-up will help you identify problem areas or extra precautions you may need to take. Check if diabetes is prevalent in your family, for example, or if your thyroid isn’t functioning at 100 percent. The next step is to create a plan. What are your health goals? Do you want to lose a specific amount of weight, get fit enough to run a marathon or stop eating junk food once and for all? Define your goal and break it down into tasks you can achieve every day, from eating a certain amount of green vegetables to exercising for one hour each evening. But how do you stay on track? Easy! By measuring. Look at your goals and decide which metrics would be most helpful in assessing your progress. One metric might be your heart rate variability, which indicates how fast your heart reacts when you start exercising (the higher the better). Your gut has an important role to play, too. These weeks are your chance to clean all that bad stuff out of your body. Inflammatory foods that contain gluten, caffeine or artificial sugars have to go. Build a new foundation for better nutrition by remembering how food gives you energy. Carbohydrates and fats are the main sources of energy in the human diet. We tend to rely on carbohydrates for energy, and as a result, consume more carbohydrates than we should. This causes fat to accumulate in our bodies, and can even lead to allergies and other complications. So try to switch to getting your energy from healthy fats, and reduce your carbohydrate consumption. So you’ve built the foundations for a healthier body. But why stop now? There’s so much more to gain. Learn how to consume delicious things in a more sustainable way and take your body to the next level. Food, after all, should be enjoyable. And eating a restricted diet, while useful during a reboot, isn’t a long-term solution for your health. What you’ve got to work on now is reintroducing foods into your diet. Here it’s important to focus on only reintroducing foods with the least negative effects, and enjoying them only in moderation. For example, a small piece of dark chocolate every now and then can still be justifiable. Get your fix for wheat and grains by eating varieties that are soaked, sprouted or fermented. Quinoa is a great option. Dairy can also be a part of your diet, ideally raw or organically raised. Fermented varieties of soy, such as tempeh, are also good. Black coffee is a great way to start the day, and you can even indulge in a glass of organic red wine, on occasion. Measurement is just as important in this phase as in the previous one, so keep an eye on how your body responds to new foods. Everyone’s gut is different and sensitive to different things. What works for others may not work for you. At this stage, you’re also ready to start expanding your exercise routine. You’ll want to increase both your strength and lung capacity, combining slow training and high-intensity interval training. It’s important at this stage to keep your activity levels high by making movement an integral part of your day. For example, set up a pull-up bar at home and do five pull-ups while you’re waiting for the microwave to ding! And avoid sitting down for too long. Try experimenting with a standing desk – you’ll be surprised at how much better you feel after a few hours of not slouching in a chair! You can even bring movement into your social life by exercising with coworkers or signing up for running groups. It’s a great way to meet people and prevents your exercise routine from becoming stale. But we’re not finished! The next stage is about making living healthy instinctive. If you’ve come this far, your body is performing better than ever. If you’re ready to kick things up yet another notch, then it's time to get vitalizing. Start by incorporating new tricks into your training routine. When you perform daily exercises and sprint a few times a week, you’ll get tired and fatigued. But highly specialized training can fix that. For example, you can try hypoxia, the exercise of depriving yourself of oxygen for brief periods. You can do this by swimming 25 meters without breathing – it can help keep you fresh and fight off your body’s aging mechanisms. You can also test new strategies to develop stamina. In early stages, pushing your body to the limit is not recommended; but now that you’ve achieved peak fitness, you’re ready for more. Exercise at your utmost capacity at least once a month, and at most once a week. Just make sure you allow your body time to recover. You won’t get stronger unless your body can restore itself regularly. That’s why you have to change your lifestyle, as well, like by making sleep a very high priority. A healthy sleep rhythm is essential for maintaining health and fitness, and it’s no surprise: sleep is your brain and body’s prime time for recovery and repair. Eight hours of sleep is a minimum which should never be compromised – people who sleep any less tend to develop health issues. One trick for better sleep is to beware of electrical pollution. Since your cells’ ability to absorb nutrients depends on their voltage, it’s critical you stay away from areas with lots of electrical currents. You can do this by switching off your digital devices. There’s one last thing to remember in this final stage, and it might seem surprising. If you ever feel like “cheating” when handed a slice of cake, for example, sometimes it’s ok to give in. Cheating occasionally or eating something that’s not healthy is nothing to feel guilty about. In fact, eating a calorie-rich meal can even boost your body’s weight-loss ability, as the body’s hormone signals go into overdrive in response to a surprise treat. The key message in this book: Unhealthy eating, chronic inflammation, imbalanced hormones and poor training plans have wrecked our bodies and brains. You can change this situation not only through more training, but through a radical reboot of your body. Only then can you enhance your health and performance and push on to the highest levels of achievement.  Actionable advice: Get some air! We’ve been conditioned to spend our days indoors, sitting, without complaint. It’s time to break the habit and learn to love the outdoors again! Getting out is a great motivation to move. Locate your nearest parks, woodland reserves or even playgrounds. Make time in your weekly routine to lose yourself outdoors and reconnect with your body and local environment. Got feedback?

Finally he gives in and calls the engineer, who comes the next day, taps it on the side and presto – it starts running again. Faced with the bill, the man complains that he shouldn’t have to pay for a fix that took the engineer a few seconds. “Well,” says the engineer, “you’re not paying for the fix, but for the years of training it took to know exactly where to tap.” The point is, you don’t have to spend tens of years or thousands of dollars to fix most problems. Thanks to huge advances in psychological research and technology, we’re now able to “fix our boilers” in exceedingly simple ways. In fact, as these blinks show, we can often change something in less than a minute. Here are the top psychological tricks to improve yourself in all sorts of ways, from being more creative to spotting a liar. In these blinks, you’ll find out why the self-help industry’s obsession with visualization is misguided; how to use psychology to be more likable; and what one 19th-century French engineer discovered about working in groups.   This is a Blinkist staff pick “I love these blinks because of their surprising, and surprisingly easy to use, tips. The email technique to catch liars is one of my favorite little hacks ever.” – Ben S, Audio Lead at Blinkist Interviewers select job candidates based on the right qualifications and work experience, right? Well, not exactly. Studies have shown there is one factor that trumps all others when it comes to landing a job: Likability. Below are some simple tricks to make people like you. After following over one hundred former students hunting for their first jobs, researchers from the University of Washington and University of Florida found that those who secured the interviewer’s favor were the most likely to be hired. There were a few things that made them likeable: some spoke about interesting topics that were unrelated to the job, others maintained a genuine smile and some spoke highly of the organization they were applying to. This is good news, since these things are easy to do and make a huge difference. Another way to gain someone’s favor in an interview is to reveal your weaknesses right off the bat. In the 1970’s, Duke University psychologists conducted research where participants were presented with a recording of a man talking about his life. In one tape, the man confessed early on to getting caught cheating in school; in another tape, he left his confession until the end. The man was rated far more likable by those who’d listened to the tape in which he made an early confession. It’s therefore advantageous to save your positive aspects until the end of the interview. By doing so, it appears that you prefer letting your strong points come up naturally in conversation, which makes you more likable. Here’s one last interview tip: don’t freak out if you make a mistake. Chances are that a mistake is far more apparent to you than to others, and an overwrought reaction or apology will only highlight something that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Likability is not only crucial for interviews; it’s also a huge advantage for your social life. In fact, if you’re not likable, the odds are against your making many friends or being persuasive. It may come as a surprise, but competent people actually appear more attractive and likable when they falter, rather than when they try to be perfect. Consider how President Kennedy handled the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Though the attempted invasion of Cuba was a complete catastrophe, it actually resulted in an increase in Kennedy’s likability, as he made no excuses and shouldered full responsibility for the failure. To investigate this further, the author assembled an audience and chose two actresses to demonstrate a blender. One actress performed perfectly and appeared highly knowledgeable. The other messed up: the blender’s lid came off and she spilled fruit juice all over herself. Although the crowd found the perfect person’s demonstration professional and convincing, the second actress came out on top in terms of likability. When asked to explain their ratings, people said they couldn’t identify with the flawless demonstration of the first actress but warmed to the second actress, who showed a more human side. Note that this effect only arises when you are already seen as competent. If you’re an average performer, making mistakes will cost you and make you look unappealing. But if you’re skilled at what you’re doing, don’t worry about perfection. The occasional slip-up is endearing! Here’s another thing that’ll make you more likable – avoid gossip. Ohio State University researchers conducted a study about how gossips are perceived. Participants were asked to watch a video in which actors spoke disparagingly of a third party. Surprisingly, the participants perceived the actors as possessing the negative traits that the actors attributed to the third party! So, if you want to be seen positively, simply say positive things about others. In recent years, everyone in the self-help industry seems to be getting on the visualization bandwagon. It’s touted as the way to achieve your goals: simply picture yourself getting into those jeans and voilà! But several scientific studies tell us that visualization isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. In one study from the University of California, students were asked to imagine, for a couple moments each day, that they’d received a high grade and how good this made them feel. Another group of students were not asked to do anything. After recording how many hours the students studied each day, the results showed that the visualization students studied less and had lower exam grades than the other group, even though the visualization exercise took only a few minutes to do. Researchers postulated that those who fantasize about a great life don’t prepare for setbacks and so lack the mettle required to achieve their goals. So what does work to effect positive change? Creating a plan. The author once carried out a study tracking 5,000 participants with different goals, ranging from losing weight to quitting smoking. Those who reached their goals were the ones who had a plan. The best way to plan is to break down your goals into subgoals, and create a step-by-step process. With these less-intimidating steps, you’ll feel less fear and hesitation. And that’s how you get into those jeans. Another effective approach to accomplish your goals is to tell them to your friends and family. Psychologists have long known that people are more likely to follow through with their plans and promises when they’re public – so get them out there! Most people see brainstorming as a fantastic creativity booster. This probably came down to us from the 1940s, when advertising executive Alex Osborn claimed that working in a group could yield twice as many ideas. A large body of research, though, suggests that brainstorming causes us to repress, rather than form, creative ideas. In the 1880s, a French agricultural engineer conducted a study in which he asked participants to pull a rope to lift heavy weights. He found that when working alone, individuals could lift around 185 pounds. But when they were in a group, this dropped to 140 pounds per person. This happens because when we work in groups, responsibility becomes diffused. When we’re alone, however, our success or failure is ours alone. Brian Mullen‘s research at the University of Kent at Canterbury confirmed this. He found that participants working independently produced a higher quality and quantity of ideas than those working in a group. But apart from working independently, how else can you be more innovative and creative?  Try looking to your subconscious mind. To receive new painting ideas, Salvador Dali would lie on a couch with a spoon in his hands. As he drifted off to sleep, the spoon would fall out of his hand and onto the floor. The sound would wake him, and he would immediately start sketching while still in this slightly altered, more subconscious mindset. It’s no news to most people that our subconscious mind is capable of incredible things. But we do need to learn how not to oppress it with our conscious mind. Psychologists from the University of Amsterdam discovered that people are more creative when their conscious minds are distracted, thus giving space to the unconscious mind to generate creative ideas. So when you need to solve a problem, turn your attention to a puzzle or something that’ll distract your mind from the issue at hand. Your unconscious mind will work away on the problem in the background and you’ll have a greater chance of finding a solution. So many of us struggle to be creative, but it doesn’t have to be so hard. In fact, your ability to be creative can be improved by a few quick and easy changes to your surroundings. Our environment shapes our mind, which in turn influences our reactions. Being shaped by our environment is called priming, and it happens even when you’re not consciously aware of it. So, for example, if you add a subtle scent of cleaning spray to the air, people in that atmosphere are primed to clean up more carefully. But how can priming enhance our creativity? In one experiment conducted by Jens Förster at the International University Bremen, participants were asked to write a few sentences on punks – their behavior, appearance and lifestyle. Punks were chosen because they’re anarchic and radical. Another group was asked to do the same, but about a typical engineer, who’d be considered conservative and logical. Then they took a standard creativity test. The result? The group that primed with thinking about punks turned out to be significantly more creative than those who thought about the engineer. You can use this knowledge by taking a few moments to describe a musician or artist. List their behavior, lifestyle and appearance. Entering that mindset will pave the way for your own creativity. Another quick way to foster creativity is to add plants and flowers to your surroundings. These reduce stress and induce good moods, thereby enhancing your creativity. In one study, researchers asked a group of people to execute various creative tasks in rooms with plants or with racks. It was found that the addition of the plant raised people’s creativity significantly. Another study of workplace creativity from Texas A&M University revealed that placing flowers and plants in an office resulted in a 15 percent increase in idea generation from male employees and improved the problem-solving abilities of female employees. Whether it’s a breakup, illness or just daily stress, everyone experiences events that make us anxious, unhappy or even depressed. The good news is, there’s a short exercise you can do to alleviate your stress. In such situations, people seek distraction, but this solution is only momentarily effective. Instead, you should opt for a benefit finding solution. That is, try to single out positive aspects of the hurtful event. It’s a quick method that has been shown to help people in even extremely trying circumstances. In one study conducted at the University of Miami, over 300 undergraduates were instructed to select an incident in their lives by which they’d been hurt or offended. One portion of the participants was then asked to take a few minutes to detail the event and focus on how it affected them negatively. The others were asked to focus on the benefits that emerged from the experience – things that, for example, made them a stronger or wiser person. The results revealed that those who focused on what they gained from their experience were better equipped to cope with their anger and unhappiness. But what about extreme cases? While it does sometimes seem impossible to see the silver lining in dire situations, there is evidence that positivity can result from them, too. Research shows, for instance, that certain positive character traits, such as gratitude, hope, kindness, leadership and teamwork, increased in Americans after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Other studies have also shown that having a serious physical illness can result in raised levels of courage, fairness, curiosity, humor and appreciation of beauty. All of us could probably do with a little help in our relationships. So what are some quick skills we can learn to help keep them on the right track? Relationships thrive on mutual support and agreement. But, as we are acutely attuned to our partner’s comments, even the slightest sour remark needs to be sweetened with love and attention. Psychologist John Gottman discovered this during his research on what makes couples stay together or break up. Gottman analyzed the role of positive comments in agreements, understanding and forgiveness, and negative comments in opposition, criticism or contempt. What he found was that for a couple to live happily ever after, positive comments must outnumber negative comments by around five to one! Apart from showering your darling with positive comments, what else can keep your relationships healthy? Try writing about your thoughts and feelings. To study ways of improving relationships, psychologists at the University of Texas sorted 80 new couples into two groups. One group had to take 20 minutes a day for three consecutive days to write down their thoughts and feelings about their relationship, and the other simply had to write about their days. After three months, 77 percent of the first group were still together, compared to 52 percent of the second group. Here’s one final way to enhance your relationship: use the word “but.” In one study by psychologists Sandra Murray and John Holmes, couples were interviewed about their partner’s most positive and negative qualities. After following the participants for a year, the successful relationships were those where the partners tended to qualify any criticism. So the husband was lazy but made his partner laugh. The wife was a terrible cook but that meant dining out more often. The simple word “but” enabled couples to smooth out the negative effect of their partner’s apparent faults and view the relationship differently. Can you spot a liar? They probably make big gestures or anxiously tell elaborate tales when they’re trying to cover something up, right? Well, that’s not what psychologists have found. Some research suggests that people who are lying are no more stressed than those telling the truth. In 2008, researchers at the University of Southampton took the pulse of students while questioning them about their grades. Almost 50 percent exaggerated their successfulness, yet they were no more stressed than their honest peers. According to researchers and trained observers, liars are just as likely to look you in the eye as those telling the truth, and they don’t in fact move anxiously or fidget in their chair. So the belief that lying makes us anxious isn’t reliable. So, how can you catch a liar? A liar is likely to seem like he’s thinking too hard for no good reason. Liars also adopt an impersonal tone and try to evade questions. To lie, you need to keep in mind what other people already know, what they could discover, what is plausible and what matches what you’ve already said. Let’s say you lied to someone about your evening plans. A few days later, the person you lied to asks you about it. Suddenly, your brain will scramble to recall everything you previously said and not create any contradictions. Because of this, when you lie, your physiology responds in the same way it does when you think about a problem. Often this means that, when lying, people don’t gesticulate as much, they take longer to answer and they pause and hesitate more often. Furthermore, they attempt to distance themselves from the lie by avoiding words like “I,” “me” and “mine.” Finally, liars tend to avoid answering questions about the issue and try to deflect attention from them by asking questions themselves. The key message in this book: You can significantly improve aspects of your life without much time or effort. The techniques in this book show you how to make quick and easy changes that enhance your creativity, likability, relationships and more. Actionable advice: Write your own eulogy. To help identify your long-term goals and progress toward making them happen, try an exercise where you write your own eulogy. Scientists believe that thinking about how you would like to be remembered after your death can reveal your true life-goals. Trap liars by asking for emails. If you want to minimize the risk of someone lying to you, interact over email. According to communication experts at Cornell University, people are 20 percent less likely to lie in an email, because their words are stored on record.

Many, like Ayelet Waldman, struggle enough to seek professional help. But after years of trying – and often failing – to find solutions to her irritability, anger, frustration and depression, Waldman turned to an unexpected source: the psychedelic drug, LSD. Placing two drops on her tongue, Waldman launched herself into an experiment to understand whether taking careful and tiny doses of the drug over just 30 days could help her toward a calmer, more accepting approach to life. In doing so, she also began an exploration into the misunderstood substance, its history and its potential benefits. Drawing on her former legal career – in which she saw firsthand the impact of the United States’ war on drugs – she reflects on the double standards and absurdities of a nation addicted to prescription drugs but willing to incarcerate millions for possessing a substance with a great safety record. Ultimately, Waldman was in search of the secret to having a really good day. Read these blinks, and you’ll discover whether she found it. In these blinks, you’ll discover how microdosing LSD works; why Steve Jobs and Nobel Prize Winners have attributed success to taking LSD; and how psychedelics like LSD can reduce anxiety and generate feelings of happiness, with fewer side effects than many prescription drugs. Ayelet Waldman had been at the mercy of her moods for decades. On a good day, she could be sparkling company – cheerful, friendly, affectionate and productive. But on a bad day, Waldman was worn down by self-hatred, guilt and shame. She’d start arguments with her husband, feel overwhelmed by pessimism and had little sense of self-worth, despite being a successful, published author. Her erratic moods have always made her life, and the lives of her friends and family, more difficult. Seeking help, she turned to therapy, spending many hours sitting on the leather couches of professionals – from Freudians to cognitive behavioral experts, social workers to family therapists. She tried mindfulness – spending long periods meditating and even longer telling her therapist how much she hated meditating. One day, crossing a bridge while driving home, she found herself considering steering to the right and hurtling into the water below. Shocked at this suicidal thought, she sought medical help. Diagnosed with a form of depression – bipolar II disorder – she started taking drugs. For years, Waldman tried numerous medications: Celexa, Prozac, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Effexor, Lamictal, Adderall, Ritalin and many more. Some helped a little, for days or even months at a time. But they had unfortunate side effects, such as weight gain, irritability and a decreased interest in sex. Eventually, she discovered her diagnosis hadn’t even been correct. She realized her moods were fluctuating in direct correlation to her menstrual cycle, and that she had a type of premenstrual syndrome – called premenstrual dysphoric disorder – that caused mood swings at certain points in her cycle. This discovery allowed her to learn the cycle and timing of her moods and take medication only when necessary. But when Waldman entered the perimenopause, her period became irregular, and so did her mood. Things took a turn for the worse, and she became exhausted with fury, irritation and despair. It was at this point that she happened upon the work of James Fadiman, a psychologist and former psychedelic researcher. Fadiman was popularizing the microdosing of LSD – people taking tiny doses of LSD to treat mood problems were reporting that they’d enjoyed a really good day. And a really good day was all the author had ever wanted. Microdosing is such a new concept that Waldman had to teach her computer’s spell-checker to recognize it. The principle of microdosing is simple: The patient takes a tiny dose of LSD on repeating three-day cycles. On day one, you take your dose and monitor your mood, physical sensations, productivity and general experience of how the day went. On days two and three, you take no LSD but continue to monitor. On day four, you take your microdose and repeat the process. The dose in question is, at most, one-tenth a “normal” dose of LSD. Your typical LSD user in search of a trip – hallucinations and an altered consciousness – might take around 100-150 micrograms. The author, like other microdosers, would take just ten micrograms at a time – two tiny drops. The theory of microdosing is that the ten micrograms should be enough to deliver an improvement in mood but without any possibility of hallucinations or other noticeable physical or mental effects. Having learned of microdosing, Waldman was curious, but she was cautious about whether or not to proceed. She had some knowledge of drug issues and their use, having been involved in drug reform issues as a lawyer, but had never taken LSD. As a yoga-pants wearing, Instagramming, Starbucks-drinking, all-around law-abiding mother of four, the idea of becoming, in Fadiman’s words, a “self-study psychedelic researcher” felt ridiculous. But she was suffering from her moods. Even worse, her family were suffering too. So she decided to microdose for a month. Wary of buying drugs herself, she tracked down a microdoser who was able to give her some of his supply. She tested it, to be safe, using a drug testing kit purchased on Amazon. She took her first dose, and had a really good day. On her first day of microdosing, Waldman felt a little different, as if her senses had been heightened. She was more aware than usual of the scent of jasmine in the air and how beautiful the trees in the garden looked. She realized that she felt mindful – able to notice her thoughts and the feelings of her body. Thinking of her family prompted no annoyance, only a sense of love. She had a far more productive day than usual, and for the first time in a long while, felt happy. On her second day, a transition day when she took no LSD, she felt a little more like her usual self again, but still had the sense that it was easier than usual to ignore her bad mood. Day three in the cycle acts as a control day – giving her the experience of a “normal” day so as to allow better judgments about the impact of the dose. She felt her usual, irritable mood return and missed the peace and productivity of the previous two days. As Waldman’s experiment progressed, she found significant benefits to microdosing. On day four, she realized that she had more control over her impulses and irritability. Her kids messed around over breakfast and ended up late for school, but instead of yelling, Waldman felt unusually unphased. Her dog jumped up and caused her to spill tea over a book, but as the dog sat looking sheepish, expecting a scolding, Waldman just gave it a stroke. Happy at her improved mood, Waldman began looking into what LSD and other psychedelics actually do to you. They increase the interaction between serotonin, glutamate, and other factors in the brain, leading to the development of new neural connections and networks. This can help people develop new perspectives on things, such as their own problems. Researchers at UCLA and NYU have recently been able to show that psychedelic treatment can help reduce anxiety and improve the mood of patients facing death. This seemed to fit with Waldman’s experience. After a week, she was feeling different – more capable of dealing with anxiety and irritation, more productive and, well, happier. Her early conclusion was clear: either the microdosing was working, or she was experiencing one hell of a placebo effect. LSD was first synthesized by a Swiss research chemist named Dr. Albert Hofmann in 1938. He consumed the drug throughout his entire life and lived to be 102 years old. Hofman’s longevity might surprise the many people who believe that LSD is a dangerous drug. The truth is, despite its bad reputation, LSD is extremely safe. The author had heard rumors about LSD – that users experienced flashbacks for the rest of their lives, that people threw themselves off buildings thinking they could fly and that there were links between LSD use and psychotic episodes. But there’s plenty of evidence for LSD’s safety: According to a thorough 2008 review in the respected journal CNS: Neuroscience and Therapeutics, there’ve been no documented deaths from LSD overdoses. Other studies show that taking as much as 200 times the dose Waldman was taking would cause no noticeable biological effects – although probably one hell of a trip. Even the worst incidents of LSD overdoses are somewhat reassuring. In 1972, eight people were admitted to the hospital in San Francisco after accidentally snorting vast quantities of LSD, believing it to be cocaine. Five of the eight slipped into comas, while the others vomited continually. Within twelve hours, however, all eight had not just survived, but completely recovered. There are, however, some signs of adverse psychological reactions to LSD use. Very small numbers of people, most of whom had existing psychiatric illnesses, have experienced psychosis or other adverse effects. But the stories Waldman had heard – about people jumping off roofs, or committing suicide? They were merely urban legends. In fact, a recent study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that lifetime psychedelic use actually correlated to a 36 percent reduction in suicide attempts. LSD is unfairly maligned, perhaps, because in the 1960s the drug came to be linked to the youthful counterculture and associated social upheaval of the decade. Young adults protested the Vietnam war, supported the civil rights struggle, smoked pot and dropped LSD. The drug has had a bad reputation ever since. But the overwhelming evidence is that LSD use – even at levels far higher than the microdosing Waldman was administering – is safe. Furthermore, lots of evidence suggests it has positive effects. Let’s take a look. If you’re reading this on an iPhone, iPad or MacBook, you might just have LSD to thank. Steve Jobs, the legendary co-founder of Apple, took LSD and said that it was one of the most important things he ever did. While microdosing, Waldman experienced far greater flow – the experience of being immersed in, and fully concentrating on, her work. And Waldman and Steve Jobs are not the only ones to credit LSD for helping with their work. Kary Mullis was co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, in recognition of his work on the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which enabled gene cloning, DNA sequencing and other breakthroughs. Mullis said that taking LSD was a mind-opening experience, one that was more important than any of the courses he took. He doubted whether he would have invented PCR were it not for LSD. These anecdotes are backed up by research. One recent study – using MRI machines to follow the brain’s reaction to LSD – found that the drug generates a sort of hyper-connectivity, as ordinarily unrelated regions of the brain communicate with each other. That, it appears, enables new ideas and breakthroughs to emerge. Earlier in his career, James Fadiman ran an experiment to explore whether psychedelics could inspire creativity. He recruited senior research scientists from innovative businesses, including a few who would go on to design silicon chips and invent the computer mouse. All of them had thorny problems they were struggling to solve. They were each given a 100-microgram dose of LSD, while Fadiman observed, guided and conducted psychometric tests. The results were incredible: While the participants’ performance on psychometric tests improved, more compellingly, they reported experiencing sparks of intellectual intuition that solved many of their problems. Fadiman claims that a number of patents and products emerged from the session. Not long afterward, the authorities changed their minds about letting Fadiman research psychedelics. LSD’s bad reputation had struck again. But even today, many high-powered professionals in numerous fields are using LSD. Its popularity in Silicon Valley has surged, as startup employees and tech bros try to stimulate their neural connections. Of course, its use remains completely illegal. What’s the worst possible side-effect of microdosing LSD? The risk of getting arrested. Although Waldman only ever had a tiny quantity of LSD in her possession, it was still enough to face a sentence of up to three years from a state court. If you consider who the majority of prisoners guilty of drug offenses are, you’re probably thinking of a dealer caught in possession of a few weeks supply. The reality is that simple drug possession in the United States is prosecuted with great vigor, and prisons are full of people caught with modest quantities of drugs like LSD or marijuana. Over 40 percent of drug possession arrests are for the possession of a drug that 19.8 million Americans have used in the last four weeks. Half of all federal prisoners are doing time for drug offenses, and the majority are low-level offenders. Waldman herself was at relatively little risk of prosecution – indeed, she felt able to write about her experience. Why? Because she is white and wealthy. America’s war on drugs has always had a racial and class element. The very first antidrug laws – created to outlaw opium in the 1870s – were focused on poor Chinese immigrants, while society ignored the large numbers of white, middle-class people addicted to laudanum. Early twentieth-century antidrug campaigns talked of supposedly drugged black people attacking white women, while warnings of the “Marijuana-Crazed Madman” from Mexico weren’t far behind. This racism is still evident today: for every white person convicted of drug offenses, ten African Americans are incarcerated – despite the fact that white people are five times more likely to use drugs than African Americans. The war on drugs has seen prison populations rise, and African Americans suffer racial prejudice – but for what? People are still taking drugs, many of which, like LSD, are mostly harmless. Drug production and trafficking lies beyond the reach of regulation and taxation – funding violence and crime while drugs like heroin and cocaine get cheaper and cheaper. Researcher James Fadiman once believed that Sandoz Pharmaceuticals – the company that originally discovered and synthesized LSD – could’ve released a microdose version of LSD to the marketplace that could compete with the likes of Ritalin and Adderall. Unfortunately, after the drug was made illegal in the 1960s, that became an impossibility. Nonetheless, informal research into microdosing LSD has continued, largely led by Fadiman. Already researching the use of psychedelics, he once came across a woman who told him of her experiences with microdosing. Interested, Fadiman put together a protocol based around the same three-day model that Waldman used and published it in a 2011 book. Since then, Fadiman has received around 300 requests for his protocol, and 50 reports back from people who’ve used it. Just two of those 50 people reported negative reactions to microdosing. One person stopped the protocol halfway through the month as a result of extreme tiredness on the second and third days – the days after a dose was taken. Another simply reported that they stopped due to changes in their life circumstances. It’s possible, even likely, of course, that some of the 250 people who didn’t report back had a negative experience. But the overwhelming picture from those reporting back to Fadiman was positive. Most people reported a mixture of emotional, intellectual, and physical benefits, as well as improvements to their personal relationships. Users reported reduced anxiety, greater acceptance of life and its minor problems, greater creativity and focus and reduced conflict with their friends and families. Others commented on unusual effects: One person reported experiencing less depression in the face of their Parkinson’s disease, although the symptoms had continued. A person with a stutter saw a clear alleviation of symptoms, while a marijuana user – and in another case, a smoker – were both able to kick their habits. Fadiman’s research is, of course, no substitute for a proper clinical study into microdosing. He hopes that someday there will be formal research conducted into microdosing’s effectiveness and safety. There are already two potential projects underway in Australia and Europe, so it’s possible that a microdosing study will become a reality in the near future. At the end of 30 days, and ten tiny doses of LSD, Waldman reflected on her experiences. The only days when she had felt any abnormal sensations – mental or physical – were the days she’d taken a dose. She occasionally felt dizzy or nauseous on the day of a dose, and sometimes felt more likely to become irritable on a microdose day. On the following days, she simply felt happy, optimistic and relaxed – far better than she usually felt before her microdosing experiment. One microdose day, Waldman had a major fight with her husband. Even then, she reported some positive signs. Normally when fighting with her husband, she ends up feeling intense shame – triggering guilt and, in turn, depression. During her microdosing month, and particularly on this occasion, Waldman felt she was more forgiving of herself after the conflict and less quick to fall into shame. Perhaps the best indication of microdosing’s impact came from Waldman’s family: Told that she’d been experimenting with a mood medication, Waldman’s children were unsurprised, having observed clearly improved moods and behavior during the month. Her younger daughter said that even when angry Waldman had seemed much more under control. One of her sons commented that she’d merely been nicer and happier, while another said that she’d dealt with stress without yelling or shouting. Looking back over the thirty days, Waldman came to the conclusion that she’d both felt and behaved differently. For once, she’d been able to look back at the end of the day, and think - that was a good day. Her experiment left her positive and hopeful for the future, but also facing a paradox. She lives in a drug-obsessed nation, where ten percent of the population are taking antidepressants, and she’d finally found a drug that seemed to work. But her drug was completely illegal. Taking a benzodiazepine – an addictive drug that can cause Alzheimer’s – would be completely fine. A doctor would happily prescribe it. But a tiny dosage of a drug with no apparent mental or physical side effects? For now, that remains a crime. The key message in these blinks: Society's attitude to drugs is entirely wrong-headed. Vast numbers of people take large quantities of often addictive and potentially harmful drugs in an attempt to tackle mental health problems, with very limited success. Meanwhile, we incarcerate millions of people for taking drugs that are no more harmful, but just happen to be illegal. With LSD microdosing illegal, despite its apparent benefits and lack of harm, we potentially deny many people the possibility of experiencing more really good days.  Got feedback?

Halford","summary":"Do you sometimes feel that there’s so much more you could do with your smarts, only something is always holding you back, be it brain fog, the lure of the World Wide Web or something else entirely? Chances are, you’re not alone: The market is teeming with attractive guidebooks for brain-owners. So why should you read these blinks? First, they’re honest: They don’t promise you’ll become the next Einstein in the course of a few weeks.  Second, unlike other programs, these blinks don’t require you to quit your day job and center your whole life around your new brain exercises. Instead, you’ll find simple, practical advice that helps you to make the best of the fine brain you have – with just a few small lifestyle changes, like eating more berries.  Third, all the advice you’ll find is based on solid science.  And lastly, it’s a quick and pleasant read. Reading these blinks, you’ll find out why we’re not all that different from chimpanzees; why back slaps can improve the performance of a basketball team; and how jogging can help your brain repair itself. Ninety percent of our knowledge of the human brain has been acquired in the last 20 years – and we’re still far from fully understanding it. One thing we do know, though, is that our brains aren’t that different from the brains of our closest mammalian relatives – chimpanzees. Our brain is divided into three main parts, each with distinctive functions, and two of these parts are similar to the brains of apes. The first part is known as the reptilian brain. This section regulates the bodily functions we don’t consciously control, like breathing and sweating. Second is the mammalian brain, which constantly scans our environment for danger or reward. It’s also the emotional hub of our brain, dealing with feelings and memories. Although we share these parts with apes, the third section is what sets us apart. This is the prefrontal cortex, namely the human brain. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for reason, analysis, and the handling of emotions that stem from other parts of the brain. Imagine the mammalian brain as a kindergarten: everybody is running amok and doing as they please. When the preschool teacher – the human brain – walks in, the chaos is brought under control and order returns. We need our mammalian and human brains to get on well with one another, otherwise we would continuously fall victim to our impulses. Say your boss is rude to you and you feel a sudden urge to slap him in the face – this is the knee-jerk emotional reaction of the mammalian brain. But if you pause for a breath, you’ll realize that slapping your boss wouldn’t just be a step back in your career, but could also result in a lawsuit. So you decide to calm down. This is your prefrontal cortex doing its duty and preventing you from impulsive behavior. Sometimes even the most basic activities like showering or walking the dog seem like insurmountable chores. Blame it on your brain chemicals. Our brain chemicals regulate our mood, and in order to function well, our brain needs just the right amount of them. What’s more, the cocktail of chemicals needed can change on a daily basis, for example, when we hear some bad news or get a lousy night’s sleep. We also need certain brain chemicals to help us scan the world for potential dangers and react. For instance, when we feel threatened, our brain releases the chemicals adrenaline and cortisol. While both helped humans survive throughout evolution by increasing their focus, when daily stressors leave you saturated in them, they can be harmful and even cause diabetes, cancer or immune system deficiencies. Then we have three chemicals that regulate reward: dopamine, which induces pleasure; norepinephrine, which sparks interest; and oxytocin, which helps us trust and bond with others. Luckily, we do have some influence over this composition of chemicals and therefore over our feelings. Basically, we respond to most situations in one of two ways: we approach or avoid. Take work as an example. Do you go to the office because you enjoy it? Or do you begrudgingly haul yourself there just to avoid becoming homeless? Well, the good news is that you can shift your focus to a more positive one and by doing so, trick your brain. Seeing the positive side of things will make your brain release fewer stress hormones and produce more rewarding hormones, which will motivate you and help you achieve what you want. Say someone starts a diet to lose weight. If they look at the diet as deprivation – no more chocolate – they’re less likely to succeed than the person who associates the diet with a healthy, beautiful body, thereby choosing approach over avoid. Many things in life come without a guarantee that everything will work out, be it a marriage or the decision to move to another country. But perfectionism is not the answer. In fact, expecting or waiting for everything to be perfect can kill your confidence and make you feel really insecure. All these things relate to control, or rather, a lack of it. Fortunately, there are ways to reinforce your sense of control and feel more confident. Begin by changing your attitude. Scientists assert that people are either internally focused, feel in charge of their fate and able to change things, or externally focused, believing they’re helpless and blaming others for what happens to them. To focus internally, always consider what you can do to make changes and achieve your goals. Say your company advertises a job that you would jump at the chance to do, but an MBA is required, and you don’t have one. Instead of criticizing the company, you could talk to the HR manager about some possible alternatives. Another way to regain control, especially if you are afraid of failing, is to prepare yourself for everything that could go wrong. So, if you’re stressing over what could go wrong during a presentation – for example, your file doesn’t open or you forget an important part of your speech – then in your mind, rehearse how you would handle each situation. This will help you prove to yourself that you’re equipped to handle even the worst-case scenarios, and boost your confidence. Being in control also makes you feel really good. When you’re confident you can deal with a situation, your brain releases reward hormones like dopamine – instead of stress hormones – lifting your mood. Remember the last time you really wanted something and actually got it? Chances are, a bit of willpower was involved. Willpower is paramount to success and it has been proven that people who have strong willpower are more successful. One study by psychologist Walter Mischel in the 1970s showed exactly this. Mischel left some children alone in a room and told them not to eat a marshmallow that was placed in front of them. Some kids ate the marshmallows, some didn’t. The children who refrained from eating the treat grew up to be more successful and healthy than the children with lower willpower, who scoffed the marshmallow. Successful people also tend to focus and manage distractions well. Contrary to popular belief, our brain isn’t built for multitasking: it can only focus on one activity at a time. So when we “multitask” we’re actually shifting back and forth between different tasks, which not only increases the chance of slipping up, but also wastes more time. As if that wasn’t bad enough, an interruption of 4.5 seconds triples the amount of errors made in the task at hand, and one hour of well-focused time is equivalent to four hours of time rife with distractions. Once you have willpower and focus, it’s time to learn exactly how to set your goals. According to research, people perform better when they’re observed. This is all the more reason to tell your friends about your goals! Secondly, don’t set lofty goals for the long term. Immediately achievable wins are far more motivating, so break down your huge goals into smaller chunks. If you want to lose 60 pounds in six months, set an initial goal of losing ten pounds in four weeks. When you reach it, your brain will reward you with dopamine which will motivate you to carry on. Do you enjoy people-watching at airports and cafes? Do you get a kick out of gossiping at work? You’re in good company – we’re hardwired to take an interest in others. But what about forming relationships and gaining trust? Let’s take a look at how our brain regulates whom we trust and bond with. Whenever we meet another human being, our brain changes a little bit and reshapes with every interaction. This is probably the reason why the number of people you are able to have a stable social relationship with is limited, and that number normally hovers around 150. When we first meet someone, our brain actually triggers a threat reaction, making us nervous and eager to give the best possible impression. But, once we get to know the other person better, this threat reaction subsides, and our oxytocin increases. In fact, oxytocin is always involved when people trust each other and emotionally connect.   But what factors help us trust and bond with others? Reliability, generosity, laughter and shared memories. All it takes is thanking others, high-fiving or hugging more often – if appropriate! One study showed that basketball teams perform better when they give more high-fives and back slaps. Doing so generates oxytocin, which likely increases trust within the team. Active-constructive responding is another effective technique to enhance trust. That means acknowledging what people tell you in a positive way by displaying interest and offering constructive comments. For example, if your colleague tells you they’ve won an important client, don’t just say “Great!” and then point out that this will mean crazy amounts of work. Instead, say something like “Wow, that’s great news! I know you’ve been sweating over that for a while. Happy to hear it’s paid off!\" Several studies have shown that we’re smarter when we’re with others. Teams achieve better results than any solo expert on a given topic. Clearly, we should try to collaborate more with others. Working with others shouldn’t be a chore, though, since it increases not only our productivity, but gives us joy, too. By reaching a goal with others, we feel more joy and happiness than if we had gotten there alone, and this is because with others our oxytocin levels rise. Shared joy is magnified joy. From some studies we know that coactive working – meaning working in the same office on independent projects and sharing information – increases happiness and productiveness. The best results, however, are achieved through interactive working, that is, people working together toward a common goal. So in what ways can we increase and improve collaboration? Well, when you start work on a proposal, ask your colleagues for their input. Not only will you gain a lot from their opinion but you will also enhance the trust and closeness in your relationships. Why? Because we find people more pleasant and trustworthy if they ask us for help. And when you ask others for help, you will also appear more trustworthy and nice to them. Bear in mind that collaboration doesn’t mean agreeing on everything. People should be expected to have different views. Just aim to exchange opinions in a respectful way and don’t assume your idea is the best! We all approach problems differently and by sharing ideas you’ll be able to find the optimal combination of solutions for any situation. Finally, remember to practice constructive criticism: criticize the idea, rather than the person, and offer concrete, actionable suggestions. Do you love doing cryptic crosswords or getting your head around some sudoku? Great – these activities help your brain to reshape and grow, reducing the chances of you developing dementia.  This kind of mental exercise is fantastic, but what about physical exercise? We all know physical exercise is great for general health, but do you know just how much it improves the health of your brain, too? Exercise releases a chemical known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which helps our brains to grow, improves the quality of connections between synapses and repairs damaged cells. The same thing takes place when we engage in mental exercise. If you exercise regularly, you’re probably familiar with that rewarding post-workout feeling. This is because you’re experiencing your brain producing chemicals that reduce anxiety and increase your confidence. What if you hate sports, though? Start small. Even getting off the train one station early on your way home makes a difference. To enjoy a healthier brain, you also need to eat and drink enough of the right things. Your wellbeing and productiveness rely on your brain’s energy levels, and to function well it needs glucose, oxygen, fat and micronutrients. A lack of these things can lead to feelings of tiredness and confusion. Next, you must drink water. 75 percent of our brains are made out of water, and dehydration causes our gray matter to slow down. That means if you want to think on your feet and stay focused, you need to down enough glasses of water every day. Finally, opt for natural food instead of processed food. You can also go for food that has special benefits for the brain. These include berries, which aid memory; apples, which help synapses to connect better; cocoa, for reducing the risk of strokes; and nuts and seeds to slow down cognitive decline. Do you sometimes feel like you can’t catch a break from daily stressors? Well, it’s time to get a handle on them. Ongoing stress is the main risk factor for many brain diseases, depression and dementia. Fortunately, there are ways to dial down the stress and keep your brain fit. One of the easiest ways is sleep. While we slumber, we process the information from that day and store the relevant parts in our memory. Getting sufficient sleep also improves our cognition and mood, making it easier for us to learn and be creative. On the contrary, sleep deprivation overloads our brain with the stress hormone cortisol, resulting in memory problems and a decrease in our ability to learn. Along with sleep, resting and “mental wandering” throughout the day is important for the brain. You can slow the decline of your brain health by resting enough. Awake rest is vital for your brain – it means relaxing without doing anything productive. Your brain needs these pauses to function well and it actually aids your productivity, so don’t feel guilty for spending an entire day just reading or walking your dog! Another reason to chill out: while we’re distracted, our subconscious mind works away in the background on our problems. Our subconscious is a wonderful problem-solver. That’s why we often come up with great ideas in the shower. So whenever you’re trying to wrestle a problem to the floor, drop it, walk around the block, and come back to it later. The key message in this book: Bonding with others, developing a positive attitude, reaching goals, increasing productivity and preventing mental decline all start by knowing how your brain works and how to handle it. By eating and drinking healthily, getting adequate rest and sleep, and engaging in mental and physical exercise, you can get the most out of your brain and your life. Actionable advice: To keep your brain healthy, learn. When you learn something new, like a language, your brain has to work hard by establishing new neuronal connections, which keeps it healthy and prevents it from developing dementia. The best way to learn something new is heuristically: that is, practice as much as you can and learn through trial and error. This will increase your intuitive knowledge of the subject you’re learning. So, if you’re learning a new language, for example, you should speak it, read it, listen to it and write it as much as possible.  Ration your inbox time and eliminate pop-ups. Even a brief distraction can be incredibly detrimental when you’re absorbed in an important task. Two useful things you can do to avoid this when working on your computer is to disable popup notifications and only check your mails at fixed intervals throughout the day, for example 9am, 2pm and 6pm.

We often want to completely rethink the way we live – the problem is, that never works! There are plenty of reasons why you don’t have to completely transform your life in order to feel more charged, to feel those bursts of energy and happiness that we all seek. For example, instead of thinking about how our lives can be happier, we should be thinking about how our lives can be more meaningful. As you’ll see, once you have found meaning, happiness will follow. Taken together, these blinks show you simple ways in which you can use three keys – energy, interactions and meaning – to get fully charged in your professional and personal life. In these blinks, you’ll learn how much sleep top performers get per night; what can prevent those intense cravings for sweets; and why making more money won’t make you any happier. We all want to be happy. In fact, we want it so badly that we’re willing to chase happiness for our whole lives. But few of us realize that the pursuit of happiness is in fact our greatest obstacle to it. The truth is that happiness isn’t something you can achieve by seeking it; rather, happiness is a by-product of living a meaningful life. So where can we find meaning? Though we’ve been taught to find fulfillment and satisfaction in our careers and wages, these don’t have the power to make you happy. US-wide surveys showed that even a sudden doubling of income produced only a nine percent increase in life satisfaction. Money and success are external motivations, and are not sustainable sources of meaning or happiness in the long run. Internal motivations, on the other hand, give us a powerful way to experience meaning in every action we do. Think about it: most jobs were created because they help other people, create progress, improve efficiency or produce something people need. You don’t need to be the head of an international NGO to change lives – you can find meaning and internal motivation in any situation. If you work in a call center and use your warmth and understanding to help a stranger out in even the smallest way, you’ll give both them and yourself a positive charge.  You’ll also double the charge if you can combine your strengths and interests with what others around you need. Remember: meaning does not happen to you, you create it. Be honest: how much of your day do you spend proactively pursuing your own well-being? Probably not a lot. In fact, you’re likely spending far more time responding to external stimuli, such as your smartphone notifications and other distractions. Lapsing into this state of passive reacting can be dangerous. A study of smartphone users has shown that phones are unlocked an average of 110 times per day, and nine times an hour during peak evening hours. But this is just a fact of modern life, right? Well, this constant activity is more damaging than you might think: a 2015 study discovered that the pressure people feel to respond immediately to a smartphone notification is associated with worse sleep quality, more sick days and a higher probability of mental and physical burnout. If you want to manage these passive reactions, there are techniques that can help: switch off automatic notifications, and set specific times for checking your emails and social media accounts throughout the day. Not being disturbed by notification alerts, even for short periods of time, will make a massive difference for your productivity. If you’re still having trouble overcoming distraction, try taking a minute to write down the things that seem to waste your time most often, like that new game you downloaded on your phone. Now that you’ve eliminated your passive reactions, it’s time to start initiating! But be careful – we often tend to mistake certain activities for progress, even when they’re not productive at all. If you find yourself keeping busy all day without actually getting anything done, this applies to you! Spending all day responding to emails might feel like you’re getting stuff done, but you’re not actually proactively initiating anything yourself! To avoid disguising passivity as productivity, the author reminds himself that instead of considering himself “busy,” he simply needs to manage his time better. If you feel stuck and unable to begin initiating, start with simple things: try striking up a conversation with somebody new. In fact, even short interactions with those around you have great benefits for your well-being. Find out more in the next blink! Exchanges with people around you, no matter how brief, can give your day a positive or a negative charge. So how can you keep your day on the positive side? Always assume people have positive intentions. Let’s say somebody bumps into you and spills your coffee without apologizing. Instead of getting angry, consider whether the person has a serious problem on his mind and didn’t even notice bumping into you. It’s rare for people to actually have bad intentions! If you assume people have negative intentions toward you, it’ll only make you angry and will give you a negative charge for the next minutes, hours or days. Instead, assume that people only mean the best, and you’ll be doing the best for your well-being too! Another good way to boost your daily positivity levels is by paying attention to how your conversations unfold. A great rule is to keep 80 percent of your conversation positive. You can do this simply by using positive words. Did you know that every negative comment needs four positive ones to make a person feel neutral? People are more likely to listen and be receptive when most of the conversation is positive. If you’re flooding a conversation with negative words, others will most likely shut off. You might think that yelling criticism at somebody will get his attention, but chances are he’ll just stop listening. We can see our own performance improve exponentially when our self-confidence increases, so why not give the gift of encouragement to others! Remember to praise and recognize your peers, focusing on their hard work and successes and helping build their self-confidence.   But not all compliments are made equal; the most lasting comments are sincere and specific. This will help others see what they do best and believe it. So instead of merely saying “good job” after a coworker’s presentation, tell them that they explained it in a sophisticated and engaging way. After all, that’s the kind of compliment you’d like to hear yourself! Another secret to feeling fully charged is to spend time on the right experiences with the right people. Relationships are not only a key to making you happy – they can also boost your creativity and motivation. It’s important to choose your friends wisely, but why exactly? Well, those who you spend time with will influence your habits, choices and therefore your well-being, whether you like it or not. So if you want to grow into a better person, it’s definitely worth investing your time in those who care about your development. Often when we find ourselves swamped with work, it’s hard to even consider dedicating time to our social life without feeling guilty. But giving time to your friendships really takes no time at all! You can show your appreciation for those who support you by taking strolls together, or sharing a nice dinner. You’ll be surprised at just how much better you’ll feel afterwards, as these positive experiences have the power to put your problems into perspective. Positive experiences also have a lasting value, and this is largely because we remember these kinds of experiences with others even better than we expect to. One study asked participants to estimate how happy they’d be after an experiential purchase, such as a concert, a trip or dinner at a restaurant. Two weeks after the purchase, they were 106 percent happier than they’d expected they would be. As well as enjoying positive experiences long after they happen, you can also use them to lift your mood in the weeks leading up to them. When planning an activity, share it with others rather than keeping it a surprise; anticipation significantly enhances the experience. Research shows that looking forward to holidays increases well-being for weeks or even months. Besides refocusing your life on meaning and spending time on your relationships, the keys to feeling your best are eating, moving and sleeping. The next blinks will explain this further. You make a decision with every bite you eat. Food is fuel, and it’ll give you the charge you need if you eat right. But with all the bizarre fad diets out there, how can you know which one will actually lift your energy levels? In the end, it’s not all that complicated, nor does it require a total dietary makeover. You can start by adjusting and swapping the core elements of your diet. Avoid fried food, products with processed sugar and carbohydrates. Instead, gradually start building your meals around veggies and whole fruits. Swap your sugary energy drinks for water, tea or coffee. Large-scale studies show that even a slight increase in protein intake alongside a decrease in carbohydrates has positive effects on your health. An easy shortcut can help you with every day shopping decisions: try to avoid food that has a carbs to proteins ratio higher than five to one. Next time you’re at the supermarket, check the nutritional values to ensure you avoid these foods. A study done by the University of Missouri confirmed that a protein-rich breakfast increases the level of the brain chemical dopamine, which reduces cravings for sweets. So if you want to eat less sweets, start eating more protein: eggs, nuts, seeds, salmon or lean meat. Finally, prepare healthy choices in advance to avoid any tempting last-minute decisions. Plan your shopping beforehand and avoid the sections with unhealthy food. Reorganize your kitchen so the healthy food is more visible and easily accessible, keeping it at your eye level or stored in visible places. And don’t forget to bring small bags of fruits, veggies or nuts with you when you leave home, in case you feel like snacking. Nowadays, people spend more time sitting than sleeping. In the long term, this can have damaging effects on our health. When sitting, the electrical activity in our leg muscles shuts off, calorie consumption drops to one per minute, enzymes breaking down fat decrease by 90 percent and good cholesterol drops by approximately ten percent per hour of sitting. Sounds pretty frightening! But these negative impacts are easy to avoid. Simply stretching and standing up a few times an hour can make a huge difference. During exercise, our blood pressure and blood flow increase; this drives oxygen to our brain and allows us to think more effectively. In this way, just moving around can boost your concentration and mood for hours. A surprising research study discovered that just a 20-minute, moderate intensity workout can improve your mood for up to 12 hours after the exercise. Even walking increases energy levels by 150 percent. The benefits of moving around are clear, so how can you start making it a bigger part of your day? Study your surroundings for ways to increase your activity. One easy way to do this is by rearranging your home and office to encourage movement instead of convenience. Let’s say you often print documents in your office – make sure the printer is not within your reach so you need to stand up every time you fetch your printed papers.   Measuring your activity also motivates you to move more. During one experiment, people who were assigned to track their activity moved 27 percent more, simply as a by-product of measuring their movement. Use a health-tracking device – like an app or a pedometer – to track and set your activity levels. According to the author’s research, 10,000 steps per day is a good target to set. So, for those of you who say you’ve got no time to exercise, no more excuses! If you want to be more efficient, add exercise to your schedule and start saving time in the long run. In today’s business world, we perceive a proper eight-hour sleep as an unnecessary luxury or a sign of laziness. But don’t be fooled! One less hour of sleep doesn’t equal one extra hour of achievement or experience. Insufficient sleep decreases your well-being, ability to think and your productivity, and also harms your health. Research show that elite professionals sleep an average of eight hours and 36 minutes per night. The same study also indicates that frequent resting improves performance, as it helps prevent exhaustion and promotes full recovery. Harvard Medical School even found that sleep insufficiencies cost the American economy $63 billion a year due to lost productivity. Your sleep quality is itself influenced by your activity during the 90 minutes before you go to sleep. A 2014 study found that late-night smartphone usage has a significant impact on sleep quality. That’s right, your pre-sleep scroll of social media feeds is enough to make you fatigued and less engaged at your workplace the next day. To ensure stress-free and quality sleep, avoid using electronic devices at least an hour before going to bed – being exposed to bright lights before bedtime also decreases your sleep quality. Sacrificing sleep has diminishing returns, and won’t give you the charge you deserve. So, if you have a lot of work to do, sleep more, sleep well and take regular breaks to keep your performance and efficiency at their highest levels. The key message in this book: Despite what you’ve been told, prioritizing your well-being and relationships won’t take a toll on your work performance. Instead, you’ll become more effective, organized and productive. Learning to start living meaningfully and actively is what will help you live happily in the long run.  Actionable advice: Hide your phone during conversations. Having your phone visible when you are around others will immediately decrease the quality of your interactions. This is the so-called iPhone effect, and a 2014 study confirmed that the mere presence of a mobile device (even if switched off) made conversations less fulfilling. Another study found that a visible cell phone had negative effects on attention and on people’s ability to perform complex tasks. So, leave your phone in your bag and encourage your relationships to flourish.

You might need a minute to think about that question, because habits are, by definition, behaviors that we perform automatically, with little or no thought. From making a coffee when we get up in the morning to brushing our teeth before bed at night, our habits subtly guide our daily lives. As a result, you may not realize how much power there is in habits. If repeated every day, even the smallest actions, from saving a dollar to smoking a single cigarette, can accumulate force and have a huge effect. So understanding and embracing habits is a great way to take control of your life and achieve more. Over the course of these blinks, you’ll learn precisely what habits are, how they are formed and how you can harness them to change your life for the better. In these blinks, you’ll learn why modern life makes our brains’ natural wiring somewhat inconvenient; how a cat in a box advanced scientific understanding of habit formation; and what a nice new soap in a Pakistani neighborhood can tell us about building habits that stick. Imagine a plane taking off from Los Angeles en route to New York. If, during takeoff, the pilot decided to adjust course 3.5 degrees to the south, the plane’s nose would move just a few feet. Outside of the cockpit, no one on board would notice the small movement. But over the course of a journey across the country, the impact of the change would be considerable, and the confused passengers would alight from their plane in Washington, DC, not New York. We don’t notice tiny changes, because their immediate impact is negligible. If you are out of shape today, and go for a 20-minute jog, you’ll still be out of shape tomorrow. Conversely, if you eat a family-size pizza for dinner, it won’t make you overweight overnight. But if we repeat small behaviors day after day, our choices compound into major results. Eat pizza every day, and it’s likely you will have gained considerable weight after a year. Go jogging for 20 minutes every day, and you’ll eventually be leaner and fitter, even though you won’t have noticed the change happening.   If you want to make a positive change in your life, you should recognize that change requires patience, as well as confidence that your habits are keeping you on the right trajectory – even if you aren’t seeing immediate results. So if you find that your behaviors and habits don’t seem to be paying off, try to focus on your current trajectory rather than your current results. If you have little money in the bank but you are saving something each month, then you can be confident that your trajectory is right. Your current results might not be great, but keep going in this direction and, in a few months or a few years, you will notice a major improvement. By contrast, a millionaire who outspends his earnings each month may not be worried about his bank statements from one month to the next, but, in the end, his trajectory will catch up with him. The key to making big changes in your life doesn’t have to involve major upheaval; you don’t need to revolutionize your behavior or reinvent yourself. Rather, you can make tiny changes to your behavior, which, when repeated time and time again, will become habits that may lead to big results. When you walk into a dark room, you don’t think about what to do next; you instinctively reach for a light switch. It’s a habit – a behavior that you’ve repeated so many times that it now happens automatically. So how are habits formed? Well, our brain figures out how to respond to new situations through a process of trial and error. Nineteenth-century psychologist Edward Thorndike famously demonstrated this with an experiment where cats were placed in a black box. Unsurprisingly, each cat immediately tried to escape from the box, sniffing at its corners and clawing at its walls. Eventually, the cat would find a lever that, when pressed, would open a door, enabling escape. Thorndike then took the cats that’d successfully escaped and repeated the experiment. His findings? Well, after being put in the box a few times, each cat learned the trick. Rather than scrambling around for a minute or more, the cats went straight for the lever. After 20 or 30 attempts, the average cat could escape in just six seconds. In other words, the process of getting out of the box had become habitual. Thorndike had discovered that behaviors that give satisfying consequences – in this case, gaining freedom – tend to be repeated until they become automatic. Like cats in the nineteenth century, we also stumble across satisfying solutions to life’s difficulties and predicaments. And, thankfully, we now understand a little more about how habits work. Habits begin with a cue, or a trigger to act. Walking into a dark room cues you to perform an action that will enable sight. Next comes a craving for a change in state – in this case, to be able to see. Then comes our response, or action – flicking the light switch. The final step in the process, and the end goal of every habit, is the reward. Here, it’s the feeling of mild relief and comfort that comes from being able to see your surroundings. Every habit is subject to the same process. Do you habitually drink coffee every morning? Waking up is your cue, triggering a craving to feel alert. Your response is to drag yourself out of bed and make a cup of joe. Your reward is feeling alert and ready to face the world. But, of course, not all habits are good for us. Now that we understand how habits work, let’s look at building positive ones that improve our lives. All of us have cues that trigger certain habits. The buzz of your phone, for example, is a cue to check your messages. And once you understand that certain stimuli can prompt habitual behavior, you can use this knowledge to change your habits. How? Well, one way is to change your surroundings and general environment to encourage better habits. Just take the work of Boston-based doctor Anne Thorndike. She wanted to improve her patients’ dietary habits without requiring them to make a conscious decision. How did she pull this off? She had the hospital cafeteria rearranged. Originally, the refrigerators next to the cash registers contained only soda. Thorndike introduced water, not only there, but at every other drink station. Over three months, soda sales dropped by 11 percent, while water sales shot up by 25 percent. People were making healthier choices, just because the cue to drink water rather than soda was more prominent. So simple changes to our environment can make a big difference. Want to practice guitar? Leave the instrument out in the center of the room. Trying to eat healthier snacks? Leave them out on the counter, instead of in the salad drawer. Make your cues as obvious as possible, and you’ll be more likely to respond to them. A second great way to strengthen cues is to use implementation intentions.  Most of us tend to be too vague about our intentions. We say, “I’m going to eat better,” and simply hope that we’ll follow through. An implementation intention introduces a clear plan of action, setting out when and where you’ll carry out the habit you’d like to cultivate. And research shows that it works. A study of voters in the United States found that the citizens who were asked the questions “At what time will you vote?” and “How will you get to the voting station?” were more likely to actually turn out than those who were just asked if they would vote.   So don’t just say, “I’ll run more often.” Say, “On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, when the alarm goes off, the first thing I’ll do is don my running gear and clock two miles.” Then leave your running shoes out where you’ll see them. You’ll be giving yourself both a clear plan and an obvious cue, and it may surprise you how much easier this will make it to actually build a positive running habit. In 1954, neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment to test the neurology of desire. Using electrodes, they blocked the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in rats. To their surprise, the rats simply lost the will to live. They had no desire to eat, drink, reproduce or do anything else. Mere days later, they all died of thirst. The human brain releases dopamine, a hormone that makes us feel good, when we do pleasurable things such as eating or having sex. But we also get a hit of feel-good dopamine when we simply anticipate those pleasurable activities. It’s the brain’s way of driving us onward and encouraging us to actually do things. So, in the brain’s reward system, desiring something is on par with getting something, which goes a long way toward explaining why kids enjoy the anticipation of Christmas so much. It’s also why daydreaming about your upcoming hot date is so pleasurable. We can also turn this knowledge to our advantage when trying to form habits. If we make a habit something we look forward to, we’ll be much more likely to follow through and actually do it. A great technique for this is temptation bundling. That’s when you take a behavior that you think of as important but unappealing and link it to a behavior that you’re drawn to – one that will generate that motivating dopamine hit. Ronan Byrne, an engineering student in Ireland, knew he should exercise more, but he got little enjoyment from working out. However, he did enjoy watching Netflix. So he hacked an exercise bike, connecting it to his laptop and writing code that would only allow Netflix to run if he was cycling at a certain speed. By linking exercise – literally – to a behavior that he was naturally drawn to, he transformed a distasteful activity into a pleasurable one. You don’t need to be an engineer to apply this to your life. If you need to work out, but you want to catch up on the latest A-list gossip, you could commit to only reading magazines while at the gym. If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls, promise yourself a half hour of ESPN after you talk to your tenth prospect. Soon enough, you may even find those unattractive tasks enjoyable, since you’ll be anticipating a pleasing reward while carrying them out. We often spend a lot of time on behaviors that are easy. Scrolling through social media, for example, takes zero effort, so it’s easy for it to fill up lots of our time. Doing a hundred push-ups or studying Mandarin Chinese, in contrast, requires a lot of effort. Repeating those behaviors daily until they become habitual is tough. So making behaviors as easy as possible is key to turning them into habits. Luckily, there are a few tricks we can embrace to make anything seem easier. The first is to focus on reducing friction. The author has always been hopeless at sending greeting cards, while his wife never fails to do so. Why? Well, she keeps a box of greeting cards at home, presorted by occasion, making it easier to send congratulations or condolences or whatever is called for. Since she doesn’t have to go out and buy a card when someone gets married or has an accident, there’s no friction involved in sending one. You can also use this approach to increase friction for bad habits. If you want to waste less time in front of the TV, unplug it and take the batteries out of the remote. Doing so will introduce enough friction to ensure you only watch when you really want to. The second trick for making a habit easier in the long term is the two-minute rule, a way to make any new activity feel manageable. The principle is that any activity can be distilled into a habit that is doable within two minutes. Want to read more? Don’t commit to reading one book every week – instead, make a habit of reading two pages per night. Want to run a marathon? Commit to simply putting on your running gear every day after work. The two-minute rule is a way to build easily achievable habits, and those can lead you on to greater things. Once you’ve pulled on your running shoes, you’ll probably head out for a run. Once you’ve read two pages, you’ll likely continue. The rule recognizes that simply getting started is the first and most important step toward doing something. Now let’s take a look at the final rule for using habits to improve your life. In the 1990s, public health researcher Stephen Luby, working in the neighborhood of Karachi, Pakistan, achieved a huge 52-percent reduction in diarrhea among the local children. Pneumonia rates dropped by 48 percent, and skin infections by 35 percent. Luby’s secret? Nice soap. Luby had known that handwashing and basic sanitation were essential to reducing illness. The locals understood this, too; they just weren’t turning their knowledge into a habit. Everything changed when Luby worked with Proctor and Gamble to introduce a premium soap into the neighborhood for free. Overnight, handwashing became a satisfying experience. The new soap lathered easily and smelled delightful. Suddenly, everyone was washing their hands, because it was now a pleasing activity. The final and most important rule for behavioral change is to make habits satisfying. This can be difficult, for evolutionary reasons. Today, we live in what academics call a delayed-return environment. You turn up at the office today, but the return – a paycheck – doesn’t come until the end of the month. You go to the gym in the morning, but you don’t lose weight overnight. Our brains, though, evolved to cope with the immediate-return environment of earlier humans, who weren’t thinking about long-term returns like saving for retirement or sticking to a diet. They were focused on immediate concerns like finding their next meal, seeking shelter and staying alert enough to escape any nearby lions. Immediate returns can encourage bad habits, too. Smoking may give you lung cancer in 20 years, but, in the moment, it relieves your stress and the craving for nicotine, which means you may ignore the long-term effects and indulge in a cigarette. So when you are pursuing habits with a delayed return, try to attach some immediate gratification to them. For example, a couple the author knows wanted to eat out less, cook more, get healthier and save money. To do so, they opened a savings account called “Trip to Europe,” and every time they avoided a meal out, transferred $50 to it. The short-term satisfaction of seeing $50 land in that savings account provided the immediate gratification they needed to keep them on track for the ultimate, longer-term reward.   However pleasurable and satisfying we make habits, we may still fail to maintain them. So let’s take a look at how we can stick to our good intentions. Whether you’re trying to write your journal or give up smoking, managing your own behaviors can be hard. Thankfully, there are a few simple measures that can help. Habit tracking is a simple but effective technique. Many people have kept a record of their habits; one of the most well known is founding father Benjamin Franklin. From the age of 20, Franklin kept a notebook in which he recorded adherence to 13 personal virtues, which included aims like avoiding frivolous conversation and to always be doing something useful. He noted his success every night. You, too, can develop a habit tracker, using a simple calendar or diary, and crossing off every day that you stick with your chosen behaviors. You’ll find it effective, because habit tracking itself is an attractive, and satisfying, habit. The anticipation and action of crossing off each day will feel good and keep you motivated. A second technique is to develop a habit contract that imposes negative consequences if you fail to stay on track. Bryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, took his habit contract very seriously. In a contract signed by him, his wife and his personal trainer, he committed to get his weight down to 200 pounds. He identified specific habits that would help get him there, including tracking his food intake each day and weighing himself each week. Then he set up penalties for not doing those things. If he failed to track food intake, he would have to pay $100 to his trainer; if he failed to weigh himself, he would owe $500 to his wife. The strategy worked, driven not just by his fear of losing money but by his fear of losing face in front of two people who mattered to him. Humans are social animals. We care about the opinions of those around us, so simply knowing that someone is watching you can be a powerful motivator for success. So why not set yourself a habit contract? Even if it isn’t as detailed as Harris’s, consider making a commitment to your partner, your best friend or one of your coworkers. If you agree upon a set of consequences for failing to follow through, you’ll be much more likely to stick to your habits. And as we’ve seen, sticking to a positive habit, however small, is a surefire way to achieve big things in life. The key message in these blinks: A tiny change in your behavior will not transform your life overnight. But turn that behavior into a habit that you perform every day and it absolutely can lead to big changes. Changing your life is not about making big breakthroughs or revolutionizing your entire life. Rather, it’s about building a positive system of habits that, when combined, deliver remarkable results.   Actionable advice Use habit stacking to introduce new behaviors.  If you want to build a new habit, you could try stacking it on top of an existing habit. Let’s say you want to start meditating, but you’re struggling to find the time. Try thinking about those things you do effortlessly each day, like drinking coffee in the morning. Then just stack the new habit on top. Commit to meditating each morning when you’ve finished your coffee, and build on the natural momentum that comes from a habit you already have. Got feedback?

How would you go about this task? You might struggle to make a start. In our working and family lives, we are constantly asked to tackle difficult problems, find ideas and develop good solutions. This is where the technique of freewriting comes into play. These blinks will introduce you to freewriting. Freewriting allows you to tackle problems, to think through ideas, to free and organize your mind, and to get creative. You will learn the golden rules of freewriting and how to get your best ideas on paper. In these blinks, you’ll learn why it’s better to give only 90 percent of your effort, not 110 percent; why lying is (sometimes) a good idea; and why you might consider publishing a book – after you’ve mastered your freewriting skills. You no doubt have tons of great ideas swirling around your head; you’re not alone if you struggle to articulate them. The human mind is capable of producing fantastic thoughts and hypotheses, but sometimes directing or clarifying them can be tricky. We all have eureka moments that come to us like lightning bolts – some are nonsensical, others can change the world. Remember the legend of the apple falling on Isaac Newton’s head? At that moment, he suddenly understood how gravity worked. There’s no doubt that the human mind can conjure up incredible leaps of imagination. However, sometimes we struggle to organize and refine our thoughts into understandable forms. That’s because we're predisposed to laziness or leaving our ruminations indistinct and wooly. We start daydreaming, lose focus, and just like that the best ideas are lost. There’s a method for combating this: freewriting. Freewriting is a way to arrange our minds, come up with ideas, or make decisions by putting our thoughts down rapidly on paper. It’s more than just directionless and unfocused scribbling. You have to apply rules and techniques in order to reap huge rewards from your initial thinking. Freewriting is a method that honors everything within your mind. It keeps track of it and permanently chronicles your opinions as they develop. It’s especially useful if you have to make difficult business decisions. But it’s also excellent in situations where you have to think about your personal life or get to grips with big challenges like writing a book or a thesis. But don’t be fooled by the name. Freewriting is relevant not just for authors, business consultants or wordy professionals – it’s for everyone. Now that we know the theory, how does freewriting actually work? Let’s get started by looking at some basic rules. Freewriting, despite the name, isn’t just “free writing.” There are rules to follow, so don’t rush headlong into the exercise. It’s important to grasp the three basics. First, temper your expectations. This will get you out of the starting blocks with ease. It’s called a try easy attitude. Let's look at a real-world example. The attitude was typified by business consultant and mental coach Robert Kriegel. He managed to get athletes to set world-beating records while competing for a spot in the Olympics. How? He told them to relax and give only 90 percent instead of 110 percent. The same mind-set applies in freewriting too. Don’t aim to produce flawless prose. Just smash out some decent words and thoughts. Begin by telling yourself to “try easy” and just scribble something without pressuring yourself. Secondly, write quickly and continuously. This will stop you judging yourself too soon. Aim for volume and don’t worry about the actual content for the time being. Write or type as fast as you can. If you hit a wall, try to keep on moving. Repeat the last words or phrase you wrote to keep the momentum up, even if it makes no grammatical sense! It's all about ensuring you don't get stuck in a rut. Quality isn’t of the highest importance for now. You can always go back to tweak and amend your work once it's on the page. Thirdly, work to a time limit. Setting a time limit for your session means you’ll maintain focus on your freewriting. That way you know when it’ll end. Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, works like this. He likes to write while his washing machine is on a laundry cycle. This way he can compartmentalize his writing and concentration according to the machine. Three rules down! Let’s look at three more in the next blink. Now you’ve got the basics, let’s look at three more golden rules for freewriting. First of all, write the way you think. This means writing for yourself and not an imaginary audience. You needn't over-explain, and you certainly shouldn’t worry about grammar. You’ll really feel the benefits if you’re not constrained by any style or grammar rules. Your mind can roam free. Consequently, explore anything that comes to you. You can skip around as you see fit. What does this mean in practice? Well, say you're describing a product you’ve recently heard about. If you produce a few paragraphs that are easy for others to understand, then you haven’t engaged your creative faculties. Try again and free yourself up! Second, go with the thought. Don’t feel bound by apparently false turns. There’s no need to go back and correct yourself. Just keep going. Maybe the problem you’re facing is complex, and there are many ways to solve it. Don’t get distracted. Follow one path and stick to it, so you won’t get stuck if your mind starts flicking back to think about different paths. Consider this analogy: Imagine you and a colleague find out that a computer at work is faulty. You want to search for the person who damaged the machine, but your colleague wants to fix the technical problem immediately. They’re both legitimate routes, but in freewriting, you can’t do both. So choose one path and stick to it. Finally, redirect your attention. You know that feeling when your mind is stuck, and you're unsure what to do? You can use focus changers to redirect your attention. Focus changers are questions you should have on hand. They help you decide if you should continue along a particular freewriting path or change direction. Keep them simple. Questions like “why?”, “what am I doing wrong?” and “how do I improve this?” will do. So, just what is the purpose of freewriting? What is it trying to achieve? Well, for starters, there are some obvious advantages over just mulling things over. When we think, our minds tend to wander. We get lost in thought. This means there’s a decent chance that great ideas will get lost in the melee and forgotten. However, if you write things down you’ll always have a record of what you thought and can trace your logic back. Imagine going to a supermarket. If you shop with only a mental list, there’s a high probability that you’ll forget something. However, if you’ve written your list down, the chances of forgetting, say, milk or eggs are considerably reduced. Freewriting preserves a record of your thoughts. This stops ideas from being lost in the ether. Before you start freewriting, you should prepare the ground with a few prompts. These will warm up your mind and help you later explore unforeseen directions. A prompt is the base line for your thinking and writing. Use a prompt as the starting gun for a session, or even as a signpost to send you off on new paths. Robyn Steely, executive director of Write Around Portland, a non-profit organization that promotes writing workshops, has some good tips. He suggests the best prompts are short and open ended. Something like \"After the storm . . .\" or \"I can still remember . . .\". Other examples of open phrases might include “If I didn’t have to work I’d . . . ” or “The best part of my workday is . . .”. It’s your job to complete the sentence as you see fit! A prompt is a fantastic warm-up tool. What’s more, a good prompt can easily push your thoughts into new and unexpected directions. When it comes to freewriting, unnecessary complexity is best avoided. Think in terms of melodies rather than symphonies. Keep things simple. In fact, in freewriting, too much complexity can get you into trouble. When a solution seems beyond your grasp, it’s often because you’re overthinking or prioritizing complexity over succinctness. You can escape this trap by working with facts. Facts are simple and concrete. What’s more, they can often set off a train of thought as you follow one fact to the next. For instance, a drop in company sales is verifiable. This leads to the discovery that weak productivity is affecting numbers, and this to the revelation that employee salary is too low to incentivize staff to work hard. One simple fact has set off a clear chain of thought that gets right to the heart of the problem. There’s another way to hone your freewriting skills: disconnect and abandon old ideas when new ones emerge. Disconnection is easy in theory, but you should try to do it actively. When you reject a hypothesis or trash a thought, try to find a lesson before moving on, but, whatever you do, keep writing. Write about why and how you abandoned the idea. You’ll find that it’s when you ditch ideas that don’t develop that freewriting starts to pay off. This brings us to the point of producing all this material. An abundance of ideas is better than a single one. Focusing on finding a perfect idea can actually be counterproductive because you demand too much of yourself too early. You can put this into practice. Try freewriting sessions where you come up with one hundred ideas for a problem. Take a few days to do it, and do it in more than one sitting. The ideas can be mundane, fanciful or even just plain silly – it’s a numbers game that will stop you feeling frustrated at not having the perfect idea immediately. All your life you’ve been told that lying is bad, but that isn’t true with freewriting. Lying is a good way of exploring ideas. Think of it as playing make-believe on a piece of paper. In freewriting, lying means breaking with reality. You can explore situations which might seem silly or even absurd on initial reflection. But by doing so, you can actively channel your freewriting sessions in new and fecund directions, ending up in unexpected places. When you're trapped in reality, your responses are limited. Lying is a fantastic way to bolster your freewriting efforts. Let’s think of an easy way to start lying. Say you’re writing about something “small.” Instead, think of it as “tiny” or “gigantic.” If it’s “important,” make it “crucial” or “ordinary.” If it’s “boring,” rebrand it as “pathetic” or “super exciting.” Repeat the technique as much as you need! Another way to boost freewriting is to imagine fictitious conversations. Create a roster of real or fictitious characters to ask you simple questions. They're there to motivate you to react. Particularly useful are characters who hold completely different points of view. That’ll really test your thought processes. Or maybe you could address a “future you,” and imagine how that person might be different. That’s also a good way to stimulate ideas. But you shouldn’t create characters who are too abstract, like God or Buddha. Characters who are too wise and successful, like Steve Jobs or Abraham Lincoln, aren't great either. You might feel a bit insecure expressing yourself to them! Your character should be clear and vivid rather than historical or too abstract. A best friend or a teacher you admired in school should work well. Freewriting sessions are a personal experience. Use them to explore your thoughts and probe your processes. They’re great for discovering fresh ideas and solutions. However, it's also good to share the results. If you circulate your writing, you can benefit from feedback. This will, in turn, help you organize your ideas all the better. A close friend or colleague is probably the best source of constructive feedback. She should be willing and have the time to read your writing. You should be clear about the kind of feedback you expect from her, too. You could prompt her with questions like “what works?”, “what doesn’t?”, “is it too much?” or “is something missing?” Another way to inspire and motivate yourself in freewriting is to gather stories from your everyday life. Daily experience can quickly become rich prose, especially when you’re short of material. Keep your eyes peeled and freewrite what you see. Begin by doing it just for a day. A short episode can be worked up in just a few minutes. After that, set aside whole sessions for these stories. Almost every event has a lesson in it. Look at it this way. If a story arouses your curiosity, it’ll probably engage other audiences too. Finally, if you’re stuck on complex problems, longer freewriting sessions can be helpful. Short five- to 20-minute sessions can work great. But if deep and involved thinking is required, or if you’re gathering material for a book, you could opt for freewriting marathons. Over several hours you can amass tons of fantastic material, but a little bit of strategy is important. Long freewriting sessions can comprise several smaller spells. Freewrite for 20 minutes then, instead of taking a break, reread your notes and flag what seems interesting. Delve right back in and try for another 20 minutes. Repeat. Before you know it, you’ll have completed a freewriting marathon. Have you ever thought about writing a book? The rules and techniques used in freewriting can be a great help. You’ll be able to thrash out great brainstorming sessions and solve whatever problems you're facing, but you’ll also accumulate loads of publishable material brimming with your greatest thoughts. For this, you’ll need to archive your freewriting. File away those golden nuggets with an inventory! Freewriting isn’t just a way to clarify your thoughts; you can also use the results for further research. It’s essential therefore to keep records of all your freewriting sessions. You never know when they can be revised and provide you with solutions in the future. A good filing technique is critical for this exercise. Your inventory should have themes like \"business,\" \"writing techniques,\" \"sales,\" or \"love stories,” depending on what you like to write. You can use these tidbits as the foundations for further work or as prompts for new freewriting sessions. You can even recycle them by adding them to later writing. At its best, freewriting can also produce a nutrient-rich culture for finished prose, whether for a book, a master’s thesis or a dissertation. If it’s polished prose you’re after, start with a few warm-up freewriting sessions. The topic itself isn’t important. Once you’re all warmed up, freewrite with a little more focus. You might have to aim for marathons rather than sessions. Simultaneously, try to build up your archive. Cut, rephrase and tweak the material. Keep things relaxed and limber, then start to link ideas together with transitions and new passages. Edit again and again, and before too long, you’ll have completed the manuscript! It’s clear freewriting can solve simple day-to-day problems. But with a bit of effort, the method can be adapted for more complex material. You might even get a book out of it. The most important thing? Keep on writing. The key message in this book: Never stop writing, even if you don’t know what to write. Just let it flow out. Follow the rules set out in the blinks, and before too long great ideas will start to emerge. Actionable advice: Try adjusting your writing processes. Once you have completed a few freewriting sessions, reflect on your writing. You can refocus by posing yourself new questions. These could lead you down a whole different path.

Put differently, are you thriving, or just surviving? It’s a question few of us can answer with a resounding yes. After all, being true to yourself and leading an authentic existence isn’t easy. How to be your best self might be the most important subject in the world, but neither parents nor schools usually teach us how to go about it. That’s where life coach Mike Bayer comes in. If you want to change your life but aren’t sure where to start, these blinks are for you. The result of years of deep reflection upon his own personal issues, Bayer’s hands-on guide to finding your best self is packed full of actionable ideas you can start using today to put yourself on the path to a better tomorrow. So read on to discover: how visualizing your best self can help you keep your anti-self in check; how to deal with your fears rationally; and why looking after yourself isn’t selfish. “You’re unique.” It’s a line you’ve probably heard a million times, but have you ever let it sink in? Nobody on Earth will know what it’s like to walk in your shoes. Every thought, experience and feeling you have is yours alone; there’s never been, and will never be, another you! Chances are, however, that you were never taught how to be your best self. You entered the world as a blank slate which your parents filled with their own failings and hang-ups. Then came school. Sure, you learned all sorts of things, but what about connecting with who you really are? It’s pretty much the most important skill in the world, but you won’t find it on any curriculum. The result is that we often end up leading lives which feel a little off. There’s a vague sense we’re not being our true selves, but we’re not sure what to do about it. So how do you become yourself? Here’s how the author breaks it down. We all have two types of self: a positive best self – the person you’d like to be more often – and a negative anti-self which stops you being that person. The key is to learn to tell which self is in control. The best way to do that is to flesh out these characters and give them recognizable attributes. Let’s start with the best self. On a piece of paper, write down all of your positive traits: the things you admire most about yourself but don’t always act upon. Think of adjectives like “friendly,” “logical” or “brave.” That might be hard – after all, it’s much easier to criticize than praise yourself – but stick with it. Next, put a face to that bundle of attributes. Does your best self have a specific gender? Is it an animal or mythical creature? What’s its superpower? The author’s, for example, is a wise wizard called Merlin while one of his clients has an upbeat squirrel called Ralph! Once you’ve settled on your best self’s appearance and character, you’ll want to sketch it. Don’t worry, this doesn’t have to be a masterpiece. The important thing is to have a representation to hang somewhere in your home to remind yourself of who you want to be. Next, we’ll take a closer look at your best self’s nemesis: the anti-self. Have you ever seen someone absolutely lose it while driving? Road rage causes a remarkable Jekyll and Hyde transformation: the kindest, most considerate people in the world suddenly turn into raging road hogs screaming at everyone around them. That’s a pretty good example of someone’s anti-self taking control. It’s the part of your personality that responds to situations in the worst possible way, especially when triggers remind you of old wounds and fears. Take the author’s friend Suzanne. She named her anti-self Road Rage Regina. What provoked Regina most were traffic jams on her daily commute. The reason? When she was in high school, Suzanne missed a lot of classes due to illness and spent months desperately struggling to catch up. Being out of control and worrying about being late for work triggered that old anxiety. The good news is that getting a clear idea of your anti-self gives you a much better chance of predicting when it’s likely to rear its ugly head. Think back to the last time you acted in a way that later made you think “wow, I really lost it back there.” Maybe you had an argument with a sibling, say, and hung up the phone. What you need to do is write down everything you don’t like about your behavior when your anti-self is in charge. Use negative adjectives like “careless,” “irrational” or “angry” to fill your list. Push past any sense of shame. Things look a lot scarier when they’re lurking in the shadows, so think of this as taking a flashlight to the problem. Now repeat what you did with your best self: put a name and a face to it! Remember, this is an exaggerated version of yourself, so don’t be afraid to make this character cartoonish. In fact, the more ridiculous your portrait, the easier it’ll be to remember the behavior you want to avoid in the future. Think of five recent situations when your anti-self was in control. Write down how it behaved and then compare it to what your best self would’ve done. Keeping that in mind will help you step back and make better decisions when you’re triggered rather than simply losing it. You might find this tough at first, but with practice, it can become second nature. Becoming your best self is a journey. That means you’ll face obstacles along the way. If you want to reach your destination, you’ll need to avoid potholes and other hazards. And the biggest obstacle you’ll encounter is fear. The best way to overcome it? Face up to it and be honest with yourself. Remember, fear is a habitual liar. It whispers in your ear that you’re not good enough or that other people are judging you. Eventually, you end up with an entirely distorted view of the world and waste precious time and brainpower mulling over what-ifs. That means you’ll become so consumed by worries about hypotheticals that you won’t get anything positive done. But here’s the good news: there are a couple of simple strategies to put your fears into perspective. The first step is to identify them. Grab a pen and write out this question: “What are the fears that have held me back from making changes to my life?” Take a close look at your answers – is there an overarching theme? Are you terrified of failure, for example, or what people think about you? Now you’re ready for the next step: putting your fears to the test. Like any other muscle, the brain can be trained. Negative thinking, however, usually means that you’re focusing on fear, rather than solutions. What you need is an action plan to beat fear, and here’s how. Jot down these three headings: “My fear is,” “It’s keeping me from” and “My plan to stop my fear becoming reality is.” So, say you’d love to quit your job and set up your own business but the prospect of financial ruin is holding you back. One solution would be to put enough money away to tide you over for six months and only quitting your job once you’ve saved that amount. Another great tool is visualization. Next time fear raises its ugly head, try out this technique. Close your eyes and imagine putting all of your anxieties into a massive cardboard box. Now shrink that box in your mind’s eye until it fits into the palm of your hand. Finally, picture yourself hurling that negative package into a deep, dark canyon and savor the feeling of relief that washes over you as you watch it drop out of sight. So far we’ve explored the internal part of your journey toward your best self. But what about your relationships with others? After all, as the English poet John Donne once wrote, “no man is an island.” In this blink, we’ll take a closer look at your social life, starting with why socializing is so important in the first place. All evidence points to the idea that socializing is great for your body and soul. Take a study carried out at the University of Michigan in 2008. It found that social interaction is basically like taking your brain to the gym. In other words, it’s one of the best ways of keeping your cognitive capacities in top shape. Then there’s the 2008 Gallup-Healthways survey of 140,000 Americans, which showed that people were happiest on days when they’d spent between six and seven hours socializing. That goes to show how important it is to build time for friends and family into your schedule. But you shouldn’t just be hanging out with people you already know. According to the author, there’s nothing more stimulating than getting out there and making friends. After all, that’s when you’re most likely to pick up new ideas. Inspiration isn’t likely to strike when sitting alone on your couch! So there’s the evidence, but here’s the rub: few of us are natural-born social butterflies and lots of us find socializing, particularly with people we don’t know, pretty awkward. Luckily, there are a couple of tricks you can start using today to help you socialize next time you find yourself at a gathering. One of the most common problems people face is struggling to find something to say. That’s easy to remedy: you just need to prepare yourself by thinking over some of the things you’ve recently learned or experienced. That takes the pressure off to come up with something on the spot and gives you a nice conversation opener. Paying attention to small details also makes a huge difference. Asking questions and listening attentively encourages people to open up. Then there’s also body language. It’s estimated that nonverbal cues account for a good 70 percent of all communication, so standing up straight, keeping your arms unfolded and making eye contact are great ways of showing that you’re present and engaged. A lot of your most important relationships put you in the role of a carer, nurturer and helper. Looking out for others is a key part of becoming your best self. But that’s only going to happen if you’re taking care of yourself. Fail to do that and you just won’t have the physical or emotional energy to be useful to anyone. Self-care, in other words, isn’t selfish – it’s what allows you to give to others! That means it’s vital to learn how to manage the stress and hustle-bustle of everyday life. Let’s take a look at some tools you can use to keep yourself healthy and well-balanced. One technique the author swears by is mindful breathing. One of the first things that happens when you’re feeling overwhelmed is that your breathing becomes more rapid. Stepping back and taking three or four deep breaths is a great way to calm your stressed-out mind and put things back into perspective. Another great stress buster is exercise. Aim to spend at least 20 to 30 minutes each day working out. That can mean a brisk walk around the block, a bike ride or a session in the gym – the key is to take your mind off things and get your blood pumping. Next on the list? Sleep. A good night’s rest is essential for your cognitive performance, so make sure you’re getting at least six hours of shut-eye every night. Keep your bedtime regular and avoid eating just before sleep. You also need passions to make your life meaningful and joyous. Whether it’s painting or baking, hobbies allow you to express your love of the world. But it’s easier said than done when you’ve got a job, chores and kids, right? Well, sure, finding time is tricky, but it can be done – just ask the author’s high-flying clients who regularly grind out long days in the office but still find time to pursue their interests. The best way of finding out where to fit your hobby in your everyday life is to ask yourself what it is that stops you from, for example, learning Italian or taking a walk in the park. Could you cut down on TV time or use your commute to listen to an audio course? How many times have you heard someone explain away their rocky relationships by saying “it’s complicated”? It’s a common enough phrase, but it’s downright misleading. The truth is that many of the issues you’ll face in your relationships come down to a pretty simple issue: unrealistic expectations. It’s not surprising that so many of us have such misguided views. We’re constantly bombarded by idealized depictions of love in movies, commercials and music. Just think of the standard summer blockbuster: there’ll usually be plenty of romance and passion but very little of the bad moods, midlife crises and rough patches which are part and parcel of long-term relationships. So let’s dispel a couple of myths that get in the way of you living your best life within your relationship, starting with the idea that a great relationship requires great romance. To put it bluntly, that’s a recipe for disappointment: constantly being swept off your feet just isn’t sustainable in the long run. Remember, there’s a difference between falling in love and being in love. Over time, the excitement that defined the first moments of your relationship gives way to something more realistic. That doesn’t mean that something’s wrong: it just means you’ve entered a new stage in your relationship which is all about a deeper sense of connection. Myth number two holds that great relationships are always harmonious. But in fact, arguing is a perfectly normal part of life as a couple. Even the healthiest partners fight, and it can actually strengthen their bond. After all, sometimes you need to release built up-tension. The key is to learn to argue the right way. Remember your anti-self? When arguing, you’ll want to make sure your best self is firmly in the driving seat. When tensions rise, take a deep breath and ask yourself what your best self would do rather than letting the anti-self take charge. Here are a couple of tips to help you keep things measured. First off, keep calm and don’t raise your voice. Yelling won’t help your partner hear your argument! It’s also a good idea to show you’re listening and to make an effort to emphasize the things you agree on. So, if it’s true, tell them you understand their point of view. Also, don’t walk away from the issue; even if you can’t resolve it right away, make sure to end the conflict by finding a workable compromise. The key message in these blinks: Being your best self is the most important thing we’ll ever learn, but it’s rarely taught. Neither schools nor parents really ever show us how to really be ourselves. Later on in life, we often find ourselves adrift – getting by and surviving, but rarely really thriving. But it doesn’t have to that way. By recognizing your best self and anti-self, overcoming your fears, learning to socialize more, taking care of yourself and banishing unrealistic expectations from your relationships, you can get past some of the most common obstacles to being your best self.  Actionable Advice: Integrate “quiet time” into your weekly schedule.  Have you ever wondered why people chant “om” when they meditate? Focusing their minds on that repetitive syllable helps them drown out distracting thoughts and worries that go with the hustle and bustle of modern life. You don’t have to take up meditation to put that idea to good use, though. The key is to find a quiet moment at least once a week in which you can simply be. Your quiet time doesn’t have to literally be quiet – in fact, some people find that listening to their favorite music with the volume turned up helps them to center themselves. If that doesn’t work for you, how about simply spending quality time gazing at your favorite painting or breathing mindfully? Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Scott","summary":"Imagine, just for a second, what our society would be like without critics. Who would take the time to dive deep into artworks and explain them to the masses? And how would you know which new movie to see at the cinema? That’s where critics come in. Love them or hate them, we need critics to be the judges of culture in society. By delving deeper into the art of criticism, we’ll discover the necessary role of the critic and how it fits into societies past and present. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how critics came about; why Moby-Dick only became famous decades after its author’s death; and what the digital revolution means for the future of criticism. We’re living in a fast-changing culture. From music to fashion, an underground hit can become a worldwide trending topic at breakneck pace. Criticism is much the same way – and that’s how it should be. While artworks themselves last for a long time, with our attitudes toward them changing over years and decades, criticism is fixed in a single moment. Take rock music, for instance. Though the genre was initially rejected by revered music critics, today rock’n’roll is recognized as a pivotal moment in musical history. The first negative critiques of rock music, on the other hand, became irrelevant. Often, when artists create work that breaks with the status quo and shocks society, criticism of this work changes over time alongside our understanding of it. Nevertheless, it’s the critic’s job to tackle the problem of examining art in the context of current conditions – even though their opinions and predictions could be contradicted or proven wrong by future cultural shifts. This is no small task, especially considering the sheer amount and range of works that require the intellectual scrutiny of the critic. Today’s critics are no longer just concerned with fine arts enjoyed by the elite. Traditionally “low-brow” forms of art also provide them with a wealth of interesting material to deconstruct. Even superhero movies tell us a lot about cultural attitudes today and are worth examining. However, our culture is also one that doesn’t respond well to criticism. Part of the critic’s task is to provoke thought, which often means articulating unpopular or controversial opinions. Backlash is to be expected. Even the author of this book sparked a heated online conflict over his biting review of The Avengers: Age of Ultron. On Twitter, the film’s star, actor Samuel L. Jackson, demanded that Scott find a new job, and thousands of fans were spurred on to attack Scott. But he wasn’t too concerned. The incident gave him notoriety as a critic and ensured that his job would never be in jeopardy. Of course, being a critic isn’t all about playing devil’s advocate. In the following blinks, we’ll learn about what makes criticism valuable. But first, let’s take a closer look at the intimate relationship between art and criticism. Oftentimes controversial critics will be branded “failed artists” by their detractors. However, many game-changing critics were successful as artists too. Take George Bernard Shaw, for instance. Not only was he one of Britain’s greatest playwrights, but also one of the greatest English-language drama critics who ever lived. T.S. Eliot and Samuel Taylor Coleridge are still studied in universities today for their work in literary criticism as well as for their poetry. So although critics and artists appear to be rivals, history shows us that this isn’t the case. On the contrary, art and criticism both draw strength from the same source: human creativity. T.S. Eliot noted that the only difference between criticism and art is that criticism can’t exist without having some piece of art to respond to. And yet, one could argue that much influential art arose from the artist’s responses to other pieces of artwork. All art is, at least partially, a commentary on the art that has come before it. Writers are readers, and musicians are listeners. Creative people have a desire to imitate, improve, subvert or experiment with the art they’ve encountered. In this way, you could even consider the artist an accidental art critic too. Many filmmakers from the Coen Brothers to Quentin Tarantino combine elements from films that inspired them with their own ideas to create unique visual and narrative experiences. Hip hop and electronic music artists constantly sample melodies, beats and fragments from other music and sound sources. They might be borrowing from existing artworks, but the results are often original and unexpected. Sampling, references, and mixing and matching influences might feel far removed from traditional critical journalism, but these acts of appraisal provide fascinating reflections on previous artworks and their new significance in contemporary cultural contexts. What is it about your favorite song that makes you love it so much? Is it the way the chorus just hits you, or that killer rhythm? Or is it because it’s the perfect blend of musical qualities that you’ve learned to love since diving into a particular scene? While some artworks may have a special impact on us because of our unique personal experiences, we also tend to seek out groups and communities that share our taste in visual art, music, fashion, film, and so on. This gives us a feeling of affirmation, belonging and community. If you’ve ever been in a cinema where the whole audience is laughing at a joke on screen, you’ve experienced this! For many young people, affirmation like this isn’t just found in local communities, but in online ones. Blogs, social media and other channels are all incredibly influential in shaping the tastes of individuals. Of course, our environments don’t shape our taste permanently, as both our interests and our settings are constantly changing. New stages in life can make our old passions seem outdated, unrefined or even plain embarrassing. And, as society enters new stages, our collective understanding of beauty can change significantly. For instance, in the eighteenth century, philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Edmund Burke argued for a “subjective universality” that meant that on a deeper level, all humans considered the same things beautiful. Today, however, we’re aware that cultural and commercial forces have a powerful influence over our tastes. It’s become a common cultural reflex to think twice and ask critical questions about our initial reactions to works of art. Sometimes, the truth hurts. Good thing we have critics! While most of us avoid expressing how we really feel to avoid hurting someone’s feelings, critics make it their job to speak their mind. All humans share the desire to express judgment. However, if we all acted upon this desire each time we experienced it, we’d be arguing nonstop. Early civilizations recognized this danger, and the critic was born. It’s believed that when humans began to draw, dance and make music, critics took up the role of upholding standards by making critical judgments based on the aesthetic standards of the day. This made critics both trusted and reviled by the public. They always told the truth, but this wasn’t always what the people wanted to hear. Throughout history, critics have been accused of bias when their opinions don’t affirm cultural beliefs. This is especially true today, thanks to a global culture filled with diverse and contradictory ideals. Still, critics wield an unusual power. For creators, this isn’t always pleasant. One scathing review is enough to shut down a Broadway show or nip a young author’s career in the bud. Even Moby-Dick, Herman Melville’s literary masterpiece, met with harsh reviews when it was first published, and Melville retreated into obscurity for the rest of his life. It wasn’t until after he died that the reviews, and eventually the book, were rediscovered. If it weren’t for the original published reviews, the book would have been entirely forgotten. Criticism provides us with thought-provoking commentary and valuable historical records. Despite this, modern society is skeptical about whether we need critics at all anymore. Nobody enjoys admitting that they’re wrong. But for a critic, sometimes it’s necessary to get things wrong first, as this helps all of us get it right in the end. By offering up their subjective opinions, critics can help us uncover universal truths about art and culture. When others disagree with this opinion, this kicks off discussions which ultimately help us come to a judgment that satisfies most, if not all, of the viewpoints involved. This is the principle upon which Rotten Tomatoes, a film review score aggregator, is based. By combining many subjective reviews by a wide range of different critics, the site produces a score to capture how society as a whole feels about a movie. Unfortunately, many contemporary critics attempt to shirk their responsibility for being honest in their critiques, and instead use superlatives and marketing-speak to avoid being wrong. Words like “captivating” and “mesmerizing” appear all too often in reviews today. These are essentially empty buzzwords. They might help a critic land his name and quote in advertising for the film, but detract from the most important function of critical writing: starting a conversation. Many of the classic films, novels and albums that we know and love today might not have gone down in history at all if it weren’t for critics. In an age where we have greater access to past cultural output than ever before, critics help us work out which works are worth focusing on. Critics are also able to enter into dialogue with their forerunners, correcting their judgments with the benefit of hindsight. In the 1930s and 1940s, film critics were lamenting the dying art of film as one zany comedy after another seemed to hit the theaters. New York Times critic Frank S. Nugent dismissed the screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby as just an unremarkable film in a collection of similar movies. Later critics offered a different take, thereby revitalizing the film and helping new audiences fall in love with it. Today, Bringing Up Baby is considered one of the best movies of all time. Something similar might happen to the superhero movies today. While many contemporary critics pan them as formulaic, over-the-top mass entertainment, some of them may later be immortalized as classic twenty-first-century cinema. Critics can also use their voices to get undervalued art onto our radars. Jazz, for instance, was not always a venerable art form. Elitist critics condemned jazz as a degenerate form of music, and jazz artists were limited to playing New Orleans brothels and Kansas City dance halls. But, through the efforts of critics in magazines such as Down Beat, jazz came to be recognized as a complex art form that could be appreciated intellectually. This paved the way for landmark jazz performances in the world’s most prestigious venues, from New York to Tokyo. Today, jazz is widely adored. These days, everybody is a self-appointed critic. From Yelp ratings to GoodReads reviews, the internet has created a glut of criticism. It’s often hard to hear the voices of true critics among the overwhelming noise of amateurs. This development has consequences for our culture. Name-calling, gut reactions and even rage are the order of the day for online reviewers. This is a far cry from the thoughtful, insightful critical writing that professional critics spend years honing. Despite this, review aggregators like Rotten Tomatoes give equal weight to traditional critics, bloggers and critics on new sites like Reelviews and The A.V. Club. Students at universities with outstanding curricula dedicated to the study and art of critique are now in direct competition with online comment boards. If they want their voices to be heard, professional critics must publish new writing at an incredible pace. Despite their lack of education in criticism, today’s bloggers are just as, if not more influential than established, educated critics. This has sparked a fiery debate among the critical community as to whether new forms of criticism should be embraced or not. Either way, the young upstarts on the critical scene look like they’re here to stay. Throughout the history of art and culture, the printed word has been at the center of critical debate about aesthetics. But today, print faces some serious challenges. The rise of the internet and the accompanying collapse of our attention span has changed print journalism irrevocably. Long-form printed criticism has been superseded by rapid social media commentary. By the time a printed film review is published and read, hundreds of tweets and online conversations have beaten it to the punch. Traditional media outlets from newspapers to magazines are struggling to survive. Forced to publish content online for free to match their social-media-savvy competitors, they’ve seen revenues fall to an all-time low. Staff and budgets have been cut, and many publications have faded away altogether. The age of the critic as the brilliant but controversial provocateur is fast disappearing. Today, the pressure is on to create catchy sound bites or clickbait headlines to provide websites with hits, likes and shares. It’s clear that traditional critics must move with the times. They have a lot to learn from writers who have embraced digital media. Many successful writers today got their start as bloggers and worked their way up to score roles at internet publishing giants such as BuzzFeed. Though these new media titans look very different to traditional publishers, at heart they possess the same journalistic spirit. As the digital revolution unfolds, they may breathe fresh life into the practice of criticism. The key message in this book: Criticism is something we all practice in many aspects of our lives, from the way we view art to our take on how a neighbor is dressed. It happens all the time, and we don’t even realize it. But true criticism has to be interesting in and of itself. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Or do you feel like you’re a plaything of fate, thrust about by circumstances you can’t control? If you feel unhappy and aimless, these blinks are for you. They outline a concept called the Greatest Principle, the assumption that everything that ails you stems from some internal problem – even if your current struggles are with external matters like physical or financial difficulties, or a nasty divorce. And that’s great news; in the end, it’s entirely up to you to control your internal state. These blinks explain how to obtain this control. You’ll learn how to ease any pain or fear by rebalancing the energy in your body, as well as how to set goals that can make you happier. By following this advice, you may well find yourself in a much better situation in as little as 40 days. You’ll also find out why a pay raise or breast enlargement won’t make you a happier person; how the pursuit of happiness differs a lot from a child’s quest for ice cream; and why a heart transplant can make you crave fast food.   What do you want more than anything else in the world? Take a moment and think it over until you land on that one thing you desire most. Given a chance to consider this question, it’s likely you came up with an answer. But is it the right one? Well, there’s an easy way to know if it’s the wrong answer, because goals founded on things like money, achievement or health – also known as external circumstances – are always the incorrect choice. Even so, 99 percent of the answers people give to this question are based on external circumstances. But what’s wrong with wanting to strike it rich, win an Olympic medal or get in perfect shape? Absolutely nothing! Except, deep down, none of that describes why you got out of bed this morning, or what’ll keep you motivated tomorrow. In other words, goals based on external circumstances don’t permeate everything you do. Instead, people choose such goals because they believe myths, like the notion that money will make them happy. However, while things like material wealth might bring you joy for a little while, being a millionaire is no guarantee of a happy, peaceful and loving life. That’s why strong goals for success are based on attaining a particular inward state, like feeling calm or full of love. A goal like this will become a part of everything you do and, when you get up in the morning, it will be because of your goal. In fact, although you might be unaware of it, this is a goal you’ve already set for yourself; it’s why you brush your teeth, why you eat, why you work and why you hang out with your friends. Simply put, it pervades every aspect of your life. So, if there’s a deeper goal already motivating you, why is it so hard to identify what you want most from life? To find out, you’ll need to travel back in time to your childhood. Imagine it’s a sweltering August day. You’re five years old and want an ice cream. How do you communicate your desire? More or less without fail, kids apply a three-step strategy and, if it doesn’t work, they use willpower to get what they want. The strategy unfolds like this: The child wants something, in this case, ice cream. The child makes a plan to get it, for instance by asking his mother. And finally, the child carries out the plan by going to his mom with his request. But, if the child doesn’t get what he wants, he changes the second step to utilize his willpower, persistently demanding ice cream until he gets it. When his mother denies him his treat, he might plead, negotiate and even offer to clean his room in exchange for what he wants. This blueprint is a result of our pain/pleasure programming, which implies that children only want ice cream in the first place because they innately seek pleasurable things and avoid painful ones. Because of his urge for pleasure, the child forms and carries out plans to get enjoyable things; the three-step blueprint is born. However, while this might work just fine for kids, applying this blueprint as adults prevents us from achieving true happiness. Say you’re a married woman who meets a drop-dead gorgeous man at a bar. You want nothing more than to have a one-night stand with him. The problem is, while you could come up with a plan to get him into bed, carry it out and get what you want, achieving your desire will only bring you fleeting pleasure and a whole lot of trouble afterward. Not only that, but if your default response is to chase after any potentially pleasurable experience, you’ll always find a new external goal to seek and will never experience the happiness that’s waiting within you. So, in this way, your inner child can prevent you from becoming truly happy. Next up, you’ll learn how painful experiences can also affect the path to your ultimate goal. Lots of people have stiff backs and experience chest pains, but would you ever have imagined that the source of such ailments lies in your cellular memory? It’s true. Your brain isn’t the only place that memories are stored; the cells throughout your body record experiences and, if they’re painful, the cells can become unhealthy. This was the conclusion reached in a 2004 study conducted at the Southwestern University Medical Center in Texas. In this experiment, as well as others, scientists found that experiences can indeed reprogram human cells by changing chemical markers, tags that are attached to genes and tell cells which genes to use. Furthermore, the researchers concluded that both physical illnesses like cancer and mental ones like depression can be the result of bad cellular memories. This discovery can even explain why lots of organ recipients show new personality traits immediately after receiving an organ from a donor. Cells seem to “remember” what we experience as pleasurable and retain this information when transferred to another body. For instance, in 1988, Claire Sylvia had a heart and lung transplant at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. Sylvia, a dancer and choreographer, had always been serious about having a nutritious diet – but suddenly all she wanted to eat was Kentucky Fried Chicken. She also began preferring the colors blue and green over colors with a reddish hue, which she had once adored. Following some investigation, Sylvia found out that her organ donor had shared all these desires. Her experience, as well as the comparable ones of dozens of other organ recipients, are a result of cellular memory. We now know that your cells don’t forget the painful parts of your past. But what can be done about it? In fact, there’s a simple tool to heal these wounds, and you’ll learn all about it in the next blink. Have you ever heard of energy medicine? It is, among other tools, a powerful way to overcome physical symptoms and emotional problems by applying energy to different parts of the body. Does it sound like quackery? Well, it’s not. Your body consists of energy and, if some of it goes bad, it needs to be replaced. If you don’t believe it, just look to Albert Einstein. In 1905, he discovered that everything in the universe is energy, including the cells in our bodies. When this energy is positive, the body is healthy. However, if you suffer from a positive energy deficit or bad energy enters the mix, you’ll suffer and be in pain. Thankfully, you can heal, or deprogram, yourself from such afflictions by infusing your body’s cells with positive energy using the Energy Medicine tool. First, you need to determine what’s bothering you. Maybe you’re anxious about a work presentation, feel depressed or have a persistent headache. Once you figure out what the issue is, relax, close your eyes and say a short prayer that expresses your desire to be rid of the problem or pain. For instance, you might say, “I wish that whatever is making me depressed will heal so I can be a better partner to my husband.” Next, take the heart position by placing your hands, stacked onto each other, on top of your heart. Once there, make small circular motions, changing directions every 10 to 15 seconds. Continue this process for one to three minutes. Once you’ve done that, take the forehead position by placing your hands, stacked in the same manner, just above your eyebrows. Again, make small circular motions for up to three minutes with a shift in direction every 10 to 15 seconds. Finally, take the crown position by placing your hands on top of your head and making the same circular motions. By repeating these three positions a couple of times a day, you should notice diminishing symptoms. At times, just living your life can feel like navigating a dense jungle. How can you tell if you’re on the right path to reaching your ultimate goal for success? First off, you need to know what your desire looks like; after all, to reach your ultimate goal, your desires need to be in line with it. Simply put, if your desire doesn’t match your goal, you’re on the wrong track. For instance, say your ultimate goal is internal peace. If one of your desires is to get a graduate degree, and doing so would make your life much more stressful, then pursuing it would prevent you from attaining your ultimate goal. In other words, success goals are never based on external circumstances. Rather, they’re always related to things you can achieve right at this moment. In fact, part of the definition of a success goal is that attaining it is entirely within your control. And, for you to take control over your goals, they need to have traits that desires don’t always have. Here’s how the two differ: While desires can be based on external forces, success goals must correspond to an inner state. After all, you’re never in total control of external circumstances and, consequently, ultimate success goals are an internal state, like living with love, truth or happiness. Another difference is that what you desire always lies in the future. For instance, you might want to go on a vacation to a secluded beach, but aren’t there yet. On the other hand, your ultimate success goal is something you can attain right now. In other words, while you have no control over whether you feel happy two years from now, it’s completely within your control to feel happy in this moment. So, let go of the external desires that you have no control over and begin attaining your goal right now, in the present. Imagine your desire is  to launch your own business, but you’ve got no clue how to do so. When you’re hit with this realization, negative thoughts might fill your head, leading you to believe that you don’t have enough time, will never be able to raise enough money and are too incompetent to make your dream a reality. You might even think that failure will make you look like an idiot, and be paralyzed by this possibility. So, how can you overcome these fears? Begin by writing them down and rating them from zero to ten, zero being the one you’re least worried about and ten the one you fear the most. So, if you’re really worried about money, you might give it a seven, while time, which you’re less concerned about, might get a three. By listing your fears in this way, you’ll notice the small changes that occur over time. Then, list your desires and assess how confident you are in your ability to achieve them. In this case, a zero corresponds to no measure of confidence whatsoever and a ten to absolute certainty. Now that you’ve got your fears and desires down on paper, you can tackle your worries while boosting your confidence. A great way to do so is with the Energy Medicine tool described earlier. Applying the Energy Medicine tool when negative thoughts occupy your mind will allow your unconscious to gradually reduce the worry, making it easily replaced by feelings of love and peace. To achieve this result, you might have to use the tool over and over – but if you persist, your worries will vanish. So be sure to stick with it until your negative thoughts are a thing of the past; that is, until you rate them as zeros on the ten-point scale. Similarly, you should apply the Energy Medicine tool, or another deprogramming tool, to thoughts about a specific desire until you rank your confidence in achieving it as seven or higher. Now that you’ve done the important and difficult work necessary to get rid of your negative thoughts and boost your positive ones, you’ll want to make sure all this effort isn’t undone. But how? By repeating the steps you just took, rating both your worries and positive beliefs, every day for 40 days. Seeing this period of internal focus through is key to preventing negative thoughts from coming back – or positive ones from diminishing. If, during this period, you find yourself worrying about a decline in positive thinking or an increase in negative thinking, take a step back and reactivate your deprogramming tools, like the Energy Medicine tool, until your ratings return to healthy levels. By maintaining this practice for 40 days you’ll likely find yourself worry-free and confident. And, if you don’t, don’t sweat it. It just means it’ll take a few more rounds. So, if you experience setbacks during your 40-day push, don’t think you need to restart. Instead, simply “freeze” time; that is, stop counting the days until your levels of worry and confidence come back in line. After the 40 days, or whenever it is that your confidence is restored, you’ll be able to wake up every morning not only worry-free, but with a powerful belief that you’ll reach your success goal. Once you’ve made it this far, negative thoughts will only creep back because of a failure to completely deprogram yourself. If this happens, just do another round of 40 days and keep repeating the process until your thoughts stay positive. It’s easy to make this commitment when you remember that you’re on a journey, the reward of which is nothing less than lifelong love, peace and joy! The key message in this book: Fulfilling desires external to yourself will never truly satisfy you, but attaining your ultimate success goal will. To do so, you need only focus on what’s really important: love, peace and happiness. Actionable advice: Uncover your ultimate success goal with a little help from a genie.  It’s easy to choose a goal that’s all wrong. After all, while becoming a millionaire sounds pretty good, most people know that external goals, like becoming super rich, won’t make them happy in the long run. To figure out your ultimate success goal, try this simple trick: Clear your mind and imagine a genie, like the one from the story of Aladdin, complete with his magic lamp and ready to fulfill your single greatest wish. The only catch is that you’ve got just ten seconds to decide what that wish is before he disappears forever. Forcing yourself to choose in just ten seconds will focus your mind on what’s most important to you right now. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Perhaps you’ve already tried, by studying while listening to classical music, or by keeping a diary of daily events to jog your memory. These blinks will help you better understand exactly how your brain works so you can find new and exciting ways to make it function better. These “brain rules” give you insight into how exercise makes our minds healthier and happier, how sleeping is important for more than just beauty, and how learning information with all our senses is the best way to absorb and retain things. All in all, the more you know, the smarter your brain will be! In these blinks, you’ll discover how an amputee could feel his missing limb by looking in a mirror; why one Russian journalist could recall random numbers 15 years later; and why you should probably hit the sack early tonight. Have you ever wondered what a day in the life of a Homo sapiens looked like? How our ancestors spent their time directly affected how our own brains have developed. Consider that the average Homo sapiens may have walked or ran from 10 to 20 kilometers per day. This means that our brains didn’t develop while we were lazing about, but as we exercised. Exercise allows your body to get more energy out of the food you eat. When you exercise, you increase blood flow to all your body’s tissues. And as your blood flow increases, your body also starts to produce new blood vessels, making it even easier for your blood to do its job, such as move vitamins and minerals around and get rid of waste. So when you move your body, not only do you feel better but you think more effectively, too! To better understand what’s happening in this process, think about a system of roads. In the early 1800s, an English engineer noticed that traders had a tough time moving supplies over uneven dirt roads. He developed a method to coat roads with layers of rock and gravel to make them more even and thus more reliable. The engineer’s idea quickly spread as people realized better roads meant better access to goods in general. You make the same improvements to your body when you exercise, as your blood vessels are essentially your body's roads. Exercise also makes your body’s tissues healthier by stimulating the production of certain hormones such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). One of the brain's most powerful growth hormones, BDNF keeps your neurons refreshed and healthy and increases the connections between neurons. It also stimulates the creation of new cells. So the more you exercise, the healthier and more robust your brain and body will be! From an evolutionary standpoint, sleeping is dangerous, as it makes us vulnerable to predators. If we’ve evolved to take such a serious risk on a daily basis, it stands to reason that sleep is important. But what exactly does sleeping do? Simply put, sleeping regenerates our mind and body. Your mind and body suffers when you don’t get enough sleep. And if you don't sleep enough during one week, for example, your “sleep debt” is  carried into the next. A study examined a group of soldiers responsible for operating complex military hardware. Researchers kept the soldiers awake for one night, then had them take a cognitive test the following day. A loss of just one night’s sleep resulted in a 30 percent loss in overall cognitive skills, while two sleepless nights led to a 60 percent decrease. Another study found that when a person got only six hours of sleep or less per night for five nights, that person’s cognitive performance was just as low as a person who was kept awake for 48 continuous hours. Every human has a natural preference for a particular sleep schedule that is unique to them, and research has shown that people who stay true to their natural cycles have in general stronger cognitive abilities.   When it comes to sleeping patterns, there are three types: larks, owls and hummingbirds. Larks wake up often before 6 a.m. and are the most alert before noon. Some 10 percent of the population are classified as larks. In contrast, owls rarely hit the sack before 3 a.m., being most alert around 6 p.m. Owls too make up about 10 percent of the population. The rest of us are hummingbirds, fluctuating between the other two types. Sometimes we stay up late; sometimes we wake up before the sun rises. So take care of yourself and get enough sleep! It helps your brain function better. You probably have heard of the “fight or flight” response. We experience this in reaction to a stressful situation, and ideally this response helps us stay away from danger. Thus stress motivates us to protect ourselves; it can even save our lives. Yet chronic stress is harmful. When people become accustomed to feeling stressed, they often lose their sense of control. They feel helpless when faced with problems. The brains of stressed-out people stop learning, too. Psychologist Martin Seligman illustrated this sort of reaction in the late 1960s through a series of tests that resulted in the identification of a condition we now know as learned helplessness. Seligman’s subjects were various groups of dogs, which were given a daily electrical shock. Dogs that received regular shocks initially howled and tried to fight. As the shocks continued over time, however, a dog’s willingness to fight was reduced. In a next step, Seligman put a dog in a box from which it could escape the shocks if it wanted to. Yet the dog didn’t, instead cowering in a corner and whimpering. It assumed the shocks were inevitable, and thus made no attempt to escape. Suffering from this kind of chronic stress harms every kind of cognitive ability. Chronically stressed people can't do math or process language efficiently, and have problems concentrating. Adults suffering from chronic stress also struggle with memory, performing some 50 percent lower on memory tests. They also have poorer executive functioning, the thinking involved in problem-solving and self-control. So while a little stress can help you take action, too much stress is detrimental to your overall health. As you're reading these blinks, millions of sensory neurons are firing simultaneously in your brain. Each is trying to grab your attention, but only a few break through to your consciousness. You won't actually notice the rest. Can you feel where your feet are right now? You probably didn’t until you read that sentence. Thinking about your feet before that wasn’t a detail that was important for your brain. Your brain has to determine exactly to what it pays attention, and emotions help it do this. We have a number of cognitive systems that help us perceive threats, opportunities and patterns. Our brains needed such functions to survive and evolve. If our ancestors couldn't stay away from predators or find a mate, they wouldn't have successfully passed on their genes. That's why our brains select meaningful information that then is processed further, leaving the rest of the details alone. If your brain wasn't so selective, you'd be simply overwhelmed and possibly unable to function at all. Here’s an example. Try to remember the following words: raincoat, sandals, sunglasses, umbrella, swimsuit and boots. Now try to remember the same words when you divide them into structured groups. Beach gear: sunglasses, swimsuit and sandals. Rain gear: umbrella, raincoat and boots. Research has shown that when we group words like this, we remember them 40 percent better. In other words, your brain processes information better if the information it is fed is meaningful. Direct your brain toward important things, otherwise you’ll find yourself distracted by other non-essential details. Keep this in mind when you present information to others. If you want your audience to pay attention to a presentation, for example, keep it under 10 minutes, as otherwise the abundance of information will overload the minds of your audience! Michael Jordan, one of the top basketball players in history, quit basketball in 1994 and took up baseball. Surprisingly, he failed miserably. You might think that someone as athletic as Jordan could dominate in any sport, but baseball proved too challenging. So he went back to what his brain and muscles were used to, that is basketball. Our experiences don’t just change our brains, but literally rewire them. A team of neurosurgeons illustrated this in a test in which they showed a man different pictures while mapping which neurons fired in response to certain images. When the man looked a picture of Jennifer Aniston, the team noticed that a certain neuron fired in his brain. That same neuron fired when stimulated by seven other pictures of Aniston, but remained dormant for the 80 other pictures the man was shown. Now, we haven't evolved to have a neuron that lights up when Jennifer Aniston is spotted. Instead, our brains are so sensitive to external inputs that they physically rewire themselves to adapt. The research subject wasn’t a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, either. His brain had just adapted to the information he'd processed at one time or another about her. Our brains develop as we learn, and they develop at different rates, too. Interestingly, the human brain is only partially constructed at birth. Its biggest development projects continue on into our early 20s, with subtle changes extending well into our 40s. Consider this: About 10 percent of people don't have brains that are sufficiently wired for reading at the age of six. The variation in the brains of children is actually quite great. So why do schools expect every child to learn in the same fashion and at the same time? So we’ve learned that you're much more likely to be successful in your area of acquired expertise. That's why Michael Jordan wasn't good at baseball, as his brain wasn't wired for it.  Solomon Shereshevskii was a Russian journalist born in 1886, who was once given a formula of 30 letters and numbers and could still recall the formula some 15 years later. Shereshevskii's mighty memory came at a price. He could memorize random information, but he couldn't organize that information into meaningful patterns. He could understand all the words in a book individually, but he couldn't figure out what they meant when put together. Unlike with Shereshevskii, information needs to be meaningful for our brains to remember it. If you have to memorize a piece of information, make it more meaningful by repeating the information to yourself at spaced intervals. This means you would repeat it every 10 minutes over the course of two hours, as just one example. Nineteenth-century German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered that students usually forget 90 percent of what they learn in a class within 30 days. However, he proved that students could remember information more efficiently when they repeated it over and over at regular times. Spaced intervals make your brain realize that the information you’re repeating and it's processing is important. It must be meaningful, your brain thinks, or you wouldn't be recalling it so often. And when your brain attaches meaning to something, it remembers it better. There's another important challenge of learning, in that when you absorb new information, it might actually replace information you've already stored. Evidence suggests that when we think about our long-term memories, they enter our short-term memory again. Which means that these memories can essentially be replaced by other information we’d like to store in long-term memory. This is part of the reason that studying a foreign language is often challenging. When you memorize a certain word, for example, a word that is spelled similarly that you have in long-term memory might easily get replaced by that word from your short-term memory. So if you’re a teacher, don’t just teach your students a new thing and then move on. Your students need to be reminded of that new material every few weeks to truly learn it. Can you listen to music while you study? If you can, it’s probably because your brain has evolved to be able to do so! Again, think about the lives of our ancestors. Our Homo sapiens forefathers didn’t spend their days quietly painting in caves without distraction. Instead, their brains had to handle multiple stimuli at once, whether visual, aural, olfactory or tactile. Our brains have powerful integrative instincts, meaning they are able to take in information through multiple senses at once. In fact, when multiple senses are stimulated at the same time, their capabilities increase. A particular study had participants watching a video of a person speaking, yet without sound. Interestingly, the areas of the participants' brains responsible for sound processing were stimulated, just as if they were hearing the person in the video speak. Yet when shown a video of a person just making faces without sound, the participants’ auditory cortex was inactive. In other words, visual stimuli can activate the parts of our brains that typically handle sound. Our senses are connected; they stimulate each other. We don't learn as well in unisensory situations, in which only one sense is used. Cognitive psychologist Richard Mayer discovered this when examining the link between learning and multimedia exposure. In his experiment, Mayer passed on some information to people separated into three groups. The first group only heard the information; the second only saw it; and the third group both heard and saw the information. The study showed that the third group was much better at recalling the information they'd learned. The benefits of multisensory experiences might seem counterintuitive. Wouldn’t a brain get overloaded with too much competing information? Yet our brains don't work that way. Research has shown that they prefer heavy lifting! So expose yourself to multisensory learning tools. Don't feel bad about watching YouTube videos about economics or physics instead of reading your textbook, as the visuals can help you learn, too! Vision is a powerful sense, one that can trick our other senses into interpreting stimuli differently. A group of researchers learned this by pulling the wool over some wine experts’ eyes! The researchers wanted to see whether wine tasters could tell the difference between red wines and white wines that had been dyed red. It turns out they couldn’t; when the tasters drank the dyed whites, they thought they were red wines. Vision trumped smell! In another experiment, participants were shown 2,500 images for about 10 seconds each. Several days later, participants could recall the images with an impressive 90 percent accuracy. After a year, accuracy rates were still high, around 63 percent. Yet when people listen to information, they only recall about 10 percent of it after a period of three days. Yet if an image accompanies spoken information, people will remember 65 percent of the information after the same period. This is called the pictorial superiority effect, an effect that scientists identified more than 100 years ago. The pictorial superiority effect says that our visual sense has a much stronger influence on our perception than any other sense. To prove that vision is more powerful than touch, researchers have examined the visual and haptic (touch) senses of amputees. In one study, an amputee sat in front of a mirror placed on a table in a fashion that when the subject moved in a particular way, the reflection made it look as if he had regained his amputated arm. When the subject saw the reflection, his visual senses overpowered his haptic senses. He suddenly felt a phantom left arm, just like he saw the “left” arm in the mirror. The key message in this book: The human brain is a sophisticated information-transfer system. Optimize your mind by understanding better how it works. Exercise, get enough sleep and avoid chronic stress. Take advantage of multisensory learning and the pictorial superiority effect. In doing so, you’ll maximize your intellectual potential. Actionable advice: Deliver information in a meaningful way so people remember. If you're giving a lecture, keep it short so people aren’t overloaded. Also, give them the opportunity to take in the information with more than one sense: don't just talk, but add visuals or sound to your presentation.

Whether it’s always having to put on a friendly face to everyone you meet or not being too critical of others for fear of being considered bitchy, navigating the world as a woman is often an incredibly difficult task. While boys are taught from a young age to explore and take risks, women are conditioned to please those around them. This means that girls grow up to be women that are often afraid to fail. But failing is a necessary part of life and a source of valuable life lessons. This is what the author learned after her epic failure while running for Congress. Instead of letting it get her down, though, she bounced back with a new, brave idea – rather than serving the public via holding office, she founded Girls Who Code. Sure, she made a lot of mistakes along the way, but by marching on, bravery in hand, her organization has now reached tens of thousands of girls and women all over the country, and equipped them with the knowledge that they themselves can use to get ahead. In these blinks, you’ll learn why being a perfectionist won’t necessarily help you get promoted; what daily bravery challenges are and why you should do them; and how the #MeToo movement has inspired millions of women to embrace bravery. Meet Erica. She’s a middle-aged, successful woman who is always extremely friendly, helpful and greets everyone with a dazzling smile. Working from dawn until dusk to impress clients and colleagues doesn’t stop her from constantly looking fresh and ready to go.  Indeed, no matter the situation, Erica is always projecting perfectionism onto the world around her and trying to please everyone she comes across. But deep down, Erica wishes she could act differently. In fact, sometimes, she wishes she was brave enough to tell her biggest client that she thinks his business strategies are terrible. Sadly, the inherent drive that so many women feel to please everyone around them and strive towards perfection keeps her locked in a life that she doesn’t want to live. Erica is a good friend of the author. And, like the author, she’s a victim of a society where women are taught to be afraid of risk, of being bold and choosing the lives they want to lead – independently of what others think. Instead of being brave, young girls are taught how to be perfect for the sake of pleasing those around them. The opposite is true of young boys, who are encouraged to explore, fail and take risks. The categorization of girls as agreeable people-pleasers starts as soon as they’re born. One study that placed babies without recognizable genders in neutral clothes showed that when they were upset, adults were more likely to think they were boys. But when they were happy, most adults assumed the infants were girls. And this expectation of girls quickly develops into reality.  Consider a University of California study involving a simple lemonade stand. The catch? Instead of adding sugar, the researchers added salt, making the beverage less than satisfying. After handing them out to groups of boys and girls, the results of the social conditioning girls go through became clear: boys immediately conveyed how disgusting it tasted, whereas girls politely sipped it. Only after the researchers pressed the girls on why they kept drinking did the truth come out – the girls said they didn’t want the researchers to feel bad. This is the society we live in – where boys are bred to be brave, and girls to please via an endless drive toward perfection. Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck once famously said that “if life were one long grade school, girls would rule the world.” Getting straight A’s in school isn’t a bad thing, but the drive for perfection it results from doesn’t translate well into adult life. The truth is that while being courteous and pleasant might make you a popular conversation partner around the water cooler, it won’t help you when you require the bravery to deal with sexual harassment in the office. And while having a perfect body might help you get hot dates, it won’t give you the courage to fall in love and get your heart broken. The author’s own life story reflects how bravery is a much more important trait than perfection. She was a straight-A student at school and went on to become a lawyer at a prestigious corporate law firm. But she hated her job – her dream had always been to get involved in public service.  When the 2008 Democratic nomination was announced, the author was distraught after finding out that her idol, Hillary Clinton, whom she’d extensively campaigned for, had lost to Barack Obama. But Clinton’s concession speech helped the author realize that she needed to stop striving for perfection. One failure, Clinton proclaimed, doesn’t mean we should give up on our dreams. So, the author quit her corporate job and made a radical decision – she would run for Congress. While she failed miserably at doing so, the experience uncovered some myths of perfection that she herself had fallen for. One of these is that being impeccable on the outside will guarantee a perfect ending to every story. By masking her insecurities and flaws with pristine hair and a faultless stump speech, the author was convinced she’d be spared criticism from her opponents during her run for Congress. She quickly learned how wrong she was. Perfection wasn’t what she needed – bravery in the face of criticism was much more important. That isn’t to say that the pressure to appear perfect isn’t imaginary. As Clinton herself had remarked in 2008, while Obama could simply “roll out of bed and into a suit,” she had to spend hours getting her hair and make-up done for any public appearance. How we present ourselves does matter – but it isn’t everything. And clinging onto the veneer of perfection instead of presenting a brave face won’t help us get through the difficult situations that all women will eventually face in life. In 2016, the author gave a TED talk on the need for women to be brave. Unsurprisingly, while her talk received widespread praise, it was not without its detractors. Male keyboard warriors took to the comments section of her talk to mansplain that bravery is an essentially male trait thanks to evolution. Women, some of these misguided men explained, were simply not biologically fit to be brave and take risks. Such fallacious arguments are not new. But the Tarzan/Jane view of men being the fearless providers who risk their lives to go out into the wild to hunt, while pregnant women stay in the safety of the cave, is quite an outdated argument. Society has changed a lot since then, to say the least. And the role of women in society has changed as well. Consider Sharon, a friend of the author, who ended a 25-year marriage and comfortable life as a housewife to come out of the closet and declare that she was a lesbian. Or Audrey, the babysitter the author hires to look after her son, who made it through breast cancer and is now cancer-free.  Or what about all the women who raise their voices to speak out against sexism in the workplace, even if it endangers their job? Don’t these brave actions defy a supposed “evolutionary” argument that men are the braver of the sexes? The author herself had her bravery tested to its limits in 2017 when taking an unpopular position against what she saw as extreme injustice. After being invited to an event celebrating the Trump administration’s 200 million dollar commitment to computer science education, the author decided against attending. All the big names in tech were going to be there, but she publicly refused the invitation in the form of a New York Times op-ed. Why? She felt she had to take a stand against the bigotry exemplified by Trump’s recent banning of refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations. The author expected a huge backlash as a result of her decision to go against the flow. But instead of receiving hate mail, her organization Girls Who Code saw a huge uptick in small donations from all over the nation. While everyone has bad habits they want to change, we all know that it’s often easier said than done. Nevertheless, change is possible if we put our minds to it.  This is particularly so when it comes to escaping the vicious cycle of constantly striving for unattainable perfection – and replacing it with the habit of being brave. Luckily, there are a number of strategies that can help women develop a bravery mindset. And while attaining it doesn’t happen overnight, it’s not as difficult as you might think. The first and most important step in adopting the bravery mindset is to always keep your tank full. Many women that the author knows are perpetually exhausted from juggling the roles of employee, parent, housewife and chief household organizer. On top of all of that, they’re always putting the needs of others first and striving for perfection. Essentially, modern womanhood is a recipe for burnout. Of course, it’s extremely difficult to be brave when you’re always on the verge of exhaustion. Being brave demands stamina, energy and endurance, hence the importance that women stay healthy – both mentally and physically.  Make sure to get enough sleep, set aside time every day for meditation and keep up a regular routine at the gym. By always keeping your tank full, you’ll be ready to start putting the bravery mindset into practice. One way to do so is to set daily bravery challenges. For example, if you’ve always been afraid of speaking up at a meeting unless you’re absolutely sure that it’s an extremely astute observation, throw that out the window. Tell yourself that today, you’re going to speak up at the meeting even if your idea might fall on deaf ears.  The more bravery you practice, the easier it gets. Another challenge you could set yourself is to regularly ask for feedback from your peers. For women obsessed with perfection, receiving criticism can be the last thing they want to hear. But if we’re going to improve ourselves, then it’s time to move outside the comfort zone.  Instead of waiting for feedback, bravely invite it. Ask your colleagues about what you could be doing better. Over time, you’ll enter a state of “flow” where you’ll stay on the lookout for feedback in everything that you do, which will allow you to begin journeying down a road of constant self-improvement. In 2017, Shalane Flanagan became the first American woman to win the New York City Marathon in 40 years. But she didn’t just set a new record – the “Shalane Flanagan effect” inspired other female athletes to come together and support one another. Together, she and her team are now ranked amongst the world’s top long-distance runners.  Flanagan and women like her are playing for Team Brave. When women band together, they can achieve great things, and inspire each other to be brave in what the author calls sisterhoods of strength. This is especially important in the current age of “bitch culture,” where women are often more vicious than ever with behind-the-scenes gossiping, snide comments and manipulating.  So instead of killing the sisterhood with a thousand cuts, get out there and support your fellow women. This doesn’t have to be by winning a marathon – the sisterhood is strengthened by something as simple as speaking up when you hear a sexist comment directed toward another woman. Now that you’ve committed to your daily bravery challenges and have joined the sisterhood of strength, it’s time for some bad news.  Being brave entails higher risks, and with risk comes the possibility of failure. So it’s important to know how to deal with failure, whether it’s losing an election like the author did, or bombing a job interview. The first thing to do after any failure is to let it all out – spend a few days despairing, binge-watching series and eating Ben & Jerry’s. But three days maximum, ladies, because the next step after despairing is to celebrate your failure. If you’ve failed at something, it means you at least had the bravery to try. And you need to celebrate that bravery, even if trying didn’t lead to success. Finally, it’s time to review, reassess and realign. Figure out where you went wrong. What happened, exactly? What could you have done better? What are the consequences of your failure? Once you’ve reviewed the situation, reassess it from an external perspective. Try to step out of your own head and look at the situation through someone else’s eyes. You might see things differently. The last step is to realign. Remember what drove you towards your failure in the first place. For the author, she wanted to make a difference by running for public office. When that failed, she chose another way to make a difference and launched Girls Who Code. The key message in these blinks: From an early age, girls are groomed to become people-pleasers and perfectionists. This is in stark contrast to their male peers, who are encouraged to make mistakes and get their hands dirty. These socially conditioned personality traits continue into adulthood, causing countless women to be held back in their personal and professional lives. By throwing out perfectionism and embracing the bravery mindset, however, women can protect themselves from burnout, achieve their dreams and band together so that women everywhere can prosper.

What to read next: The Moment of Lift, by Melinda Gates. Now that you’ve hopefully been inspired by Saujani’s bravery manifesto, it’s time to take a look at another titan of female empowerment. Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has done an incredible amount of work all around the world to help lift women out of poverty. Whether via providing access to contraceptives in the developing world or educating communities on how both men and women benefit from feminism, her foundation has done a whole lot when it comes to female empowerment. Luckily, Gates has just released a memoir detailing the work her foundation does with women all over the world. So head on over to our blinks for The Moment of Lift to discover what sort of work Gates’s foundation is doing to help women all over the world prosper.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Information, in the form of news or entertainment, could suddenly be “broadcast” or sent out into the world, for anyone with a receiver to pick up and listen to.   Yet it’s not just radio programs or TV series that are regularly broadcasted – people broadcast their own messages every day. A manager broadcasts her ideas to a department; a teacher broadcasts knowledge to his students.  In these blinks, we’ll take a closer look at how we can use this idea of broadcasting to promote positive change in our communities and a happier mind-set in ourselves. We’ll learn how to use communications strategies to encourage well-being and success in others as well as in ourselves, by being our own personal broadcasting station and broadcasting happiness! In these blinks, you’ll learn how CBS reporting on the 2008 crisis actually make viewers happier; how reminiscing about times past helped seniors improve their eyesight; and  which four words help you deliver bad news in a good way.  When you see the word “job,” what is the first thing you think of? Whether a funny memory from your very first position or an unpleasant event from a recent job, each person has flash memories that can shape the way you think about a particular subject or theme.  Words trigger different flash memories in different people. The word “success” might make one individual reflect on a ceremony where he won an award, while another person might think of the moment she finally finished a huge project.  These thoughts aren’t simply memories, but a reflection of each individual's attitude toward success.  In this fashion, positive flash memories can actually create positive attitudes. But how do we create positive flash memories? Simple: by creating positive experiences!  That’s exactly what Sunnyside High School superintendent Dr. Richard Cole decided to do. His school was notorious for its poor graduation rate, which by 2007 had fallen to 41 percent.  Cole knew that both students and teachers wallowed in a culture of low expectations. To combat this, he worked to give everyone at the school an attitude makeover.  How did he do this? By sharing success stories wherever and whenever he could. Bulletin boards, newsletters and school announcements were filled with good news from the student body. This step was the beginning of a seven-year shift toward creating a positive learning environment.  By 2014, the school’s graduation rate had shot up to 89 percent. After leaving school, students no longer described their time at the school as miserable, but remembered classes and teachers fondly.  In other words, the student body developed positive flash memories that would serve each of them well as they moved on to college or a career.  Humans have been telling stories to each other from our very early days – the detailed narratives drawn in ancient caves prove this. Today, mass media is our “cave,” telling modern human stories.  Of course, if you’ve ever watched the news, most stories sure don’t leave you feeling upbeat or happy.  While negative storytelling can bring you down, positive storytelling can energize you – even improve your health. But wait – doesn’t that sound too good to be true? It isn’t. in 1979, Harvard professor Dr. Ellen Langer put the power of positive storytelling to the test in an experiment called, “Welcome to the year 1959!”  She invited a group of 75-year-old males to attend a weeklong retreat. Yet at the retreat, the men had to pretend it was 1959 – when they were just 55 years old. During the week, the group could only share stories about the work, pastimes, relationships and experiences they’d had up to the age of 55. Participants were also required to complete intelligence, memory and strength tests before and after the retreat.  The results after the retreat were surprising. All the participants’ scores improved significantly after a week of sharing stories. Even the men's eyesight improved by some 10 percent!  Wouldn’t it be great if news broadcasters could also give us a dose of positive storytelling? Or with all the violence in the world, is that even possible? As a news anchor for CBS during the 2008 financial crisis, the author witnessed how the station lost half its viewers as a relentless stream of bad news drove people away. She wanted to inform the public about current events in a way that was optimistic but not dishonest; she didn’t want to artificially sugarcoat the news, just to make it palatable. In collaboration with positive psychology expert Dr. Martin Seligman, the author pioneered CBS’s Happy Week, a program that offered positive, solution-oriented perspectives on even the worst of the world’s news.  CBS received more positive emails from viewers after this week of programming than it did in the entire previous year! Do you share good news freely? Too often we keep positive thoughts or events to ourselves. But why do we do this?  There are a couple of reasons. Perhaps we aren’t sure that people really care about the great weekend we had, or we don’t want to bother a friend who may have a lot on her mind.  But keeping mum about good things prevents us from tapping into the true potential of positivity. The truth is, simply being optimistic isn’t enough. You’ve got to broadcast your happiness to others. When you do, it will boost their optimism, too – and this is a powerful thing.  Just think of how great a work shift can be when all your coworkers are sharing the same bubbly, energetic mood. The workplace in particular is a space where broadcasting happiness is a vital tool.  Yet companies rarely realize this. In cooperation with Training magazine, the author performed a cross-industry study which revealed that 31 percent of employees felt they held in general a positive attitude but didn’t share their positive thoughts with coworkers.  Think about it: if employees started sharing their positivity, these workplaces would be transformed!  Of course, there are employees who do broadcast their emotions, yet they’re just more likely to share negative experiences. A University of California study revealed that people who openly express emotions frequently are also those who hold pessimistic views about life and work.  To keep the cranks from bringing your group, organization or team down, you’ve got to shake out and bolster your shy optimists and turn them into broadcasters. By carrying out surveys or even taking part in casual conversations, you can uncover those positive broadcasters, and encourage them to let their positive voices be heard – and watch everyone’s spirits lift!  Collaboration can be quite challenging. Each person on a team approaches work differently, which can often come to a head during collective tasks. Some team members might be super-motivated, while others have different priorities. Some are organized, while others are sloppy.  By priming your team to cooperate better, you can make the best of your team’s strengths and weaknesses.  This is where the power of positive words comes into play. Researchers at Stanford University uncovered the possibilities of priming with a “language test,” that wasn’t really a language test at all.  Half of the participants before they were handed the test were shown words with negative connotations, such as “rude” or “impatient.” The other half were shown words with more positive associations, such as “respectful” and “calm.”  The first group turned out to be just as unpleasant as the words primed them to be. These people interrupted the researcher 50 percent more often during the test, for example; while the second group behaved cordially and rarely interrupted – primed by the words they were shown. Another study furthers the power that positive priming can have on individuals.  Participants were asked to complete a test on general knowledge. One group was allowed to contemplate the characteristics of a stereotypical “intelligent professor” before the test, while another group considered a “hooligan.” Interestingly, those who were primed by the professor scored highly on the quiz, while those primed by the hooligan scored lower. Bad things can happen to anyone, at any time and anywhere. And the best thing to do when something bad does happen is to talk about it.  Remember, this doesn’t mean you’re broadcasting negativity! There are ways to share problems with others in ways that make the situation better, not worse.  Stick to the four Cs: social capital, context, compassion and commitment.  Social capital describes the physical ways we connect with people we talk to. Body language and eye contact help to make both parties feel they’re being listened to and understood.  Context means speaking about the real situation concretely and honestly, rather than hiding behind abstracts. This encourages you to tell the full story behind your dilemma, while the other person will be better able to grasp the challenges you’re facing.  Compassion is one of the most important Cs. Before sharing your opinion on a situation, ask yourself: Did I really listen to my friend? If you don’t understand why a person’s problem is such a big deal, try asking them more questions to help you imagine what it would be like to be in their shoes.  Finally, commitment is vital in communication. By showing how willing you are to help someone, you’ll create a genuine connection, rather than just exchanging platitudes and canned advice.  Keep the four Cs in mind the next time you’ve got bad news to share or are listening to a friend who does. This will keep both of you in an optimistic, solution-oriented mind-set.  But what happens if someone’s negativity is just too much? If it's clear that more talking won’t help, then feel free to make a strategic retreat. When away from the negative person, take time to reflect on the problem and identify points to bring up next time.  If you have the chance to discuss the dilemma with the person again, bring another positive-minded person with you. This will shift the balance in the discussion toward optimism, creating a better environment for listening and sharing advice. The key message in this book: Harness the power of flash memories to shape your attitude toward workplace challenges. By creating a positive perspective and sharing it with others, you can make a huge difference not only in your working environment but also in your personal relationships. Actionable advice: Tap into your flash memories! Say you want to succeed in business. Write down the word “business” and then note which flash memories come up when you think about that word. Perhaps your flash memories are “hard work,” “taxes,” “cooperation” and so on. Working with flash memories can lead you to formulating more precise life goals, as well as revealing any subconscious assumptions, strengths and weaknesses on a certain topic.

Maybe you attend a heavy metal concert, strike up a conversation with a fellow fan, discover he’s an entrepreneur and, months later, find yourself working for his start-up. Or perhaps you feel exceedingly lucky to have sat next to Todd in lectures because he’s turned out to be the man of your dreams. But, in reality, a lot of these apparently lucky outcomes have totally predictable causes. For instance, sociability is a predictor of opportunity (you wouldn’t have landed that job had you been too shy to talk). Similarly, proximity is a predictor of acquaintanceship (you fell for Todd because you met him, not because he was the dreamiest guy in the lecture hall). You can’t control everything in life. But luck is often more predictable than you might think, and we can all adapt our behavior, prepare for randomness and nudge the system so it works in our favor. So let’s dive in and find out why lucky people are lucky, and how you can learn to be lucky yourself. In these blinks, you’ll learn how looking the part and making a good first impression will increase your luck; why figure skaters who perform last are more likely to win; and how to overcome your natural inhibition and be more confident and curious. You’ve doubtless heard someone account for a serendipitous event – be it a job opportunity, a promotion or a romantic encounter – by saying, “I was just in the right place at the right time.” Well, it turns out there is a lot of truth to this cliché. At the very least, the “right time” part is crucial. Counterintuitive as it might seem, luck often depends on coming last. In any situation where a number of people, objects or performances are judged against each other, being among the last to be judged increases your chances of success. For example, an analysis of European figure-skating championships between 1994 and 2004 found that the first skater to perform had a 3 percent chance of winning, whereas the final performer had a 14 percent chance. The same pattern has been found in everything from synchronized-swimming championships to the Eurovision Song Contest. Why is this? Well, the human brain is wired to work this way. It relies on context, on the information and emotions that are currently available to it. Just consider house hunting. The first properties you view will be judged against your ideals because your mind isn’t yet stocked with real-life examples of real estate to compare them to. But, over time, as you see more properties, your brain will receive information about what is actually out there. You’ll start to think, “Well, this house seems pretty good compared to the first nine I looked at.” House hunters viewing their first property never say, “This house is perfect! We’ll take it!” They wait until they’ve seen a number of houses before settling on one they like. In the same way, figure-skating judges are reluctant to award an early competitor a 5.9 or a 6 (the highest marks available) because this will make it impossible to give later competitors a higher mark. By the end, competitors are more likely to pick up those high marks, however, since the judges know there is no one else coming who could trump them. So going last is lucky. If you can choose a job interview slot, go last. Want to pick up that hot guy at the bar? Make your attempt late in the evening. A social psychologist named Robert Zajonc once ran an experiment in which he exposed Westerners to foreign characters – Chinese logograms, for example – and then asked them how much they liked each character. Overall, the participants favored those characters that they had seen most frequently. This experiment is a demonstration of the exposure effect, which predicts that people will like things they’re familiar with. This effect has an obvious evolutionary explanation. As Zajonc put it, “If it’s familiar, it hasn’t eaten you yet.” So we tend to like what we know, and, in general, we’re most familiar with whatever we regularly get physically close to. For instance, one classic study shows that the physical proximity of two police recruits during training classes is positively correlated with the likelihood of their later becoming friends. Another study reveals that school children sitting in the center of a classroom make more friends than those on the edges because their central location makes it easier for other students to talk to them. So if making connections doesn’t come easily to you, don’t linger on the edges of that party or networking event. Get into the thick of it! But merely being around other people isn’t sufficient to spark friendships or profitable business connections. You also need to look the part. That’s because people instinctively use first impressions as a guide to decision-making. A study once examined whether musicians’ appearances affected how they were assessed. Judges were shown a series of videotaped violin performances, each by a female artist. Some of the violinists wore short skirts and tight tops, while others wore formal concert dress. The trick was that each performance was dubbed with the same musical recording. Nonetheless, judges consistently rated those in formal concert dress to be more technically proficient. Other studies show that doctors can increase their trustworthiness ratings simply by putting on a white coat over their suit. We can’t help but use our gut feelings to guide our decision-making. Thanks to years of observation, we simply feel that doctors wearing white coats can be trusted and that violinists in formal concert dress are the real deal. More often than not, our estimation of a person’s trustworthiness is based on a lightning-fast mental assessment – a first impression. So, whether with your Linkedin profile, your clothes or the strength of your handshake, try to make that first impression a good one. It really does matter. Most of us can think of people we know who are beautiful and seem to find success with ease. We all have that good-looking friend who was the college quarterback, always got the girls and is now raking in millions at Goldman Sachs. Beautiful people simply seem to have all the luck. And, in truth, beautiful people do have a lot of luck because humans are predisposed to favor attractive people. Since we can’t directly assess the quality of someone’s genes, we tend to make guesses based on the information that is available. An attractive, symmetrical face and nice, shiny hair are indicative of solid genes, so we tend to prefer people who possess such qualities. Our brains seamlessly make a series of logical leaps – from “this person is beautiful” to “this person must have good genes” to “this person is likely to be smart and well-adjusted.” If you’re of the opinion that beauty is a cultural construction, consider this. According to multiple studies, people of different genders, cultures and races tend to agree on who's hot and who's not. What’s more, babies do, too. When shown two faces – one that’s stereotypically beautiful and one that’s stereotypically ugly – six-month-olds spend more time looking at the attractive face. So attractive people tend to be favored by others, which really does make them luckier. This starts at an early age. One study found that parents with attractive babies – as judged by other people – are found to be more nurturing toward their children than the parents of less genetically-blessed offspring. The beautiful get extra help throughout life. In one study, researchers left university applications in phone booths, as if they had been left there by accident. Some of the applications, which included photos and addresses, were from attractive applicants, while others were from plainer candidates. Significantly more applications were mailed back to the attractive students than to their plain counterparts.   So how can those of us who aren’t physically stunning improve our luck? Well, we have control over our clothes, how much time we spend at the gym and whether we use makeup, of course. However, getting too worked up about your appearance can cause poor self-esteem. And as we’ll see in the next blink, confidence is also important when it comes to luck. If you have the confidence to get up and talk to that cute guy across the bar, you’ll be more likely to get lucky than if you sit in the corner, nursing your mojito. Confidence is about focusing more on reward than risk. Now, our brain has both an activation system, which encourages us to do things based on potential reward, and an inhibition system, which uses stress and anxiety to stop us from doing things based on potential risk. When we shift from activation to inhibition, we go from “go and talk to him – you might get a date out of it!” to “you’ll only embarrass yourself – it’s time to accept that you’ll die alone.”   People who are able to push activation over inhibition are luckier because they are more likely to get into the situations – talking to potential partners, demanding a promotion – that create opportunities for luck. However, for many people, this switch is easier said than done. The world is full of hierarchies, and there is plenty of evidence that people’s behavior conforms to their perceived place in the hierarchy. Consider why the rich guy from a successful family tends to be outspoken and confident. Research shows that, in the first four years of life, a child born into a professionally successful family receives 560,000 more pieces of encouraging feedback than discouraging feedback. In contrast, a working-class child receives just 100,000 more. And if a baby is born into a family on welfare, it’ll receive 125,000 more discouragements than encouragements. Low standing in the social hierarchy can mean low confidence and, therefore, less luck. But it’s possible to escape this trap. Girls are often told that they are less good at math than boys, and studies of women often find worse math results than for men. In one study, however, women about to take a math test were told to imagine themselves as “a stereotypical male.” This caused discrepancies in male and female performance to almost disappear completely. The women’s newfound confidence resulted in an obvious increase in mathematical ability.    If you’re naturally confident, lucky you! If not, here’s a trick that can help. Students who wrote for 15 minutes about one of their strengths – independence, say, or creativity – went on to perform better, over the course of a year, than a control group. Take time to remind yourself of your strengths. You got this! A Swedish psychologist named Karl Anders Ericsson once found that the world’s best musicians had, on average, practiced for 10,000 hours. This has led to a rather simplistic idea that’s been popularized by the writer Malcolm Gladwell – that you can become an expert in any field by practicing for 10,000 hours or more. It’s a seductive theory. You, too, could have been a world-class performer, if you’d only stuck with those oboe lessons instead of drinking Pinot Grigio with your friends! But it’s not really true. Hard work and practice aren’t enough. You also need the right genes. Researchers exploring the link between genes and athletic performance have found that genes can account for anywhere between 31 and 85 percent of variation between athletes. So the difference between an Olympic medalist and an “also ran” doesn’t depend on practice alone; it’s also genetic. You need the right resources, too, not to mention the right location. It’s entirely possible that someone with the perfect genetic makeup for competitive skiing is living in a favela in Brazil. Of course, that person would be unlikely to ever hit the Winter Olympic Games, for geographical and financial reasons. Studies of top swimmers show that they tend to come from families with a decent income. If they didn’t, they’d be unable to travel around to competitions. They also tend to come from places like southern California, where the sun shines all year round and there are plenty of pools. To add to genes, resources and location, you also need mental toughness. Reaching the very top in any field depends on never saying, “I quit.” The likes of Tom Brady, a superstar quarterback, are capable of looking at a loss and criticism as a learning experience time and time again, relentlessly focusing on improvement and exercising unyielding self-control. Master this, and you’ll be that much closer to becoming a five-time Super Bowl winner. It’s easy to believe in hard work. A gold medalist is more likely to talk about her years of training than her superior genetic makeup, and she may neglect to mention that she grew up next door to a track and was raised by parents who paid for exclusive coaching. Sure, hard work is important. But it’s not enough on its own. How do you spend your downtime? Working tirelessly on a side project that, someday, may lead to major success? Or watching Netflix in your sweatpants? Self-control, and investing time and effort in activities that are only rewarding in the long-term, is a great way to generate successful, apparently lucky outcomes. Meet Derek Sivers. He’s a millionaire who set up a company called CD Baby back in the 1990s. Sivers had created a credit-card account to sell CDs of his own music. CD Baby was born when a friend asked him if he would help set up a website for independent bands to sell their CDs. The site was created over the course of a weekend and later sold at a value of $22 million. What luck! A chance conversation that led, decades later, to a multimillion-dollar payout! Except it wasn’t really luck. Among his friends, Sivers was known as “the robot.” He had a long attention span and was happy to block out the world and work nonstop for a weekend if he wanted to master a new skill. When, in 1993, he first heard of the internet, he didn’t just start exploring it; he taught himself HTML so he could create his own websites. Unfortunately, it’s hard to improve your ability to self-regulate your behavior, so don’t get too despondent if you struggle with willpower. Our brain finds it easier to do things that we’ve done many times before – that’s why adults who have tied a tie every morning for ten years can do it on autopilot. Doing things that don’t come naturally, like tying a tie for the very first time, or teaching yourself HTML instead of watching old episodes of Friends, requires us to use the most energy-demanding part of our brain, the prefrontal cortex. If learning new skills feels like hard work, that’s because it really is. The good news is that, though arduous, self-improvement isn’t impossible. We can all get better at self-discipline by employing tricks like physically moving short-term temptations away (no more cookies in the cupboard!) and picturing the eventual reward of long-term decisions (do I want another cocktail now, or a house in ten years?). So cultivate your self-discipline, and when a lucky opportunity pops up, you’ll be well placed to capitalize on it, just as Derek Sivers was. Who you know is more important than what you know. Yes, it’s a cliché but for a good reason as it contains an element of truth. You may be the best in the world at what you do, but if you don’t make the right social connections, you won’t get any lucky breaks. In 1989, sociologist Katherine Giuffre tried to get an idea of how social connections affected success by examining the people and relationships within the New York fine art photography scene. She found three groups. First, there were strugglers – people who were unsuccessful in their careers. Second, there was a group of photographers with stable, long-term connections with the same curators and artists. They were doing okay, but their careers weren’t taking off. And then there was the third group – successful photographers regularly receiving attention from major art journals. This group was different. Its members had more social ties and knew more people, who, in turn, knew still more people. In short, they had a huge network. Giuffre noted that a lot of art delivered by the first two groups was simply filtered out into obscurity. The art wasn’t necessarily worse – in some cases, it was mind-blowing – but the photographers lacked the right social connections to get ahead. So a fine art photographer who can strike up a positive, engaging conversation with anyone is more likely to get ahead, and the same goes for all of us. But most of us can’t effortlessly chat up a journalist at a gallery opening. We enter into social interactions with nervousness or inhibitions, or we misinterpret the meaningless gestures of our interlocutor. We see them cross their arms and interpret it as “stay away,” not simply “I forgot my sweater today.” This kind of caginess can easily inhibit real connections, so, to get around it, you should demonstrate expressive interest in other people. Make crystal clear that you are genuinely interested in the other person. Send unmistakably friendly signals, like smiles and leaning in, and make open, welcoming gestures. If you are unmistakably pleasurable to be around, people will open up and warm to you quickly. Remember that humans are social animals. Just as we’re hardwired to enjoy sex and food consumption, we’re instinctively drawn to friendly smiles and welcoming body language. Tony Hsieh’s first business failure came when he was nine years old. His business plan was simple. Acquire a box of worms. Let them reproduce. Sell the new worms for a profit. Sadly, his due diligence didn’t identify a risk: all the worms might escape, along with any prospect of profit (this happened). But Hsieh wasn’t deterred from an entrepreneurial life. He was relentlessly curious and loved to explore new opportunities. He started a newsletter as a child and sold advertising space. At Harvard, he learned about bartending and – less conventionally – how to milk cows. He turned a profit by buying McDonald’s burgers for $1 and reselling them in dorms for $3. Hsieh never set out to be CEO of an online shoe retailer. In fact, when an entrepreneur first pitched him the idea of Zappos, Hsieh demurred. He wasn’t particularly passionate about or interested in shoes. But, as ever, he was curious. The market opportunity intrigued him. And it’s good that it did, because, by 2008, Zappos was turning over $1 billion in sales. Eventually, Amazon acquired the company, making Hsieh a multimillionaire. Many people aren’t curious, and, as a result, they neither get nor take any shots at success. As we’ve seen, our default mental setting is to stick with the familiar. The unknown – for instance, turning up at a party where we don’t know anyone – often feels threatening. Our brain switches to inhibition mode and we do nothing. Being cautious, or curious, about new things is self-perpetuating. If you don’t go to that party, you are missing a chance to get better at handling new things, and your commitment to the status quo strengthens. If you do go to that party, perhaps you’ll meet someone new, who will invite you to another party, and then another, until you eventually meet someone special – your future spouse, perhaps, or a new friend or an entrepreneur with a great business idea. So try to recognize that while your brain’s default is to stick to the familiar, you can make the decision to do something new. And there are ways to make that easier. You can build your social network because friends often help us do new things. Or you can save money, so you have a cushion if you want to take some risks. Or you can reduce your stress levels and work on your confidence so that taking that leap into the unknown feels easier. Say yes to things. Stay curious. In the end, you might just get lucky. The key message in these blinks: Life often feels random, as though luck is what separates the best from the rest. And it’s true that many events are outside of our control. But when we start to understand how our brains work, and how invisible biases and patterns influence our behavior, we can learn how to be luckier. So do your best to position yourself for luck. Expand your social network, stay curious and say yes to new opportunities. Actionable advice: Maximize your lucky opportunities by regularly trying new things.   Try out and learn different activities as much as possible. Learn computer programming, study French or try out a new sport. Maybe you’ll stumble upon a world-class talent you never knew you had, or meet your next business partner in class. At worst, you’ll get a better idea of what you truly enjoy doing! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Somehow we always find an excuse not to head to the gym after work or to skip that weekend run. But what would it be like to live your life with no excuses for not giving 100 percent? Well, in these blinks you’ll find out because that’s exactly how the author, David Goggins, lives. We’ll go on a journey and discover this incredible man’s extraordinary life story. From his traumatic childhood and overweight twenties to his amazing transformation into one of the world’s fittest soldiers, we’ll learn what it takes to become one of the fittest people on the planet. Through searing honesty and unbelievable anecdotes, we’ll find out just how Goggins turned his life around to achieve the near-impossible – and how you can emulate his success. Read on to discover how Goggins’ childhood shaped him; why he almost dropped out of the military altogether; and what awaits you in Badwater 135. For many American children, childhood is a carefree time full of play, security and parental love. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out that way for David Goggins. Born in New York in 1975, Goggins never knew the simple joys of childhood. Instead, from the tender age of six, Goggins, along with his mother and older brother, was a slave to his tyrannical father, Trunnis. A self-made businessman, Trunnis owned a roller-disco rink, and his workforce was none other than his young family. Almost every night of the week, Goggins’ father took his wife and kids out to his skating rink, where he made them work tirelessly until midnight. Between the ages of six and eight, David’s job was to look after the skating shoes. His mother would cook their dinner over a hot plate in the rink’s office, and after the children had finally finished work at around midnight, she would put them to bed in the office too. Unfortunately, the thumping music from the dance floor made sleep almost impossible, and Goggins regularly fell asleep in school, unable to concentrate on his lessons. While this grueling routine of school and late-night work would have been intolerable for any young child, the sickening brutality of Goggin’s father made life all but unbearable. David often witnessed his father beating his mother with a belt when she dared to disobey him. Once, when David contracted a bad ear infection, she dared to take him to the hospital. Trunnis hated spending money on his family, even when his children’s health was at risk. When his mother returned from the hospital, Trunnis beat her senseless. Whenever David tried to intervene to protect his mother, he was belted too. He often had to hide the bruises and angry red welts his father’s belt had given him. Thankfully, when David was eight years old, he and his mother escaped from their tormentor. His mother sweet-talked his father into letting her get a credit card in her name, and with the help of a sympathetic neighbor, she planned her escape. After hurriedly leaving Trunnis’s house, David and his mother drove to the small town of Brazil, Indiana, where they started a new life free from Trunnis. But their newfound freedom was bittersweet. Why? Because David’s older brother decided to stay with their father, despite his cruelty, meaning that David saw him little after they left. Unfortunately, David’s life in Indiana wouldn’t be free from hardship either. David Goggins may have escaped his abusive father, but that didn’t mean the rest of his childhood was any easier. In small-town Indiana, he would spend the rest of his formative years grappling with poverty and the demons of his past. As soon as the initial euphoria of fleeing from Trunnis wore off, David and his mother had a new and harsh reality to face: they were suddenly dirt poor. Trunnis refused to give his wife and child more than a pittance to support themselves in their new life. David and his mother lived in a public housing block where they paid seven dollars a month in rent and eked out an existence on her part-time job and a $123 monthly welfare check. As if poverty wasn’t challenging enough, the traumatic effects of David’s early years began to make themselves known when he was in the third grade. After years of suffering at the hands of his father, David developed a nervous stutter, his hair started to fall out, and patches of his skin lost pigment and turned a different color. Why did this happen? As an adult, David realized that he was suffering from toxic stress. This is a phenomenon in which young children who have undergone severe abuse experience long-term changes to their brain chemistry, resulting in a permanent state of “fight or flight.” In other words, David had been through so much that his brain and body were now permanently on high alert for danger. As David soon found out, a devastating side effect of toxic stress is its limiting effect on children’s memories. When suffering from this condition, even the most gifted child will struggle to remember the things they’ve previously learned in school. In David’s case, this meant that he was labeled as stupid by some of his teachers. Already the only black kid in his class, he now faced being yelled at and ridiculed on a daily basis. Faced with the prospect of being kicked out of school altogether and placed in a “special needs” facility, David began doing the only thing he could think of to get by. He started cheating – on his homework and on important standardized tests. The result? His oblivious teachers allowed him to stay in school, but his education suffered terribly. Heading into his teenage years, unbeknownst to anyone else, David could barely read. As a teenager, David still struggled with school and literacy. But in his late teens, he finally locked on to something concrete to do with his life: join the United States Air Force. Buoyed by hopes of becoming a military man, he buckled down, learned to read and was accepted into Air Force training. Unfortunately, his path to success wouldn’t be a smooth one. David’s dream was to become an Air Force pararescue, a special type of soldier who specializes in parachuting into war zones and rescuing injured pilots. To complete his training, David would have to face his toughest test yet: swimming. David’s mother had not been able to afford swimming lessons for him, and he was 12 years old before he even saw a pool. This meant that when he began military training, he desperately lacked the sort of swimming ability necessary for him to make the cut. Paralyzed with fear and facing increasingly tough swimming challenges, he eventually took the easy way out by quitting. When a routine medical test picked up a predisposition to sickle cell anemia, a blood disease, David used it as his excuse to walk away from the military on medical grounds. Even as he was leaving, he knew he should stay and fight through his challenges, but fear got the better of him. By 1999, with his military hopes vanquished, 24-year-old David was working a dead-end job as a night-shift pest exterminator and using food to numb his disappointment. After his discharge from the Air Force, he ballooned from 255 pounds to almost 300 as his eating spiraled out of control. As soon as his pest exterminator shift ended, the first thing he did was stop off on the way home for a chocolate milkshake and a box of doughnuts – and that was just breakfast number one. After this, he would drive to his mother’s house where she had prepared his usual morning meal. Unbelievably, this consisted of eight cinnamon rolls, six eggs, ten bacon rashers and copious amounts of sugary cereal. Sadly, David was using food to cope with the bitter realities of his life: that he was uneducated, unskilled, and heading toward a dead-end future. Luckily, the motivation he needed to turn his mediocre life around was waiting just around the corner. One morning, after binging on another massive breakfast, Goggins saw something on television that would change his life forever: a documentary about Navy SEALS in training. SEALS are widely regarded as the most elite fighting force in the world, and SEAL training is the toughest in the world – only the best make it through. Watching SEAL recruits struggling through mud, sweat and tears, Goggins was transfixed by their mental toughness, their determination to fight through suffering and their peak physical conditioning. Suddenly, he wanted to join them more than he had ever wanted anything. Goggins spent the next few weeks phoning Navy recruitment offices across the United States, pleading for the opportunity to train as a SEAL. As luck would have it, there was a training program open to former military recruits who wanted to become active again by joining the Navy. Goggins was told he could use this program to join the SEAL training program. Unfortunately, there were two problems. Firstly, this program was going to be shut down in three months. Secondly, Goggins was far too heavy to join the Navy. The maximum weight allowed was 191 pounds, and he was 297 pounds. This meant he had less than three months to lose over 100 pounds of weight if he wanted to have any hope of trying out for the SEALS. Undeterred, Goggins got to work. Over the next three months, he set up a punishing fitness regimen. Waking up at 4.30 am every day, he immediately hit an exercise bike for two hours. After that, he’d drive to the nearest pool and complete a two-hour swim. Then it was off to the gym for an intense workout that included circuit training and at least five sets of 200 reps for all the major muscle groups. After the gym, he’d hop back on the exercise bike for another few hours. After dinner, it was back on the bike again for two more punishing hours. Remarkably, within two weeks he had lost 25 pounds, and within a month he began adding four-mile runs to his daily routine. When the deadline for enrolment came around, Goggins was fighting fit. He joined the program and underwent a grueling training period that included going five and a half days with minimal sleep and completing tough exercise drills while soaked with water and covered in sand. However, Goggins gritted his teeth, graduated from the training and eventually achieved his dream of joining the Navy SEALs. Goggins had achieved his ambition to become a Navy SEAL, but after a few years, he found himself hungry for new challenges. What would test his physical capabilities to the limit, the way SEAL training once had? In 2005 he found the answer: extreme long-distance running, or ultra running. Goggins began ultra running to contribute to a good cause. When several of his fellow Navy SEALS were killed in a military operation in Afghanistan, Goggins decided to raise money for the families they left behind. This way he could combine charity with his quest to complete the toughest foot race on earth. The race he chose was called Badwater 135, a 135-mile race that includes the most challenging elevations and sweltering heat of any race in the world. Known as the ultramarathon to end all ultramarathons, it begins below sea level in California’s Death Valley and finishes at an elevation of 8,374 feet. As if this weren’t enough, Badwater 135 is always run in July, when Death Valley is often the hottest place on the planet. Incredibly, top competitors complete the course in under 48 hours. Before Goggins could compete in Badwater 135, the race’s organizers required him to qualify by competing in another 100-mile race. So he set out to conquer the San Diego One Day – a 100-mile race in the heart of the city. Amazingly, he completed this first race without any special training at all. In fact, the only cardio he had been doing during the year leading up to this race was 20 minutes a week on a cross-trainer in the gym! Although he suffered greatly along the route, experiencing loss of bladder and bowel control due to sheer exertion, he completed the race in just 19 hours – even running an extra mile just to make sure he really had finished. After this triumph, Goggins was accepted as a 2006 Badwater-135 competitor. This time he trained as hard as he could in preparation for the race. Not only did he carefully study the terrain he would run but he also trained in the kind of extreme heat in which the race would be run. When race day came around, all his training paid off, and Goggins completed Badwater 135 in just 30 hours, coming in fifth place. Because Goggins is one of the United States’ only African-American SEALS and a prolific ultra runner, people often ask him how they can become as successful as him. His first piece of advice comes down to one thing: work ethic. It’s a sad fact that our society has become addicted to quick fixes. But Goggins believes that if you want to master yourself and harness your true potential, there’s no quick fix – only hard work. You may have tons of talent and passion, but without a work ethic to match, you’re a bird without wings – you’ll never fly. Goggins’ willingness to work hard is the crucial factor in every one of his accomplishments. Whether he’s working out in the gym or working as a SEAL, everything else in his life comes second; working hard is the biggest priority in his life. Interestingly, when he tells people about the value of hard work, they typically say that they don’t have the time to put in the long hours needed to achieve their goals. Instead, they say, they have to focus on spending time with their family or working at their desk job. But Goggins doesn’t accept this excuse. In his opinion, all these doubters need to do is win the morning. Goggins has achieved so much because he gets up early to do it. To have a chance at a similar level of success, you need to be an early bird too. A typical day for Goggins starts at 4 am when he immediately gets up and goes for a six-to-ten-mile run. By heading out so early, he can be back home by 5.15 am, ready to shower and have breakfast. As if this weren’t enough, he then bikes 25 miles to work, arriving at his desk by 7.30 am. And his strict fitness regimen doesn’t stop then. During his lunch break, he’ll find time for a gym session or another six-mile run on a nearby beach. After work, he cycles home again, and by the time he walks back through the front door at 7 pm, he’s found the time to cycle 50 miles, run at least ten more, and work a nine-to-five desk job. So get up early tomorrow morning and start pushing yourself. Because if David Goggins can do it, you can too! The key message in these blinks: David Goggins overcame a violent, traumatic and impoverished childhood, and emerged with the dream of joining the army. After overcoming his difficulties in swimming and losing huge amounts of weight, he eventually emerged as a superfit Navy SEAL and a successful ultramarathon runner. Emulating his success is possible – it just takes an extraordinary amount of hard work and getting up early in the morning. Actionable advice: Go beyond with the 40 percent rule. Goggins invented the 40 Percent Rule because we typically give up and go home when we have expended only 40 percent of our potential effort. Why? Well, there’s a part of our mind that wants to protect us from suffering and hardship, so it tricks us into believing we’ve already given everything we’ve got when really we still have 60 percent left in the tank! To master our minds, we have to push through the suffering and ignore the voice in our head so we can give our true best every time. Got feedback?

A couple of the ingredients are pretty obvious. You’ll need a job you love, for one. A little old-fashioned elbow grease won’t hurt, either. Add a dash of social smarts and topnotch communication skills to the mix and you’re all set. But we’re still missing one key factor – the stimuli that kickstart and support your growth. Think of them as catalysts: the magic people and actions that precipitate success. Whether it’s a boss who encourages you to answer your own questions, or learning why it’s so important to postpone gratification, these are the active ingredients that can accelerate your career without leaving you feeling burned out. The tips and tricks in these blinks are designed for long-term and sustainable success. Start putting them into action today and there’s no telling how far you can go. Along the way, you’ll learn Why fretting about that next promotion is a waste of time; What the fabled race between the tortoise and the hare tells us about timing; and Some telltale signs that your next boss is a good match for you. Today’s business world is a rat race. Getting ahead means moving up the ladder – the higher, the better. That’s the general idea, at least. In reality, careers rarely progress as swiftly or smoothly as we’d like. It’s easy to feel frustrated. So let’s take a fresh look at your relationship with your job. A good way to start is by letting go of the illusion of control. Remember, your career progression isn’t solely up to you. Like a ship sailing its way across the ocean, a typical 40-year career has to make the best of unpredictable headwinds and tailwinds. Sometimes an industry booms and people in that sector with specialized skills are suddenly in high demand. If you’re one of those people, this tailwind will help carry you toward your destination: promotion and a bigger paycheck. At other times, though, headwinds check your progress. Just think of someone who’s been a committed, loyal employee of the same company for years, waiting for an opportunity to get promoted. Then, when her boss finally announces his retirement, management announces a new strategy and the position she worked so hard to reach is eliminated completely! Careers might be unpredictable, but that doesn’t mean you need to let the worry over promotions and raises stress you out. Instead, your best bet is to focus on your own personal growth. That means gaining professional experience, and improving and expanding your skillset. Imagine you’re a baseball batter. If you concentrate on hitting each ball tossed your way as perfectly as possible, there’s a pretty good chance you’ll win the game. Step up to the plate with nothing on your mind but winning the game, though, and you’ll probably be so nervous that you’ll end up missing every time you swing. Careers are just like that. If you take your professional life one swing at a time rather than obsessing over the big picture, you’ll end up excelling. Interviews are often pretty formulaic, so you can usually guess a lot of the questions that’ll come up long before you’ve walked through the door. Top of the list? Experience. Usually, you’ll say you’ve been a manager, a lawyer, an accountant for fifteen years – and the interview moves on. But what do all those years actually tell us about the quality of someone’s experience? Not a lot. Simply doing something doesn’t mean you’re good at it. Think of it this way: if someone asked you how much experience you have sleeping or walking, you’d probably laugh at the question. You do them on autopilot – it doesn’t make sense to talk about them in terms of “experience.” But telling your potential future boss that you have five years’ experience as an HR manager doesn’t so much as raise an eyebrow. The implicit assumption is that you’ve spent that half-decade actively learning and improving your performance. The problem is simple: Take a look around pretty much any office in the world and you’ll instantly disprove that idea. Plenty of people complete their daily tasks without giving them any thought whatsoever. That isn’t real experience!   Experience is the fruit of an active learning process. That process has three stages: practice, reviewing your performance and taking steps to improve in the future. To see how it works, imagine a sales manager called Mr. B. Mr. B’s performance is usually only reviewed in terms of his sales figures. When it comes to gaining experience, though, what really matters is what he’s learning from each unit of time he spends working. So if he’s recently helped hire new staff members, Mr. B should take a moment to look back over the interviews and assess what went well, what went wrong and what could be improved. Then, when he interviews the next candidate, he should work on putting those insights into practice and perfecting his interviewing skills. That also goes for every sales interaction he has with customers. Why? Because actively and critically assessing your performance makes you more mindful of your shortcomings and what you can do to fix them.   What do the most successful people have in common? Here’s one thing: they’ve all contributed to a major company project from its inception to its completion. This is called a learning cycle. Say a company wants to launch a new product. The team has to identify what the new product needs to work, draft a business plan, develop and test prototypes and finally, implement the necessary infrastructure for production, sales and service. Then, at last, they can launch the product. That’s a full learning cycle. But here’s the caveat: simply attending meetings or watching from the sidelines doesn’t teach you anything. If you want to grow, you have to be proactively engaged in all stages of the project. Taking full responsibility for the success or failure of a project gives you a wealth of insights into problem-solving in different settings. That means that it’s a great idea to start looking for opportunities to get involved in these kinds of learning cycles. After all, simply going through the motions during a regular nine-to-five shift isn’t likely to contribute much to your personal growth. As we saw in the last blink, development is all about active learning. So how do you get yourself involved in big projects? Well, first you’ll want to keep your ears to the ground. Listen to what your bosses and colleagues are talking about. If you hear about an exciting new project, speak up and put your name forward. If you don’t catch word of anything, your best bet is to create your own opportunities. You can do that by taking the initiative and spearheading improvements to your workflow. If you’re a factory manager, for example, you might want to look into expanding a certain area of activity. Or, if you’re an IT specialist, you could start developing tools to automate irksome decision-making processes within your company. We all know about the tortoise and the hare. Here’s a new way to think about it: while you obviously want to hit the ground running when you start your career, it’s vital that you don’t peak too soon. Typically, people focus on the first half of their working lives and forget about what comes later. But long-term success is all in the timing – like a marathon runner, you want to hit your stride as you enter the second half of the race.   To see why, let’s take a look at two marketing employees. They’re both hardworking and capable people, and both have done well for themselves. After a decade of experience in their field, both head up marketing departments in decent-sized companies. This is the midpoint of their careers – what happens next is key. The biggest promotion opportunities usually come up at around this point. And that’s where the difference between a tortoise and a hare shows. The former will have conserved his energy, and he’ll be ready to take things to the next level. Chances are, she’s going to make the leap from head of a department to chief marketing officer. The latter, by contrast, will be tiring by this point – she’s pretty much guaranteed to remain in her current position. So how do you make sure you’re setting yourself up for that all-important sprint towards the finish line? You need to learn to avoid instant gratification and keep your eyes on the prize. Imagine a young artist just getting started. She decides to do a five-year apprenticeship with a well-established artist. That kind of experience can be pretty frustrating. Even if you do great work, the person above you gets her name on the final product. It’d be tempting to call it quits and go it alone, right? Sure, but if our budding artist strikes out alone, she’s guaranteed to miss out on foundational skills. And without those, her career will suffer setbacks further down the line. Imagine the following scenario: You’re a young office worker with about five years of experience under your belt. One day, a competing firm reaches out to you. Their old boss has unexpectedly quit and they’re convinced you’re the right person for the job. You’ve just been offered your first senior position – great news, right? Not quite. As we saw in the last blink, there’s a good reason to take things slow when you’re just starting out on your professional journey. Snap up that company’s offer and you might just end up missing out on something vital: the chance to really focus on going deep in your work and improving your skills. Typically, that’s something you’ll only ever really get to do once, in the first half of your career. Let’s look at two frontline company workers, Amit and Vijay, to see how this works. They have entirely different approaches to building their careers: Amit spends years at the same firm while Vijay switches employer and city every year. Now fast forward three years. Who’s in a better position? Well, Vijay’s roaming has given him one advantage: plenty of insights into market conditions in different areas of the country. But Amit has something much more valuable – a bigger skills toolkit. Having spent the previous 36 months with just one company, he’s had the chance to see the results of his work and improve his performance. More importantly, everything Vijay learned is easily replaceable. After all, it’s pretty simple to get the lowdown on market conditions online or through contacts. Amit’s knowledge, by contrast, is much harder to replace. That’s partly because deepening your experience gives you a valuable opportunity to hone one of the most important skills of all – problem solving. When you’re a newbie in a company, it’s easy to spot things people who’ve been there longer than you have missed. These are low-hanging fruits, and picking them gives you lots of easy wins. Hang around a little longer, though, and you’ll be forced to raise your game. Do that long enough and you’ll become a master at solving more tricky issues, and that’s bound to stand you in good stead throughout your career. Our age has become increasingly individualistic. Everyone, the argument goes, is responsible for their own success. That’s not necessarily wrong, but it does leave out something important: virtually everything you pick up along your journey is learned from someone else. More often than not, that person is your superior. That’s why it’s so vital to work with the right bosses. But before we get to how you can seek out the best in the business, let’s take a closer look at the two different kinds of boss you’ll likely encounter during the first half of your career. The first is the results-driven boss, who is all about making sure you’re hitting your targets. Expect to receive plenty of nudges reminding you about deadlines and frequent checks on your progress. Then there’s the second variety of boss. Like the first, they’re committed to getting results. That isn’t their only concern, though – they’re just as interested in your personal growth, too. That makes this type of boss a kind of mentor. Expect them to encourage you to answer your own questions, even when they know the answer, and they’ll likely take an interest in what you’ve learned during projects as well. When you take that into account, it’s pretty easy to see that the second type of boss is much more likely to aide your professional development. Which brings us to the million-dollar question: where do you find them? Well, there are two surefire ways to tell that a company has great leaders. The first is to look at whether it’s hiring the most talented people out there. If a ton of high achievers are flocking to a given firm and, just as importantly, staying there, you can be pretty sure that there are some great bosses pulling the strings behind the scenes. The second approach is more direct: seek out a company insider and ask them to give you the lowdown on the organization’s internal culture and the way it evaluates its employees. If the boss is interested in results and not much else, give the company a pass. If there’s a greater emphasis on self-development and mentoring, congratulations – you might just have found your next employer! Remember how the most successful people all have experience in seeing projects through from start to finish? Well, there’s another thing the author noticed while observing senior executives in major companies: they’re all passionate about challenging hobbies. These aren’t just any old pastimes, however. In fact, they’re usually what the author calls striving sports. These are competitive, individualistic and difficult to truly master – think of running, cycling, swimming or golf. More importantly, they encourage you to focus on yourself. Whether you’re competing in a race or teeing up shots, your aim is always the same: to beat your previous record. That’s a pretty handy skill in the boardroom. After all, putting your company on the path to success in a competitive market is all about surpassing limits and taking things to the next level. Striving sports keep executives in that mindset even when they’re not at their desks. But wait, isn’t a bit of time out a good thing? And don’t executives already have more than enough challenging work? Sure, but here’s the thing to remember: once you reach a senior position, your focus shifts from personal achievements to encouraging an entire team to excel. Take an engineer who’s worked his way up the corporate ladder. At the start of his career, he was tasked with solving practical problems on the ground. But now, he has to concentrate on hiring other engineers and making sure everyone is pulling together to achieve shared goals. That has upsides and downsides. On the one hand, your work has greater purpose once you’re responsible for the whole company’s welfare. On the other hand, it’s easy to end up feeling like your fiercely competitive inner nature doesn’t have an outlet anymore. And that’s where striving sports come in. Think of them as a pressure valve. An executive can let off a bit of steam by, say, running a marathon. Then, when he turns up to work, he’ll have a clear head and be ready to focus on more team-oriented projects. The world is full of leaders. Every nation, region, community, religious group, council and company has one or more leaders. But not all of them are cut from the same cloth. Some are merely obeyed while others inspire intense loyalty. So let’s look at the difference between humdrum leaders and exceptional ones. There are a couple of factors. Let’s start with a leader’s position and message. One way to measure the effectiveness of a leader is by looking at how many followers she has and how much influence she has over them. Generally speaking, the more senior a leader’s position, the more trust she’ll inspire in her followers. That’s why a CEO usually commands more respect than a vice president. That said, winning over followers isn’t simply a matter of sitting behind the right desk – it’s also about the message you’re communicating. Let’s say the CEO of a marketing firm believes that the company should avoid wasting its time on small brands. That stance will partly determine what kind of followers she’ll gain, and how many. After all, it’s a divisive view: some people will agree, and others will regard it as wrongheaded or shortsighted. The most important criterion, however, is morality. Leaders who promote a strong ethical vision and stand up for their values often win the largest followings. Take Mahatma Gandhi, the spiritual leader of India’s struggle for independence from its British colonial masters. Gandhi led by example: his modest life, rejection of materialism, frugality and honesty made him one of the most inspirational political leaders in the country. Gandhi’s strong moral code suggested that he really meant what he said. While other public figures appeared self-interested and untrustworthy, millions of Indians were convinced that Gandhi was the best champion of the cause they believed in – self-rule and a nation of their own. That just goes to show how important it is to develop your own value system before aspiring to become a leader. The key message in these blinks: If you want to build a successful career, your best bet is to learn to think strategically. That starts with reminding yourself that you’re in this for the long haul and taking it slow, especially at the start of your professional journey. That’s when you’ll have the time and opportunity to do things you won’t get many other chances at: honing your skills, becoming a world-beating problem solver and focusing on your personal growth. Once those foundations are in place, you’ll be perfectly set up to hit the afterburners and power through the second half of your career.  Actionable advice: Set and follow your own high ethical standards rather than the group’s. We’ve seen how important it is for people in charge to lead by example. But you don’t have to wait until you’re promoted to a senior position to start setting and living up to your own high moral standards rather than blindly following the crowd. So, say tardiness has become an accepted part of your company’s culture. If you don’t think it’s okay, you have to do something about it. And that’s something you can start doing today. Got feedback?

You’ll no longer spend time and energy worrying about things you can’t change, and you’ll instead focus on more creative and meaningful ventures. \nStop letting other make decisions for you. You’ll lose the fear of rejection that makes most people passive pawns of others’ decisions. Instead, you yourself will take control of achieving your dreams. \nStop surrounding yourself with the wrong people. You’ll learn to distance yourself from people who just drain your energy and make you angry. If you were to ask your parents about their ambitions as they were growing up, many of them would probably tell you, “I wanted to get an education, get a steady job and then buy my own house.” From the end of World War II until the global financial crisis in 2008, the population of the United States was living The American Dream. What was behind this dream? In a word: work. Early in this period, as men went off to fight in Europe, many women entered the workforce. Yet when the war was over and soldiers came home, women continued to work. For the first time, both men and women in significant numbers were wage earners, putting food on the table and paying the bills. With two people working, families had more disposable income than ever before. This meant that they could purchase cars, bigger houses and new appliances, experiencing a standard of living of which their parents could only have dreamed. However, behind the shiny facade of the American Dream was something sinister: a marketing strategy designed to get people to spend money. Americans were increasingly encouraged to express themselves with their cash, showing off their successes by owning more stuff than their neighbors. Since the advent of 2008 financial crisis, however, the American Dream has come to an end. Steady, middle-class jobs are a thing of the past. To reduce costs, companies have either outsourced jobs to developing countries or simply replaced employees with technology. Today, many jobs are only temporary, and offer a worker no security or freedom. Millions of people encouraged to invest in their education, then find a steady job and live the American Dream are now either unemployed, or overqualified and underpaid for what they do. It’s a devastating story. But should we be sad about it? As you’ll see, there’s a positive side to the death of the American Dream, as it has led to a new, promising era. So the American Dream is over. But that’s not a bad thing. We are now moving into a new era of personal freedom. The previous era of working and spending was dependent on other people controlling your life. To succeed in the American Dream, you needed someone else to “choose you.” For example, if you wanted a better job, you had to keep your head down and work hard, hoping your boss would notice you and single you out for a promotion. This was true even in the creative industries. For instance, if you’d written a good play, book or TV show, you’d have to wait to be chosen by the gatekeepers – the industry executives – as only they could turn your idea into a successful reality. Today, the world is a different place. You no longer need anyone else to make you a success. Instead, you can – you must – choose yourself. Since the only jobs for you in the corporate world are temporary ones, you have to step outside this realm and empower yourself. But how? Aside from self-confidence, all you need is a smartphone or a laptop with an internet connection, and you can do whatever you want. If you’ve written a book, you don’t need a publisher or an agent; publish the book yourself online. If you’ve created a TV show, you don’t need to pitch it to others; post it on YouTube to reach your audience. By choosing yourself, you also avoid falling into the trap of just chasing money. The basis of the American Dream was the need to earn more and then buy more. As long as the work you did paid for this lifestyle, it simply didn’t matter that you were essentially unhappy. The new era is different. We have the freedom to do what we want, and if we make money doing it, then we will be happy! Have you ever stared across a coffee shop at someone you thought could be the love of your life? If you have, chances are you did nothing about it. But it’s not just you: most of us would rather wait for the person we desire to come and talk to us. Why? Because, above all, we fear rejection, and we’ll do anything to avoid it. This fear of rejection is behind our feeling that we have to let others “choose” us. Most of us simply believe we aren’t good enough, and that to succeed, we must let others (teachers, bosses, publishers and so on) decide for us. To better understand this attitude, Yale psychology professor Stanley Milgram performed a study. Milgram instructed a few students to use the subway and ask sitting passengers to give up their seats for them. The result? An unbelievable 70 percent of passengers gave up their seats – without asking any questions. As this suggests, most people are prepared to let others determine their choices for them. We must stop thinking this way. Instead of fearing rejection and letting others choose for us, we should make our own decisions and empower ourselves to choose. The alternative? We let others decide our future – in which case, we expose ourselves to rejection and become unhappy when we are rejected. This very thing happened to the author, who’d developed a TV project called III:am (for HBO) which he put a great deal of work into. Yet to get it made, he depended on one person in a TV company to say “yes.” Ultimately, the company said “no,” the project came to sudden stop, and all of that work went to waste. This is no way to live one’s life! You have to make yourself the only person who can control your dreams. But it’s easy to say that you’re not going to let anybody control your dreams. Doing it is a lot more difficult. So how do you get over the fear of rejection? How do you “choose yourself”? Find out in the following blinks. So, you’re fired up and ready to start living in the “choose yourself” era! But how do you start? It can be quite daunting, to go out and sell yourself – and face rejection – on a daily basis. To prep yourself for this, day in and day out, you have to develop a solid foundation. This means taking care of your four “bodies”: the physical, the mental, the emotional and the spiritual. Let’s look at the first two: physical and mental. Our physical body is, obviously, an essential part of our life, allowing us to thrive. For that reason, we need to stay healthy and fit. Looking after one’s physical body is straightforward: get enough sleep, around seven to nine hours a night; eat just two meals per day, not three; get regular exercise and fresh air; and so on. Caring for your mental body, on the other hand, is a little more tricky. Most of us waste mental energy by compulsively overthinking and worrying about things we can’t control. This is an easy habit to develop, and the consequences are serious: worrying about or fearing things you have no control over will lead to burnout. To rein in this problematic habit, you have to train your mind to work toward positive ends. And the best way to do this is to train your idea muscle. Try daily to read or skim certain chapters from four works on a variety of subjects (ranging from celebrity memoirs to scientific tomes). Then note down at least 10 ideas. The content of these ideas is not important – they could be grand ideas, like solving world hunger; or more modest ones, such as a list of ways to please your partner. The main thing is that you generate ideas and set them down. You’ll soon find yourself with no time to worry about pointless things, as you’ll be too tired from generating useful ideas! In the previous blink, we learned that having the confidence to “choose yourself” depends on having healthy physical and mental bodies. But that’s not all you need. There are two more bodies you have to nourish: your emotional and spiritual bodies. Your emotional body is important: to “choose yourself” and thrive, you have to eradicate negativity and be positive. But how to achieve this? Stop surrounding yourself with people who make you angry. We all know the types – these are the kind of people you complain about with your partner or friends, saying “You won’t believe what she said this time!” Maintaining a relationship with this sort of person is a drain on your energy and weakens your emotional health. Therefore you need to gradually distance yourself from people like this. It is, however, important to be kind. As you try to dissolve your negative relationships, try not to be rude. Instead, greet the person warmly if you see her around, but don’t allow yourself to engage any further. By removing this barrier to thinking positively, you’ll nourish your emotional body and increase your ability to thrive. And finally, the spiritual body. A healthy spiritual body comes from existing only in the here and now. Most of us spend much of our daily lives “time traveling,” that is, either regretting the past or worrying about the future, events we can’t do anything about. Time traveling like this leads to burnout and inhibits us from realizing our full potential. To combat this, make an effort to be in the moment, continually focusing on the now. Pay attention to your surroundings. If you’re in a city, take time to look at buildings, exploring their architectural whims, their particular designs. Doing so will keep your mind rooted in the present and stop you from drifting toward the past or future. Now that you know what to do to build a solid foundation, there’s nothing stopping you from getting out there and thriving in the “choose yourself” era. Right? Well, not quite so fast. As enthusiastic as you might be at the start, it’s often difficult to stick to a plan. So how can you stay on task, keeping your four “bodies” healthy and thriving? Simple. We need to build habits through daily routines. Changing your life doesn’t begin with changing external circumstances, such as jobs, friends and so on. Indeed, these changes happen toward the end of the process. Rather, we change our lives by first changing ourselves. But how? The best way to make this internal change is to create a daily routine in which you do something “good” every day. This routine could include such simple maxims as, “No TV or junk food!” or “Think of 10 people you’re glad to have as friends.” Another good habit to establish is to help others as much as you can. Helping others releases large amounts of the hormone oxytocin into your bloodstream. This wonderful chemical (also released during orgasm and childbirth) helps keeping you healthy and calms you. Oxytocin flows through you when you help someone out, or even express gratitude. You can also produce this hormone simply by hugging someone, giving a gift – or even “liking” a friend’s Facebook post. In fact, at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the author himself went to Wall Street and handed out gifts of chocolate to traders and bankers. Not only did this help boost the author’s oxytocin levels, but it also gave the bankers a shot of phenylephylamine – a hormone released by eating chocolate and falling in love. Be honest with yourself. Are you afraid that you haven’t yet found your true purpose in life? The fear that comes from not knowing what to do with our lives is a great source of stress. Yet there’s no reason to worry: some of the world’s most successful people didn’t find their true purpose until much later in life. Colonel Sanders, of the fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken, didn’t make a cent from his special recipe until he started franchising when he was already 65 years old. And it was only after Peter Roget was forced to retire from his job as a physician at 70 when he was inspired to complete and publish his now-famous thesaurus. This suggests that stressing over your “purpose” is quite pointless. Indeed, some people never find their purpose. For that reason, it’s far more important to enjoy yourself and your life and do whatever work pleases you. Many people never realize this. They search for purpose, or strive for success, and when the pressure gets too much, they try to escape. This desire to leave it all behind, disappear and start a new life is called pseudocide. But while it may be possible to start over, doing so won’t make you any happier. Your internal problems – the same stresses and pressures – will still exist. So, instead of aiming to disappear, find a way to truly free yourself from the stresses of life. And one way to do this is through the following meditation exercise. Imagine that you’re homeless, with no goals for the future, and carrying zero baggage from your past. Try to imagine this situation in as much detail as possible. This exercise can help you to truly forget about any stress you might feel, and to momentarily experience what it’s like to be “reborn,” with fewer troubles and anxieties. Getting into the right mind-set and maintaining a strong foundation and healthy bodies is all well and good. But how can you make a living from it? How do you succeed financially in the “choose yourself” era? Let’s look at the example of Bryan Johnson, the entrepreneur behind the multimillion-dollar credit card service Braintree. Johnson previously worked for a credit card processing company, visiting restaurants and businesses to ask them to switch to using his company’s services. He hated this job, especially the fact that he was working for someone else. So, Johnson decided to do it alone, doing essentially the same job but working for his own company. What can we learn from this? First, in the “choose yourself” era, working for someone else is no fun. Second, you have a perfect opportunity to cut out the middleman: don’t work for a company that provides a certain service or product – instead, provide it yourself. If there’s demand for what you offer, you stand a good chance of making your company a success. Johnson’s success depended heavily on his ability to sell himself, which is one of the most important factors in this new “choose yourself” era. One of the best ways to sell yourself is to always consider the bigger picture. It isn’t about getting the best price for every sale (whether you’re selling a product or your entire business) but getting the best value from it. For example, the author worked on creating movie websites for New Line Cinema for just $1,000 per movie – 200 times less than he would usually charge. Why? Because he knew that by working for such an illustrious company, the best designers in the world would flock to join his company. While it wasn’t the best negotiated sale, the author's company gained a lot of value from it. For the longest time, the maxim, “crime doesn’t pay,” seemed idealistic and out of step with reality. Fraudster Bernie Madoff, as just one example, conned people out of an incredible $65 billion in 2008. Although Madoff was arrested before he ever got his hands on the money, for many people his “success” confirmed that the easiest way to earn lots of money was to lie and cheat. But in the “choose yourself” era, this isn’t true. In fact, the only way to succeed today is to be honest. Of course, being dishonest may work in the short term. But regardless of how successful you are, the moment you’re exposed as a liar, your luck will have run out. No one will ever trust you again! (Surely no one will invest with Madoff these days.) Honesty compounds itself – it grows exponentially. But what does that mean? By being truthful and fair, you win people’s trust. Once you’ve done this, they’ll want to stay in business with you, help spread the word about your company, and so on. Moreover, if you fail, those who trust you will be more likely to help you start over again, allowing you to build your business over the long term. Yet if you’re not a completely honest person, learning how to become one isn’t easy. So how can you become more honest? Try incorporating these habits into your daily routine. First, don’t get angry. Anger comes from wanting others to do want you want them to do. Because you hold unrealistic expectations for other people, you’re basically lying to yourself. To stop this, whenever you feel anger toward another person or group, observe exactly how you feel. Then, try to turn it around so you blame yourself rather than someone else. Second, don’t gossip. Ridiculing or mocking someone behind their back is a dishonest thing to do, and whatever you say about that person will undoubtedly get back to him or her in the end. The key message in this book: The American Dream is dead, an era where you had to wait for your superiors to chose you for promotion; today, you must choose yourself. This means reclaiming control over your dreams and taking full responsibility for your success and happiness. Choosing yourself requires that you maintain a healthy emotional and physical foundation as well as establish habits and routines to help you to stick to your plans. Actionable advice: Only do those things that make you happy. Most people go through their lives doing things they don’t want to do, which makes them stressed and unhappy. You should avoid this! Do whatever you think works best for you, and make sure that the hours you work, the clients you take on and the job you do is based on your desires. Believe in yourself! Nothing is more important in the “choose yourself” era than self-empowerment. This can be hard since to varying degrees, we’ve learned to feel worthless. The solution is to develop a mantra: every day, tell yourself that “you love yourself” over and over again. Soon, you’ll begin to notice that your happiness and confidence are increasing.

Have you spent years finely honing your professional skills? Are you still struggling to turn these awesome assets into a substantial success despite all your hard work?  Creatives might be at the top of their game but they still struggle to make the most of those talents in business. They just don’t have the knowledge to master the tricky and competitive commercial world.  But this is where these blinks come in. They explain, in just a few simple steps, how creatives of any stripe can turn their skillsets into viable and profitable businesses. In these blinks, you’ll discover why every creative should bone up on tax law; why it can help to give someone a portion of your profits; and that nothing is more important than a strong portfolio. So you’ve proved that you’re highly adept at your creative skill. Whether you’re an illustrator, graphic designer, writer or photographer, you’ve now decided to go it alone and work as a freelancer. Of course, there’s a lot to think about. So where should you start? Firstly, creating a strong brand identity will set you apart and help you reach your target audience. Selecting the right company name is hugely important. After all, it’s the first impression potential customers get of your business, and something that will endure as your market grows. Using your own name is common for solo freelancers. This might cause you problems later down the line if you plan to collaborate, or you share a name with an established brand: Pat Starbucks, Freelance Web Designer, for instance, might face some legal issues if they went eponymous! So you must check that the name is not already in use. Ideally, your business name will feel right to you and garner positive reactions from others. For example, when Matt, Jenny and Julia of freelance business Also arrived at their name, it caused them to scream with excitement. They loved it, as it didn’t tie them to a particular niche. The next step is to work on your branding: how will you present your business to the world? Your brand should give a strong impression of your business’s identity. Is it about rustic design or a sleek, polished finish?  Whatever you decide on, always ensure your logo, typeface and business card all carry the same feel. You might even consider hiring a specialist to help create your logo, as the better it is, the more professional you’ll look.  Communication, both visual and verbal, also make a huge difference. The way you advertise, conduct business and interact with clients all contribute to your brand identity. Photographer Thayer Allyson Gowdy recommends having a clear, personal style to inspire the potential clients you want to reach within your target market. A unique brand that reflects your personality will convey a strong message about your business. Once you’ve established your brand, it’s time to show the world what you and your business can do. An impressive portfolio is the most powerful tool available to showcase your talents.  One simple way to ensure your portfolio does its job is by keeping it up-to-date. An artist’s style can change over time, so it’s worth maintaining a portfolio that reflects your current output. This makes client interactions smooth, as prospects will know exactly what it is you specialize in, and they’ll be less likely to ask you to produce work you no longer enjoy. If you left college many years ago, avoid including work you did then, as this suggests you’ve done little of worth since. Professional work you have completed will in any case be more impressive, as it demonstrates that your skills have been utilized by real clients. Your portfolio work should also be relevant. Consider your client’s needs when presenting them with your portfolio. Use it to target what they are likely to want from your service.  You may even opt to create different portfolios for different tastes or directions. A photography company, for example, often has a portfolio for professional portraits and another one for family photos. Then, when you receive an inquiry, you can supply the portfolio that’s perfectly suited to it.  Finally, it goes without saying that your portfolio should be professional. Not only should it include examples of professional work you have done, but the whole appearance of the portfolio should be high spec.  For instance, the portfolio should be the right size: perfect for sitting on the table when you meet your client. Also, it should be clean and protect your work from stains and fingerprints. An up-to-date, relevant and professional portfolio will give you the best chance of gaining business.  Designing a brand and developing a portfolio may, for an artist, be the enjoyable parts of starting a business. However, you need your business head screwed on to guarantee profits. A business plan is not to be overlooked – it’s crucial to success. Though they may seem rather dull, business plans are great for setting your goals and determining your needs. These include financial projections and overheads such as office space. Your plan should also feature a clear mission statement. This is an outline of the values you hold and the goals you wish to achieve. Following it will help you stay on the right course. Be prepared to make financial sacrifices at first. Moonlighting is an option, especially for young freelancers, that can guarantee you income while your business is finding its feet. However, this can be exhausting. Your freelancing should always take priority. Illustrator Andrew Bannecker juggled a job as an art director with freelancing for two years before being confident enough that his illustration work could take over full-time. He had to be strategic and put in long hours to pull this off, however. Like Andrew, you’ll need to be prepared to make personal sacrifices. Often this means being thrifty with your money. You could consider moving to a cheaper area, taking on a roommate, or asking your partner to help contribute more. You’ll also save money if you only buy equipment when you need it, and try bartering when making purchases. What you shouldn’t scrounge on, however, are the legalities that a freelance business requires. You will be liable to pay taxes, insurance, and to abide by a host of rules and regulations.  You may need to apply for a business license, register your company name and service mark, and set up a business bank account. Navigating the bureaucracy calmly a step at a time can save you a lot of time and money in the long run. Now it’s time to make sure you spread the word. There are many effective advertising strategies, but some of the most common are the simplest: business cards, websites and blogs. Business cards should always be carried with you, just in case. Small in size, they are perfect for transferring from your wallet to your potential client’s hand. Remember to keep it short and sweet: your name, contact details and an idea of what you do should suffice to grab a customer’s interest. A website is great for showcasing your talents 24/7 to clients all around the world. To create one, begin by securing a domain name that should also be short and simple. Next, you’ll need to develop a clear and easily navigable layout. Clients want to quickly view what you have to offer without having fancy animations crashing their computer. Agent Lilla Rogers uses artists’ websites when selecting whom to represent. She only has time to stay for two to three clicks, so their sites must impress straight away.  A blog can be an even more personalized way of marketing yourself – and more powerful at tapping into different networks, too.  There is more space on a blog to include what you couldn’t elsewhere, like sketches in progress or photographs that didn’t make the final album. Photographer Matt Armendariz describes his blog Mattbites as a way to share tidbits there was no room for elsewhere: anecdotes and outtakes from photoshoots, for instance. This method of networking can help your company reach out further than was previously imaginable. Animator Ward Jenkins started a blog in 2004 that gathered a large following. One of those followers invited Ward to contribute to the Drawn! blog, which has eight contributing bloggers from across the world. Because of a little blog, Ward’s ideas are now reaching a massive global audience. So it’s going well and you’re getting some interest. With a reputation to build, however, think carefully before taking on jobs. As much as you might like to, you cannot say yes to everyone.  When starting out, approach suitable clients. Your input is likely to make a bigger difference to a smaller company, so don’t approach the big guns straight away. Additionally, when approaching the project, research your client. This will allow you to understand their needs better and see where they might want to head so that you can work with them more effectively. Industrial designer Josh Owen recommends finding personal connections with clients when starting out, by using the network of people you know (or have found through your blog). No matter how you make connections, you should always ensure you and your client are a good match before agreeing to the job. Make sure you understand what they want from you, both in terms of content and timescale. Don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions. If it’s not going to work, turn it down. The alternative is far worse: letting a customer down after committing to the job will reflect badly on you and could affect future business opportunities. Andrew Almeter of Almeter Design only works with those whom he feels are the right fit for his business. He looks for opportunities that will help further his career and says no if he knows he won’t enjoy the job. Almeter points out that politely explaining to the would-be client why he wouldn’t be a good fit could mean that client refers you to someone else, so you won’t necessarily lose out in the long run. Being able to pick and choose is at the core of freelancing, so make the most of it! Whether your client has an office down the road from you, or is based on the other side of the planet, maintaining good communication throughout the job is crucial. So how you do this? Ensure that expectations on both sides are clear from the beginning. When you have established the brief, the estimate and the timescale, ensure that both parties sign a contract. This ensures a professional approach and protects you in the case of potential disputes. If the client initiates the contract, make sure you read the small print! Next, send your client a timeline with deadlines for various stages of completion. If this is tight, ensure they are aware of this and that extra fees will apply as a result. Then start discussing communication with your client. The founders of Also and Thayer Allyson Gowdy both prefer face-to-face communication, at least once during a project. The latter will frequently fly to meet her clients. However, this may be impractical, or your customers may prefer video calling, emails or phone calls.  Either way, do remain open with your client, and stay in touch between deadlines or major meetings with quick messages to reassure them they haven’t left your thoughts. Feedback is a vital aspect of communication. It should be constructive, something that’ll help you sculpt the final piece. Make your feedback process more effective by presenting clients with a few options at each step along the way. By keeping them involved, you’ll be more likely to produce something that they love.  If clients don’t take to a particular option, unearth which elements they prefer, and try to combine them. For example, perhaps they like the typeface of one design and the layout of another. Above all, keep dialogue open. You should feel comfortable explaining your creative process and asking questions to ensure you are meeting clients’ needs. While working hard on your design might be fun and rewarding, you can’t make a success of it if you don’t get out what you put in. So take the time to sit down and work out your finances. Consider how much your talent is worth. To secure the ideal job, you may wish to undercut the competition. This option is probably more appropriate for young freelancers or those starting out: it will help build your portfolio and reputation.  However, if you have more experience, your work should come with a higher price tag, and you shouldn’t be afraid to aim for this. If your skill is particularly specialized or if you know you are far more efficient than others in the market, your work is naturally worth more. Over time, as your experience grows, give yourself a pay rise. Experience is valuable, but demand for your work is likely to increase, as well as your overheads: for instance, you may need more office space if your business grows, or to take on an agent. To ensure you turn this income into a profit, keep a clear list of your expenses. List your outgoings along with the amount they cost. This should include business expenses such as travel, utilities and marketing as well as your personal expenses such as rent, clothing and recreation. Bear in mind the amount of savings you wish to make and the amount you wish to reinvest in the business. Tax can claim 25 to 48 percent of net business income, so make sure you’ve planned for this too. Using the above figures, you can calculate how much income you’ll need to make, and thus your baseline hourly fee.  Working out how much to charge can be a balancing act between how much you need to make, how to ensure you get job offers, and how much you think your talent is worth. Time spent considering this, however, will certainly prove valuable. As your business expands, a talent agent may help you spend less time negotiating contracts or sorting out administration and more time simply being creative.  An agent can help secure work and deal with communications. Agencies can be extremely well-connected and know their regular buyers well. This may lead to you gaining opportunities you may have struggled to find on your own.  Agents will do extensive marketing on your behalf. For instance, the Lilla Rogers Agency present their client with marketing options and attend trade shows such as Surtex to exhibit their work. Not only could an agent approach a client for you, but they can also negotiate contracts and manage ongoing relationships. This can save you having to barter over prices and deal with dreary administration tasks. However, using an agent won’t be to everybody’s taste. Without an agent, you get to keep 100 percent of your profits and don’t give a chunk away to pay their fees. Agents’ commision may range from anywhere between 15 to 50 percent of your payment for each job. Think carefully about whether you feel this sacrifice is worth it.  By approaching potential clients yourself, and by negotiating your own fees, you maintain more control over the project and the way you handle your business. This could potentially foster better relationships with customers, and give you the opportunity to make interactions that align with your brand identity.  Illustrator Nina Chakrabarti has never worked with an agent, despite being approached by some. While she used to hate negotiating her own contracts, once she got used to it she was fully able to enjoy the freedom of working without an agent. With a flourishing career to manage, it might be tempting to continue throwing everything you’ve got at continuing your success. However, this can be all-consuming, so it is important to take a step back and ensure a healthy work/life balance. Be aware of signs you are becoming a workaholic and recognize when to step back. If you are seeing less of your family and friends, or having difficulties switching off at night, you might be letting your business take over too much of your life. To minimize this, keep track of your goals. When buried in your work, you risk focusing too much on the everyday and forgetting the wider picture. Take a step back and re-evaluate your goals: both business and personal.  Why not create a long-term timeline? For example: “after one year I will be submitting my portfolio to a top magazine;” followed by “after 3 years I will employ an assistant so I can take more time off.” This will help you see the bigger picture and remind yourself of your priorities. Creating boundaries between your home and work life will also sustain your creative energy. In most cases, this is as simple as maintaining a physical boundary, separating your office space from living space. If you don’t have a separate workspace to operate from, no problem! Designate a particular room in your house to do your work in.  Time boundaries are also important. Just as if you were working in a conventional job, set yourself working office hours where possible. Take breaks where you indulge in a completely non-work-related activity such as yoga, lunch with friends, or just plain old “me time” – whatever that might mean for you. After the first few years of freelancing, you will have gained plenty of experience and have an idea about whether or not you made the right decision. It’s time to ask yourself some key questions. One of them might even be: Is it time to give up? If things aren’t going well, you may want to consider returning to a full-time job as someone else’s employee. If you aren’t getting what you hoped for from freelancing, be it a healthy salary or more time with your family, it is perfectly reasonable to return to full-time work. Remember: giving up doesn’t make you a failure. When applying for jobs you will have a wealth of experience and skills to draw on, having run your own business. If, however, things are going well, you could be faced with the opposite problem. If you’re constantly busy and demand is high, you may wish to consider expanding. Perhaps it’s time to invest in more office space where you can manage larger operations. You could then consider the mass-market, for instance, producing designs for a national brand. In this case, you will likely also need to take on staff – perhaps an assistant or intern at the very least. If you are prepared to share your brand with someone else, partnering is also an option. Although you will have to sacrifice part of your creation, a partner can bring further connections and customers, as well as allowing you more vacation time. However you define success, it is important to regularly consider whether you are achieving it. Maintaining a sense of perspective and keeping your future options open will ensure you remember what matters most, whether that is within freelancing or beyond it. The key message in this book: By taking a considered approach to branding and business when you balance clients’ needs with your own, you’ll create the perfect conditions for a business that showcases your creative talent. Freelancing is a challenge, but with the right tools and mind-set, you’ll be able to carve out a niche of your own that you love! Actionable advice:  Get your facts straight! Before taking the plunge, quitting your day job and starting to freelance, do your research. Ensure you know the industry you plan to work in, unearth some companies that you might be interested in working with and start to foster a network that you can tap into, perhaps through attending events. Preparation is everything! Such research can be done while you’re still at work full-time, and will give you a head start once you dive into freelancing.

Should you prove yourself by demonstrating your power over subordinates? Would you command more respect if you changed your job title? In fact, if you want to become a better leader you’ll need to forget all about status, titles and power plays. Instead, get ready to engage your heart and mind as you go on a journey to discover how the most courageous leaders think, feel and behave. You’ll look at what concepts such as trust, honesty and failure can tell you about daring leadership, and challenge conventional wisdom about how the most successful among us operate. You’ll also discover the impact of your values, emotions and interpersonal relationships on your effectiveness as a leader. Finally, you’ll learn why, in a competitive and hostile working culture, you nonetheless need to let yourselves be vulnerable if you want to get ahead. In these blinks, you’ll discover what skydiving can teach you about leadership skills; why vulnerability leads to innovation; and why bravery and perfectionism don’t mix. What makes you feel vulnerable? The author has posed this question to thousands of individuals over the years, garnering responses that will probably sound familiar. Vulnerability is the first date after your difficult divorce, starting to run your first business or how you feel when you get laid off from work. In fact, vulnerability is a universal human emotion that we feel when we expose ourselves to others and during times of risk or uncertainty. Nonetheless, despite being such a common feeling, there are some damaging myths surrounding vulnerability, particularly that it equals weakness. Experiences that make you feel vulnerable, like losing a job or putting yourself out there emotionally, can bring feelings of anxiety, uncertainty and a desire for self-protection. However, there is not a single piece of empirical data to suggest that vulnerability is associated with weakness. In fact, the opposite is true: acts of courage are impossible without first putting yourself in a vulnerable position. Not convinced? Just consider the question that the author put to a room of special forces military personnel in 2014. After explaining that vulnerability is the emotion that accompanies risk and uncertainty, the author then asked these brave, tough soldiers whether any of them had ever undertaken or witnessed a courageous act that did not require them to feel vulnerable. Unsurprisingly, none of the soldiers could come up with a single example of courageousness in which vulnerability hadn’t come along for the ride. In other words, as soon as the audience focused on their actual experiences of being courageous, the myth of vulnerability and weakness crumbled. And vulnerability isn’t just essential to courage. In fact, it is the cornerstone of human innovation and creativity. Why? Because there is so much uncertainty inherent to the creative process that successful innovation usually requires a healthy dose of failure along the way. On a cultural level, this means that a society that equates vulnerability with weakness is likely to struggle to produce new ideas or fresh perspectives - although some individuals will inevitably go against the grain. As Golden Globe-winning actress and writer Amy Poehler points out, it’s very difficult to let yourself be vulnerable, and those who can are often society’s dreamers, thinkers and creators. Sometimes, the truth hurts. In the early days of starting her own company, the author’s employees asked if they could sit down with her and discuss some concerns they had. Stunned, the author listened as her employees relayed how bad they thought she was at time management and pointed out her habit of setting unrealistic deadlines that they often struggled to meet. Although their criticisms were hard to hear, the author was grateful for her team’s honest feedback. Why? Because she believes that being clear is being kind, and that it’s unkind to be unclear. Indeed, entering into all communication with a spirit of clarity and honesty, both at home and in the workplace, is a simple yet transformative step that all leaders should take. Unfortunately, research has shown that the majority of us sidestep clarity in our daily interactions because we feel it's kinder to do so. But is it really? We may tell ourselves that we feed people half-truths to make them feel good, but often we’re really avoiding honest and confrontational conversations because they make us uncomfortable. Clear communication would be far kinder and more productive in the long run. After all, if you fail to be clear about your expectations for a subordinate simply because doing so is difficult, you’ll likely just end up blaming them for failing to deliver further down the line. One of the most important things the author has learned from years of studying leadership is that leaders need to spend a significant amount of time communicating about their subordinates’ feelings and fears. If they fail to do this, they can expect to spend even more time attempting to manage their workforce’s unproductive and ineffective behavior. Importantly, leaders can solicit clearer feedback from subordinates by really listening to them. Once you ask someone about their true feelings, leave a lot of empty space and drawn-out pauses in the conversation. In other words, try to stop talking. This may feel uncomfortable, but have faith that, when they’re ready, the other person will fill the silences with their true thoughts. When they do begin talking, try not to start mentally formulating a response right away. Instead, concentrate on listening to their concerns. Just remember that they are being kind enough to be clear with you – return the favor by really listening to them. The modern workplace can often feel like a gladiatorial arena – a battle for supremacy that, while not a matter of life and death, still requires bravery and plenty of blood, sweat and tears. During moments of struggle, whether at work or in our personal lives, it’s tempting to throw up our hands and exit the arena. How can we find the strength to keep going? Importantly, when we find ourselves face down in the dirt, it’s our values that motivate us to get back up again and keep daring to give it our all. Our values inform our judgments about what is most important in our lives. The most courageous leaders that the author came across during her research were those who had the most clarity about what their values were. During times of uncertainty and vulnerability, their values were an important support to them, a ‘North Star’ that helped guide them through periods of darkness. They were more willing to take risks, secure in the knowledge that their values would guide them through without compromising their integrity. Knowing what was most important to them was vital to their ability to be daring leaders. So take the time to ask yourself: What are your key values? Making a list of things that are highly important to us might be a straightforward exercise. When we whittle our list down to just two things, though, it really becomes useful. The author, for example, narrowed hers down to the key values of courage and faith. Why two? The author’s research, derived from hundreds of interviews with global executive leaders, has found that most leaders identify ten or more core values. The leaders most willing to experience vulnerability and demonstrate courage, on the other hand, anchored themselves to no more than two. It makes a lot of sense - two values are actionable. But if every single value on the less daring leaders’ long lists is highly important to them, then none are truly driving their behavior. Consequently, their values become a meaningless list of words that make them feel good. To avoid falling into the same trap, we can name our two most important values, let them guide our behavior and hold them close when times get tough. How trustworthy are we, and how many people do we truly trust? Astonishingly, most people report that they themselves are entirely trustworthy, but that they trust only a small number of other colleagues. It seems that most of us have some trust issues to work on. First, though, we need to ask ourselves: What does the concept of trust actually mean? The author’s team of researchers has pinpointed seven separate behaviors that encourage trust, expressed together with the acronym BRAVING. BRAVING can be a useful way to inventory strengths and areas for improvement in working relationships with subordinates. So, what are these behaviors? The B stands for boundaries. This element of trust involves respecting others’ boundaries. If either party is unsure of the other’s boundaries, they ask whether or not something is okay, and the other person feels comfortable enough to say no if it isn’t. The R stands for reliability, or doing what we say we will. In a work context, this translates into being aware of our abilities and limitations so that we don’t end up overpromising and under-delivering on commitments. The A stands for accountability. We take ownership of our mistakes, apologize for them and try our best to make amends. The V stands for vault. We can think of ourselves as a vault of information that other people have shared with us over time. An important aspect of trust is not passing on information that is not ours to pass on. Other people need to trust that we will keep their confidences and also need to see that we are not sharing other’s confidential information with them. The I stands for integrity - choosing courage instead of comfort, and doing what is right rather than what is easy, fun or expedient. It also means practicing the same values that we preach. The N stands for non-judgment, which means people know that they can tell us how they really feel or ask for help without expecting us to judge them for doing so. The G stands for generosity, being consistently generous in our interpretation of the words, actions and intentions of others. People are more likely to trust us if they know we always see the best in others, rather than the worst. Implement these behaviors to become a successful, trustworthy leader. Believe it or not, business leaders could learn a lot from skydivers. Before aspiring skydivers are allowed to hit the skies, they spend numerous training sessions learning how to hit the ground safely by simply jumping off ladders. The lesson for leaders? If you’re going to be brave, then it’s best to prepare yourself for bumpy landings. In other words, you need to learn how to be resilient. Unsurprisingly, things are done differently in business than in skydiving. Leaders and leadership coaches are usually aware of the need for resilience training, but these skills are usually taught only after a failure or crisis has already happened. It’s comparable to teaching newbie skydivers the right way to hit the ground after they’ve already landed, or worse, when they’re already in free-fall. But there is a better way. Research has shown that when it comes to teaching leaders resilience skills, timing is everything. Specifically, teaching them early on as part of a wider training program is more likely to result in them demonstrating courageous behaviors. Why? Quite simply, they are confident in their ability to get back up again if their daring behavior doesn’t pay off. So companies that fail to instill these resilience skills in their workforce are effectively deterring their leaders, both present and future, from bravery. Some organizations may worry that teaching leaders how to fail from the get-go promotes a culture of low expectations. In fact, the opposite is true. For instance, in the author’s own company she makes it a priority to teach failing and resilience skills as part of the onboarding process for new recruits. It’s the company’s way of telling new joiners that bravery is expected, thus failure is also expected once in a while. Interestingly, this emphasis on resilience is nothing new. You may well have seen company slogans urging you to “fall forward” and “fail fast!” But without a resilience skills program to back them up, implemented at an early stage in a leader’s development, these slogans can do more harm than good. Why? Because leaders who fail without the resilience skills to cope quickly find themselves dealing with a double dose of shame – the shame of the initial failure quickly followed by the shame of struggling to pick themselves up again despite all the shouty motivational slogans urging them to learn and move on. Right from childhood, we seek to shield ourselves from vulnerable feelings like disappointment, hurt and diminishment. By building a wall out of our behaviors, emotions and thoughts, we protect ourselves from the big bad world. But to live and lead with courage, as we already know, we must let ourselves be vulnerable. This means letting down our walls and recognizing protective thoughts and behaviors for the defense mechanisms they really are. One of the most pervasive types of self-protection is perfectionism. To become daring leaders, we must rid ourselves of perfectionism. To do so, let’s start by busting some of the myths around this damaging phenomenon. Perhaps the most damaging myth of all is that perfectionism is about self-improvement and striving for excellence. But in fact, perfectionism is really about attempting to win approval. Most perfectionists are raised in environments that praise their exceptional performance, for example in athletics or school. As a result, perfectionists develop a damaging belief system that follows them into their adult lives, anchoring their whole sense of self in accomplishments and brilliant execution. This locks perfectionists into an exhausting behavioral pattern of pleasing people, perfecting efforts, performing for others and proving themselves. People with a healthy drive for success, on the other hand, are much more self-focused and inspired by asking themselves how they can improve. It’s a stark contrast with perfectionists, who ask ‘what might others think of me?’ Significantly, leaders who armor themselves with perfectionism often assume that this way of thinking will bring them success. They couldn’t be more wrong because there is a much darker side to perfectionism, going way beyond the need to please. Disturbingly, research shows that perfectionism is associated with addiction, depression and anxiety. Furthermore, perfectionists are more likely to miss opportunities and experience mental paralysis that keeps them from fully engaging in life. Why? Because their fears of being criticized or not meeting the expectations of others keeps them from entering the messy arena of life, where healthy competition and striving for true greatness occur. To become a daring leader, take off the armor of perfectionism and jump into the fray of life. You might make mistakes in the process, but you’ll gain something valuable in exchange: the courage to succeed and lead. The key message in these blinks: When we open ourselves up to vulnerability, we open ourselves up to courage and creativity. When we let go of our perfectionist tendencies and our fear of failure, we find the bravery to improve ourselves and to have difficult, important conversations with our colleagues. In other words, we need all of our emotions on board if we’re going to become daring leaders.  Actionable advice: Explore your feelings instead of numbing them. Our knee-jerk response when experiencing vulnerability is often to try to make it go away. We usually numb ourselves, with whatever we have at hand - whether it’s alcohol, comfort eating or shopping. But before you dive into that big glass of wine or tub of ice cream, ask yourself: What is it I’m actually feeling, and where has this feeling come from? Once you’ve identified the real problem, you can work out what will bring you real comfort and relief from it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Even if you’ve got it all – a high income, the perfect house, a loving family and your dream car parked in the driveway – things can sometimes just feel off. Maybe the job you once adored has become dreary beyond description, or your old passions just don’t do it for you anymore. If that sounds familiar, you’ve probably been drifting through life for a while now. That’s hardly surprising – between work and personal commitments, there just isn’t much time to really think about what it is you want to be doing. Then there are those niggling worries that hold you back. Sure, it’d be nice to ditch the old nine-to-five in favor of something more fulfilling, but that’s never going to pay the bills, right? Well, according to life coach Dominick Quartuccio, it just might! The key is to develop a new can-do mindset, and start being proactive about getting the most out of your life – think of it as designing the future you’ve always wanted. Change can be painful, but it is possible. And, as you’ll learn in these blinks, there are a ton of tools out there to help you along the way. Read on to find out: how meditation can set you up for success; why it’s better to focus on one goal at a time; and how to break out of old habits and patterns. Even the most successful people are often deeply unsatisfied. Although they can’t quite put their finger on why they feel that way, they’re frustrated and bored. Something just isn’t right. Why? Well, there’s a good chance that their lives have become overly predictable. That’s an issue because predictability is a trap. Here’s how it works: you find yourself a well-paid job, get married, have kids and settle down. Soon enough, you realize your time is being swallowed whole by your career and family commitments. Every day has its set pattern and familiar chores – tasks you know so well that you’re basically cruising through them on autopilot. If you’re a high achiever or have an ambitious personality, this can be a killer. After all, you’re at your best when you’re working on exciting new challenges or experimenting with novel ideas. But all your commitments have you on a treadmill – you’re always running but not getting anywhere. By the end of the day, you’re exhausted and ready to collapse on the sofa in front of yet another Netflix series. In the morning, you’ve recharged your batteries just enough to start all over again. So why do so many people end up in this trap? Well, that’s where limiting beliefs come in. If you want to know what those are, just think of all the “should” sentences you’ve told yourself over the years: “I should get a reliable, safe job,” say, or “I should have another child” and “I should put other people’s needs above my own.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever be happy if you’re pursuing them because you think society expects you to! Then there’s the notion that you can turn a bad situation around, that is, do more of the thing that’s making you miserable. It sounds crazy, but plenty of folks end up doubling down on a job they loathe, believing that the next pay rise or promotion will finally give them the life they’ve always dreamed of. But that rarely works out; if you’re not doing something you’re passionate about, chances are it’s never going to be fulfilling. So how do you get yourself out of this trap? In a word, change. And that’s what we’ll be looking at in the next blink. The worst thing about being stuck in a soul-crushing cycle of predictability is how hard it is to break out of it. In fact, people often only take decisive action when fate forces their hand, for example, when they’re laid off or get sick. So what stops us from making those all-important changes? It’s usually fear that keeps us locked into the status quo. Nothing scares us more than the unknown – as the saying goes, “better the devil you know.” Sure, things might suck right now, but what if they got worse? Then there’s the fact that change can be difficult, even if it’s ultimately for the best. Just think of something as simple as changing your cable provider: even if the present one drives you up the wall, buying, installing and acclimatizing to a new setup is a pain. The other great obstacle that stops us from transforming our lives is the nagging worry that we’ll buckle under the emotional strain that comes with big changes. The problem here, though, is that we fail to understand just how great an emotional burden the status quo is. Change can be painful, but it hurts a whole lot less than staying in a miserable relationship or working at a job you loathe. This leaves us with the million-dollar question: How do you start shaking things up and improving your life? The good news is, it’s simpler than you might think. All it takes are three steps – the author calls them awakening, disrupting and designing. Awakening is all about mindfulness. Taking a step back to observe yourself, and your behavior, allows you to start recognizing the patterns and habits that keep you on that treadmill. And becoming aware of the things that make you unhappy is the first step to changing them. That brings us to disruption. Here you’ll want to experiment with breaking out of negative cycles. Say you overeat – dropping that habit for a bit is a great chance to get in touch with what’s motivating your behavior. Perhaps you overindulge when you’re stressed, or maybe there are other feelings at play. Finally, there’s designing: creating a new, positive routine that helps you live the life you’ve always dreamed of. We’ll be exploring this in greater detail in the following blinks. We’ve seen that fear often holds us back from making changes, but why? After all, we all know that getting fired or losing a partner are possibilities even if we stick with the status quo – some things just aren’t within our control. That suggests that the real obstacle isn’t a rational calculation of possible outcomes, but our inability to imagine and connect with our future selves. Take the work of economist Hal Hershfield at the UCLA School of Management. His research uses MRI scans to look at people’s brain activity when they think about the future. When Hershfield asked subjects to picture themselves three to five years from now, their brains reacted as if they were thinking about a complete stranger. That goes a long way toward explaining why it can be hard getting out of a dead-end job you hate – it’s virtually impossible to picture what another half decade in your current position will do to you! That’s why it’s so important to learn to connect with your future self if you want to make positive changes in the here and now. So, how does that work? A good starting point is visualization. Take it from Chris, one of the author’s clients. Chris was working as a salesman for a company selling medical appliances. He regularly clocked up 12-hour shifts, six days a week. He was miserable, but couldn’t figure out how to improve his situation. The author asked Chris to imagine how he’d feel three years down the line. How motivated would he be? How would his relationships fare? More concretely, what did Chris think he’d look like? As a picture of his future self came into focus, Chris got scared – it wasn’t a pretty sight. And that was the point of the exercise: by visualizing his future self, Chris realized that making changes now would ultimately be a lot less painful than sticking to his current path in life. The result? He quit his job and went out in search of a new vocation! Meditation might just be the most powerful tool there is for improving your life. Why? Well, it’s a key part of the awakening process we’ve already mentioned. In this blink, we’ll take a closer look at how it works. One of the reasons we end up feeling stuck in the present status quo is habit: we’re basically running on autopilot when we going through our daily chores. That’s where meditation comes it. The practice is all about creating a gap between stimulus and response, and learning to observe thoughts dispassionately without immediately reacting to them. Over time, this puts the brakes on automatic behavior. Rather than jumping out of bed when the alarm rings and sleepwalking your way into the office, you’ll find yourself pausing and asking “Is this what I really want to be doing?” And this is the first step toward making those all-important changes. Getting to that point, however, takes time and perseverance. Take it from the author. He first realized that he’d much rather be an inspirational life coach and speaker than a corporate employee while meditating. When that thought initially arose, a habitual response kicked in and he repressed the idea by telling himself he’d never make enough money doing his dream job. After a further six months of regular meditation, the same thought came up again. By this stage, the author had deepened his meditative practices to such an extent that those old money-based fears didn’t have nearly as much power over him as they used to. Rather than dwelling on his anxieties, he focused on the excitement he felt when he contemplated his new career path. The rest is history: the author quit his dreary day job and decided to become a life coach. All it took was some time out to reflect on his life and true desires! Sometimes all you want to do when you’ve had a long day at the office is relax on the sofa with a glass of wine and zone out in front of the TV. While that can be relaxing and fun, it’s often little more than a waste of time. So how do you position yourself to do something more rewarding with those precious after-work evenings and weekends? Well, the key is to disrupt ingrained habits. It’s not about giving up everything you enjoy doing, but rather developing a healthier relationship with things like entertainment or alcohol. So why not challenge yourself to go a hundred days without drinking, or abstaining from TV and Netflix for the next three months? If you’re hopelessly addicted to your smartphone, you could try declaring your home a cell phone-free zone for two weeks. The point of these kinds of commitments is to break away from compulsive behavior, and learn to only do things when you actually want to do them. So, rather than automatically logging into your social media account or heading to the fridge for a beer when you get home, make a mindful choice about what the most rewarding use of your time would be. Taking a break from your habits will make that much easier: by the end of your voluntary abstinence, you’ll be much better placed to compare what you missed about your old habits with what you gained by doing something else. Another great way to positively disrupt your life is to be choosy when it comes to your social circle. We live in an age of unprecedented connectivity. That means we’re always connected, and could theoretically create dozens of new relationships every week. In reality, that’d be a nightmare: just imagine all the effort it’d take to keep them going! It might sound harsh, but your best bet is to select a small number of key relationships that inspire you or are deeply meaningful to you, and then weed out the rest. If you’re just seeing friends out of politeness, but don’t really have anything to say to them, it’s time to move on! High achievers have hundreds of goals, but very little time and extra energy to pursue them all. So what do you do if you want to learn Japanese, tone your abs and get that promotion you’ve been angling for? Well, you’re much more likely to succeed if you focus on one target at a time. Sounds pretty commonsensical, right? But here’s the rub: it’s so obvious a notion that lots of strivers and go-getters end up overlooking it. That’s something the author has seen in his clients time and time again. Ambitious people often pursue multiple projects at the same time, spread themselves too thin and end up feeling frustrated by their lack of progress. That’s hardly surprising – after all, sustaining a commitment is much harder than taking it on in the first place. Just think of relationships. In the early days of a budding romance, spontaneity and going with the flow is all it takes to keep things on track. Maintaining a long-term relationship, by contrast, requires a huge amount of time, dedication and work. So it stands to reason that focusing on one goal at a time is the best strategy if you want to see your projects through to completion. And that’s all about your mentality. Starting with a goal that’s relatively easy to achieve – getting home early one day a week to spend more time with your family, say – will increase your chances of success. That’s important, because you’ll want to reinforce your experience of setting and meeting targets. It’s also important to be clear about why you’re pursuing your goals. If your aim is to lose thirty pounds over the next three months, you’ll need to have an outcome in mind that’ll really keep you motivated. Simply being able to squeeze into a pair of jeans that have become too tight just won’t cut it. Losing weight to give your sex life a boost, by contrast, should keep your motivation levels sky high! The sense that you’re simply drifting through life without really accomplishing anything is a huge source of anxiety. That said, focusing your efforts and actually completing things that matter to you isn’t easy, especially if you’ve got a million other commitments. Luckily, there a couple of tools you can start using today to help you. Let’s start with scorecards. A scorecard is essentially a list of things you want to achieve within a certain timeframe. Simply ticking them off as you work through your targets is a great visualization of your progress, which is bound to inspire you to keep going. Take it from the author. He set himself three targets for a 90-day period: avoid TV, skip dessert and get a full eight hours of sleep each night. As the crosses on his scorecard gradually accumulated, he began to feel more and more confident about his ability to stick to his guns and reach his goals. The best thing about this system is that it helps you put occasional lapses into perspective. Caved in and spent the evening binge-watching a new series on Netflix? Just compare it to all those nights that you didn’t! That’s a great reminder of how well you’re doing, and should strengthen your resolve rather than letting a bad day throw you off course. And here’s another top tip: make your mornings and evenings meaningful by creating rituals that set you up for the day ahead, or prepare you for a full night’s rest. How? Well, start by paying close attention to how you spend these precious hours. If you find that you’re writing e-mails and scrolling through your Facebook feed before you’re even out of bed, why not aim to do something more fulfilling, such as working out? Evenings are just as important – after all, if you’re not getting enough rest, it’s likely to have a massive impact on your physical and mental health. So cut out distractions, and try spending a few minutes meditating and clearing your mind before bedtime. Chances are, you’ll sleep a whole lot better! In 2010, Facebook employees spray-painted one of the company’s core beliefs on the walls of its headquarters: “Done is better than perfect.” That’s an idea all high achievers should take to heart – after all, the desire to do things perfectly all too often gets in the way of getting anything done at all! That’s a bitter pill to swallow if you’re the go-getter type. Chances are, you’re all about 120 percent motivation, inspiration and success at all times. But here’s the thing: that’s just not realistic. There’ll be days when you’ll feel tired, overwhelmed or out of your depth, and simply incapable of knocking it out of the park. That shouldn’t distract you from an important truth, however – even if you’re “only” hitting 75, 50 or even 25 percent of your daily targets, you’re still that much closer to your goal. Say you’ve decided to meditate for 30 minutes twice a day. That’s pretty ambitious, and it’s likely you won’t always manage to find the time to fulfill that ambition. The key is to persevere, and remember not to give up even on those occasional off days. Scaling things back and aiming to get in 20 minutes of meditation each day will allow you to keep your momentum going and achieve your goal, even if it takes a little longer than you initially thought it might. The key is to remember that, in the end, even the smallest steps add up. In fact, if you keep chalking up little victories every day, you’re pretty much guaranteed to reach a tipping point and find yourself achieving your biggest dreams. Think of writing a book. When you first sit down in front of an empty page, it seems like the most daunting thing in the world. But now imagine writing just 500 words a day. That sounds pretty manageable, right? Do that for 90 days and you’ll have produced 45,000 words – that’s a pretty decent size for a first book! Anything is possible when you embrace the right mindset. As we’ve seen in these blinks, that’s often about nothing more than making small tweaks to your outlook. But the most important step on your journey is the first one: the decision to smash the status quo, disrupt your life and start pushing for the things that really matter to you! The key message in these blinks: It’s easy to get stuck in a safe, predictable routine built around a reliable job and a plodding family life. That, however, is a nightmare if you’re a high achiever – what you need are challenges, change and excitement. So what’s stopping you from shaking things up? Well, it’s usually fears about money, status and what society says you should be doing. Learn to face down those anxieties, and the world is your oyster. Luckily, there are plenty of tools you can use to help you do just that. Whether it’s crafting new daily routines, keeping a scorecard to track your achievements or meditating, the hacks in these blinks will help you unlock your hidden potential.  Actionable advice: Finish what you start.  There’s nothing more exciting than throwing yourself into a new project that you love. But the truth is, that feeling will gradually wane: at some point on your journey, you’ll begin to tire and think of giving up. It’s in those moments that you need to remember how you felt at the outset. Reconnecting with that early enthusiasm will remind you that you’re doing something that is deeply meaningful and important to you. So keep going until you achieve that big result – best of all, it’ll give you much more motivation and happiness to sustain you through your next project! Got feedback?

Or maybe you’ve stopped and marveled at the design of your smartphone? If so, then you’ve experienced the bliss of quality design. Now, let’s imagine that you could tinker with and fine-tune your life so that it, too, was perfectly designed. Just as designers solve everyday problems by creating new things, so can you too address the problems in your life by focusing on its design. Designers have tools and training at their disposal to help them in their work, and these blinks aim to give you the tools and training that will allow you to build a life that brings continuous joy. You’ll also find out what the four most important parts of life are and how you balance them; how coherency between your beliefs and what you do will give you a compass for life; and why you want to design several different types of life. If you feel completely content with your personal and professional life, then consider yourself lucky. Most people are unhappy with at least some aspects of their life. For instance, many people worry that they’ve chosen the wrong profession. In a poll of US workers, two-thirds of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction with their job, some of them saying they feel trapped because their diploma is in a field they’d rather not be in. They have a degree in civil engineering, for instance, and feel doomed to pursue a career in this field that they never really enjoyed in the first place. Indeed, around 31 million Americans between the ages of 44 and 70 would choose a different encore career if they could, one that gives them a sense of personal meaning and societal impact, as well as a steady paycheck, but they see no way of getting there. With all these unsatisfied workers, what we need is a new way of designing our lives to meet our needs and desires. A degree shouldn’t limit your options. After all, three-fourths of US college graduates end up in a field that has nothing to do with the subject they majored in. You may have chosen to get a certain degree, but it needn’t determine your future. Whatever your age, background or profession, thinking like a designer and creating a well-designed life can bring you more satisfaction and joy. A well-designed life is one that allows you to be creative, happy and fulfilled. It helps you to avoid feeling stuck and unproductive while providing you with a sense of freedom – freedom to change and grow, in both your personal and professional life – no matter how old you are. Everything around you is designed: your house or apartment, the chair you sit on and the computers and devices you use. So why not design your life, too? If you’re trying to get directions from Google Maps, you need to know more than just the destination; you also need to know your current location. The same is true when you start designing your life. The first step to figuring out your current situation is to assess four critical areas in your life: health, work, play and love. Health includes your emotional, mental and physical health. Work includes both paid and volunteer jobs. Play is any activity done simply for the fun of it. And love applies to partners, children, friends and pets. The goal is to find a healthy balance among all four of these areas, and the precise balance is totally up to you. Someone young will likely give more importance to play, while an elderly person might focus more on health. After you’ve taken stock of these areas, it should become apparent to you if one is being neglected. For example, maybe you’re too focused on work, and it has caused both your health and your love life to suffer? Or maybe you’ve been too immersed in play and have neglected your career aspirations? Once you’ve made this assessment, it’s time to assume a beginner’s mind and start asking the questions a complete novice would. A beginner’s mind is a great perspective to have whenever you’re facing a life-changing decision, such as which career to choose. Let’s say you’re interested in studying marine biology because you love seals. Before you make the decision to start applying to colleges, approach the situation like a beginner and ask yourself basic questions like “What is the life of a marine biologist really like?” and “How much of it really involves seals?” This will help you find the right direction. Maybe you should do some volunteer work on a research vessel to get a better idea of what the day to day is really like? If you approach situations with a beginner’s mind and ask the right questions, you’ll reduce the risk of regretting your choices later down the line. A great many discoveries were made by explorers who had little more than a compass to guide them. When entering the great unknown of your future, you can use a compass as well. In this case, the two guiding poles of your life are your workview and your lifeview. Your workview is your own philosophy on work and what it means to you. Everyone has their own ideas about what “good work” entails and how important money and the societal impact are to their job satisfaction. Your idea of “good work” might be whatever earns enough to pay the bills, so long as you don’t have to work on weekends. Likewise, your lifeview is your philosophy on life, meaning your personal values and perspectives on how it should be lived. This view covers things like how important religion is in your life, how you think society should function and what you consider to be moral and just. Your lifeview might, for instance, place a lot of importance on the environment and lead you to live a self-sustainable life on a farm somewhere. When you start designing your life, reflect on these two areas and write down at least 250 words to accurately describe both. Try not to spend more than half an hour on each description. Now, the goal is to find a coherent balance between the beliefs in your lifeview and the kind of job your workview suggests; if you can manage this balance, your compass will be correctly aligned. Without the right balance, you’re bound to feel discontent and unhappy sooner or later, because you’ve compromised your beliefs, and therefore your integrity. If your lifeview says the planet must be treated with care, then you don’t want to take a job with a corporation that dumps chemicals into the ocean every day, right? And if your workview says that money and prestige are important to you, you need to choose a career that can realistically deliver those. By taking both views into consideration when designing your life, you should be able to stay on course and know when to adjust your route. Now that our compass is set let’s put it to use. With your compass in proper working order, let’s take a closer look at engagement. To live a joyful life, it’s important to know what engages and disengages you. And for this, a Good Time Journal can be an invaluable tool. This is a place to write down your experiences, in both good times and bad, and doing so will help you understand what brings joy to your life. Throughout each day, wherever you are, write down how engaged and focused you feel, also noting if you’re unhappy or bored. Also, jot down what you were doing at the time. One thing to make special note of is when you experience flow, where you become completely immersed in an activity and time seems to fly by. Maybe it happens when you’re researching a legal document or when you’re chopping carrots. Maybe you feel it when you play sports. It depends on you. If you ever emerge from being in the zone and are surprised by how much time has passed, be sure to make note of what you were doing. These moments are a great indicator of your engagement, and you should keep them in mind when designing both your career and your life. Another clue to help you find your way in life are your energy levels. Every day involves both physical and mental work, but some activities take a bigger toll than others. And some activities can even raise your energy levels. Use your Good Time Journal to keep track of which activities drain your energy and which ones help to sustain it. If you feel completely drained after sitting in meetings or doing data entry, but feel energized after pitching products to a potential customer, make a note of it. Understanding how to stay energized and make the most of your day will be useful information for designing your life. In the next blink, we’ll look at what to do when your life has you feeling neither engaged nor energized, just stuck. At one time or another, most of us have felt stuck. Just consider the story of Grant, who was working at a car-rental company. Even though he had recently been offered a promotion, he still loathed having to deal with angry customers and boring contracts. He felt like a mere cog in the corporate machine with nothing to keep him engaged or energized. Like a lot of people who don’t like their jobs, Grant looked to the weekend for engagement. He enjoyed hiking and playing basketball, but these energizing activities couldn’t pay the bills. In college, he’d studied literature, but he’d felt the need to jump at the first decent paying job he found, which is how he got stuck in the car-rental business. Eventually, Grant got unstuck, after he did some mind mapping. Because he knew he enjoyed doing things outdoors, Grant picked “outdoor activities” as his starting point and wrote this in the center of a sheet of paper. He began to free associate and jot down what popped into his head, like “hiking,” “surfing” and “travel.” For each of these, he made secondary associations. For hiking, it was “mountains” and “exploring”; for “travel” he wrote down “Hawaii” and “tropical beach.” Now Grant could start to put these ideas together into a plan. He thought about accepting the promotion the company had offered, but only if he could relocate to another office where he could surf and enjoy the beaches, such as California or Hawaii. This is how mind mapping works. It allows you to open your mind to new ideas that you otherwise might not have thought of. With just a pen and paper you can begin to find your new path.  Most of us have regrets from time to time. If only I’d played that one situation slightly differently, we think, everything would be better today! But the truth is, there’s no single, specific choice that will lead to a perfect life. In fact, there isn’t a single best or perfect way to live a life, period. Throughout your life, you’ll have many options to choose from, even if they aren’t always apparent. This is why it’s important to think ahead and plan, or design, many possible lives for yourself – not just one. Consider the story of Chung: when he graduated from UC Berkeley, he was offered four different internships, three of which were ones he’d hoped to receive. But he hadn’t expected to be in the position to choose among three great opportunities. At first, he felt immense pressure to choose the right path. After all, this would likely influence his choice of graduate degree, his career and the rest of his life. But then it hit him: there’s nothing stopping him from doing all three one after the other – which is exactly what he chose to do. But then came another twist: while doing his first internship, Chung spent a lot of time talking to his friends via Skype. He was so pleased with his decision to do all three internships that he felt motivated to help them with their career choices, too. In the end, he realized he enjoyed this so much that he skipped the other internships and began studying career counseling in grad school. You can do a similar thing by charting three different paths, which the author calls odyssey plans. Life is an odyssey, with a variety of possible routes and circumstances, so it’s wise to give yourself at least three options. But don’t rank them from worst to best. Instead, have an open mind and look at them as three equal, and equally possible, plans. An example of three equal plans could be, for instance, becoming an ecological farmer, journalist or kibbutz volunteer. At the Stanford Graduate School of Education, professor Dan Schwartz and his colleagues have observed that people who have multiple ideas from the get-go as to how to solve a problem are more likely to come up with innovative solutions than people who start out with just one idea. So don’t settle for a single path. Keep an open mind! This way, if your first choice doesn’t work out, you won’t panic about not having a perfectly viable plan B to turn to. The key message in this book: You can be the designer of your own life. First, focus on your current situation, and the balance of work, health, play and love in your life. Then understand your workview and lifeview. Next, do some mind mapping to figure out three solid options of where you want to go. Actionable advice: Stuff keywords into your CV. If you discover that you’re in the wrong line of work and decide to look for a new job, you should be aware that many companies often just automatically scan incoming CVs for certain keywords like a “Phd,” “creative” or “motivated”. Therefore, to ensure that your CV gets to the top of the pile that actual humans look at, you should stuff as many of those keywords into your CV as possible. Look at the job description for guidance as to which ones to include. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

When this click of approval debuted in 2007, on the long-forgotten social feed aggregator FriendFeed, it was only a matter of time before it became a standard feature on every social media platform to come. After all, this simple feature, and the endless notifications it generates, is a great way to collect data on our preferences and behaviors, and to keep users hooked. It’s no wonder people are finally starting to push back against social media and recognize that these technologies may be doing more harm than good. Indeed, a steady output of research has been opening our eyes to the many negative effects related to social media and smartphones. In this book, professor Cal Newport conducted his own experiment. 1,600 volunteers followed his guidelines for a month-long technological sabbatical, providing him with valuable feedback. The result of this study is digital minimalism: a way to step back from the onslaught of digital distractions and find a more satisfying and rewarding way of life. In these blinks, you’ll find out how social media is like big tobacco; how the Amish can help you to better use your smartphone; and how your attention became more valuable than oil. In 2016, New York magazine ran an article by the popular writer Andrew Sullivan. In 7,000 words, the author described how the constant onslaught of news, images and online babble finally “broke” him. There’s a good chance you’re familiar with the symptoms of what Sullivan was writing about – the constant urge to take out your smartphone and check your texts, email or social media feeds, the strange dull sensation of a moment when you’re not using digital media. How did we end up here? One important thing to realize is that the technology at the center of this problem was never intended to be used in the way it is now. When the first smartphone, the iPhone, debuted in 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the device as “the best iPod ever.” It was a cool way for you to make phone calls and also listen to your music. According to Andy Grignon, an Apple engineer on the first iPhone project, Jobs dismissed the idea of the iPhone becoming a platform for third-party apps and gaming. As for Facebook, it’s well known that in 2004 Facebook was considered a clever novelty – a way to find out more about a friend of a friend – not a major source of news or even a popular time waster. For most college students in 2004, the computer strategy game Snood was far more popular than Facebook. So, when people first brought iPhones and Facebook into their lives, they weren’t signing up for something they would spend hours every day looking at. This dangerous and addictive side to technology is something that’s crept up on us, thanks to the very intentional work of social media engineers. In a 2017 episode of the HBO talk show Real Time, Bill Maher referred to the “social media tycoons” as being the new big tobacco, selling products designed to be as addictive as possible. Indeed, much has been written about the tactics used to get and keep our attention, including the way some tech companies take advantage of the natural human desire for social approval. One of the most significant developments took place in 2009 when Facebook introduced the thumbs up button, a variant of FriendFeed’s “like” button. Now, when someone posted something, it became a deeply interactive experience. How many people in my tribe would like what I posted? There was a primal urge to keep checking in and we have become finely attuned to the notification sounds accompanying these responses. If we hope to protect ourselves against the bright minds of Silicon Valley, eager to exploit our vulnerabilities, we need a strong defense. This is why the author, Cal Newport, proposes a lifestyle he calls digital minimalism. There are plenty of people recommending quick fixes like simply disabling the notifications on your smartphone, but Newport doesn’t trust these little adjustments to make much difference in the long run. After all, the author of one such article said he disabled the notifications on 112 apps, which begs the question, do you really need that many apps in the first place? Cue digital minimalism, which is about the time-honored philosophy that better living can come from less. The name is purposefully similar to the minimalist lifestyle promoted by people like author Marie Kondo, who propose only letting things into your life that bring joy. Newport is applying this to the apps and digital media you take in, suggesting that you ask: Does this website, app or service really support what I value in a way that nothing else can? Digital minimalism takes a further step in asking you to optimize this technology in a way to maximize the value while reducing the cost to your time and energy. So, if Twitter is something that your career clearly benefits from, you can use it wisely by setting purposeful rules around it that allow you to go in, do what needs to be done and get out. Tyler was one of the 1,600 people that signed up for the author’s experiment with digital minimalism. He’d signed up to a few social media platforms because he valued staying connected to friends, entertainment and networking. But following the principles of digital minimalism, he realized that the benefits of social media were actually small compared to the time it cost him. Tyler closed his social media accounts, and a year later, he’s still thrilled with the change digital minimalism has brought to his life. He’s getting more exercise, reading more books, volunteering and learning to play music. Even with all this, he has more time to spend with his family and feels more focused at work. Tyler knows people who say they can’t quit social media, but at this point, he can’t see any reason to continue using it. Digital minimalism is based on three principles – clutter is costly, optimization is important and intentionality is satisfying. The first principle relates to the New Economics famously promoted by Henry David Thoreau in his book Walden. Basically, New Economics includes life costs when calculating what something is really worth. For instance, if you want to buy a car to drive into town instead of walking, Thoreau would remind you that the price you pay for the car isn’t its only cost, it’s also the time, stress and effort it takes to earn this money and to keep the car secure and in working order. In the end, the cost may far exceed the healthy act of walking into town. This same scrutiny should go into every bit of digital media you let into your life. Ask yourself what you are really gaining from it, and what the time and attention costs are. Are you sure you can’t perform the same task in a different way? The second principle relates to another economic hallmark. That is, the Law of Diminishing Returns, which explains why you can’t just keep adding stuff and expect continued improvements. For example, if you’re manufacturing cars, the first workers you add will increase your output. But you’ll eventually reach a point when the assembly line can’t handle anymore strain. Workers are bumping into each other, and things begin to slow down. Let’s say, instead of making cars, you want to stay informed about current events. Going from zero to two news sites will be a big improvement. But if you’re cramming a social media feed with dozens of different sources, it’s bound to become a never-ending, incomprehensible distraction. Instead of adding sources, you need to optimize your tools. For example, maybe the Instapaper app would work better than social media.

People often mistake the Amish for being anti-technology, but in reality, it’s not that simple. The Amish don’t reject technology without testing and questioning it first. Sometimes, as with a state-of-the-art milling machine, they’ll happily use it. However, if it doesn’t support their fundamental values of family and community, it’ll be banned. You should apply the same value-based approach to every tool you use. Does it really benefit and support your values and what you’re trying to do, or are you better off without it? If the principles of digital minimalism sound good, then the way to begin is to undergo thirty days of digital declutter. It’s important to recognize that this isn’t a digital detox period since a detox implies that you’ll return to your regular habits afterward. This period is about stopping what you’ve been doing in order to consider a new way forward. With this in mind, for thirty days, plan on cutting all non-essential technology from your life. This means anything that you don’t absolutely need to keep working and functioning on a day-to-day basis. At first, you might feel down when you realize how many addictive habits you’ve developed. But most of the people in Newport’s 1,600-person experiment reported that they soon forgot about their smartphone or whatever app they would reflexively open up. When identifying what is and isn’t essential, don’t confuse convenience for necessity. You may think you’ll irreparably damage a relationship if you quit Facebook. But you might find that without social media you’ll actually strengthen the relationship by calling the person, meeting them and speaking more often. The other task during this period is to look within and understand what’s really important to you. What are your interests, the things you value in life and enjoy doing outside of the world wide web? This is important because the next step is about finding something that will fill the void created by the absence of social media and new technology. After these thirty days, a carefully thought-out reintroduction period begins. This involves asking yourself three questions about any technology you’re considering keeping in your life. The first question is: Does this technology support something I deeply value? If so, move on to the second question: Is it the best way to support this value? Instagram may support the value of staying in touch with faraway relatives, but calling them on Skype every Sunday may be the far more meaningful way to do this. In fact, most people find that social media does not pass this screening process. But if something does pass the first two questions, it’s time for the final question: How can I use this tool in a way that maximizes its benefit and minimizes the harm it causes? A digital minimalist doesn’t just use or not use something. If they use Twitter, they probably don’t use it on their phone. They use it once or twice a week and only follow meaningful people they couldn’t otherwise connect with. The problem with a lot of “life hacks” and quick fixes is that they don’t set you up for sustainable change. They might prompt you to start a healthy new habit, but once you hit a snag or run into a problem, it’s all too easy to give up and say the fix didn’t stick. This is why digital minimalism has a variety of recommended practices that align with the lifestyle and are proven to have the kind of meaningful and rewarding value that is missing from a lot of digital-based activities. The first recommendation is solitude – a valuable commodity that new technology often takes away. If you were born before the mid-80s, you probably have clear memories of life before the smartphone. But people born between 1995 and 2012 essentially grew up with smartphones, and now spend an average of nine hours a day on these devices. World-renowned generational researcher Jean Twenge noticed a shocking uptick in psychological health issues with this group, dubbed the “iGen,” with a higher percentage of depression, suicide, eating disorders, homesickness and, above all, anxiety. Another term for what iGen is suffering from is solitude deprivation, a lack of time away from screens and input from outside sources, which is crucial for processing emotions, reflecting on relationships and what’s important in life, and giving the brain a chance to find some calm clarity. The silver lining is that solitude is easy to find. It can be experienced in a crowded cafe or subway train, just as long as you’re free to be with your thoughts and your thoughts alone. So the next time you go out, try leaving your phone at home. If you remember the days before smartphones, you know that this isn’t a dangerous or crazy thing to do. However, if you’re worried about an emergency, you can compromise by putting it in your glove compartment or somewhere where it isn’t readily accessible. Likewise, long walks are one classic source of solitude, with many of the great thinkers in history extolling its virtues. Thoreau was perhaps its greatest champion, but Arthur Rimbaud, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche also considered walking the inspiration for their best ideas. Of course, this is to be done without earbuds or a screen in sight. We’ve spent thousands of years developing a brain that has a complex network of neurons for the purpose of processing an intricate social life. It stands to reason that this brain would not be satisfied with emojis and hashtags. It may come as no surprise, then, that according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, the more time spent on social media, the more likely you are to feel lonely. So the next recommended digitally minimalist practice is to stop clicking “like.” In fact, don’t even leave any of those superficial comments like “so cool” or “love it.” Don’t fool yourself or anyone else into thinking these are meaningful human interactions or a valid alternative to a real conversation because they aren’t. Instead, stay silent and save your comments for the next time you call your friend or meet up with them for the kind of face-to-face conversation that we’re built to find satisfying. If you’re worried your friends will find this social media silence troubling, just tell them you’re stepping back from these kinds of interactions. And remember, if you visit a friend and bring some food with you, it will mean more than a hundred likes. The reality is that less social media equals a better social life. This is because you’ll be more prone to actually meet and talk to people. The same goes for texts, messaging and emails as well. An actual phone call is more rewarding to our social needs than any number of emojis. Of course, texts are extremely useful when you’re running late to a meeting or just need a quick confirmation. But when it becomes your standard means of communication, it can raise your level of loneliness. One Silicon Valley executive has come up with a pretty useful practice that you can start implementing, which is to set regular conversation hours. He tells everyone that any weekday at 5:30 p.m. you can call him and discuss anything. This is an effective way to discourage getting into a lengthy text-based back-and-forth, since he often writes back to say, let’s discuss this – just call any day at 5:30. This doesn’t just apply to phone calls, either. You can have a standing invitation to be joined at your favorite coffee shop on Saturday mornings at 11 AM, for instance. Whatever you prefer, just promote real conversations, and you’ll be happy you did. You shouldn’t underestimate the value of quality leisure time. As the legendary philosopher Aristotle pointed out, to live the good life, one must have the downtime needed for deep contemplation, for no other reason than to enjoy the activity itself. As Aristotle expert Kieran Setiya elaborates, activities that provide a “source of inward joy” are vital to a satisfying life. The author calls these activities high-quality leisure while calling digital distractions such as social media and absent-minded bingeing low-quality leisure. Therefore, one aim of digital minimalism is to make more room for the high-quality while purposefully limiting low-quality time. In looking at what exactly makes a high-quality activity, the author has found that hobbies requiring strenuous effort are often among the most rewarding. This may sound tiring at first, but as the influential British writer Arthur Bennett once noted, the more effort you put into your leisure activities, the more you’ll be rewarded with satisfaction and even come away feeling energized. Engaging physically with real, three-dimensional objects is also key, as Gary Rogowski points out in his book Craftsman. As such, poking your finger at a small screen is unlikely to ever be a truly satisfying or rewarding human endeavor. This is why one of the “leisure lessons” of digital minimalism is to engage with the physical world by applying skills and working to create things of value. And for this, technology can be a great aide. With the abundance of YouTube tutorials out there, you can easily spend a rewarding weekend either building your own wooden headboard or learning some basic techniques to become a weekend carpenter. You could also set leisure-time goals, like learning the guitar parts to five Beatles songs in time for a mini-concert at a friend’s Sunday barbeque in three weeks. Deadlines like this are great for keeping high-quality momentum going. To make sure you don’t succumb to the weekend-killing temptations of low-quality leisure, the best plan isn’t to go cold turkey, but rather to schedule these activities for specific times. Going cold turkey can easily backfire and result in a relapse of old behavioral patterns, so start by scheduling isolated chunks of low-quality time on evenings and weekends while you give the rest of your free-time over to high-quality activities. Chances are you’ll feel the difference in quality, and the digital distractions will gradually become less of a concern. With so many people glued to their smartphones and social media accounts, you may think of digital minimalism as an extreme and unusual idea. But the truth is, digital minimalism is just one part of a growing worldwide movement known as the Attention Resistance. This movement gets its name from the industry that many of today’s major tech businesses are in – the attention economy. Companies like Facebook make their money the same way tabloid newspapers did in the 1800s. They draw a big audience and then sell that audience’s attention to advertisers who pitch them their products and services. The more people they attract, and the longer they can keep their attention, the more money they get from advertisers. These days, getting attention is more valuable than getting oil, with Google valued at $800 billion, Facebook at $500 billion and ExxonMobile at $370 billion. With this much money at stake, companies in the attention economy are serious about exploiting human vulnerabilities and doing whatever it takes to keep you distracted. This is precisely why people have gotten serious about retaining their autonomy and resisting these tactics. One of the many effective methods used by the Attention Resistance is to dumb down your phone. So, if you see someone with a circa 2000 flip phone, this is likely a member of the Resistance who’s decided to remove themselves from the attention economy. Another method is to make your computer a single-purpose device, just like the earliest versions of Macs and PCs. You can do this by using popular blocking software like Freedom, which author Zadie Smith thanked by name in the acknowledgments of her 2012 bestseller NW. Now, some people think it’s heretical to revert your computer to a single-function machine like early versions of Macs and PCs as if you were purposefully making your computer less powerful. But whether you make your computer run programs simultaneously or not has nothing to do with its power. In fact, you could say you’re making it more powerful, since you’ll be more productive while using it as a single-purpose device! While the bright minds in Silicon Valley may have a lot of resources to gain your attention, with digital minimalism and the tools of a growing resistance, you can maintain your autonomy and stay focused on what really matters. The key message in these blinks: Digital minimalism is a way of life that attempts to respond to the emerging dangers of today’s digital media landscape. An increasing amount of data is contributing to two realities – that businesses in the attention economy are purposefully making their products addictive and that increased exposure to these products is detrimental to our health. It is only sensible that we reexamine our relationship to these services and our smartphones in general. By following the methods and principles of digital minimalism, we can reclaim our attention and gain an increased sense of satisfaction in life.    Actionable advice: Delete social media from your phone. When most people apply the screening process of digital minimalism to any social media platform, they find that the costs outweigh the benefits. But if you have good cause to maintain a presence on social media, it is then recommended that you at least delete the app from your phone and only engage with it through a web browser. Not having constant access to social media will already noticeably improve your life. By putting in this small amount of extra effort, many people either realize  that social media was not beneficial at all, or they become optimal users who spend as little time as they need, thereby gaining more time for high-quality pursuits.

This is the path that many aim to follow, and more often than not each of these steps is considered integral for a successful life. In fact, the aspiration of getting a formal education has become a defining characteristic of the generations following the mid-twentieth century. Think about it: how many times have you heard someone say that you had better get a degree “unless you want to flip burgers for a living”? However, more and more people are discovering that there are other ways to equip themselves with the skills and connections necessary to succeed in today’s job market. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to forget about fighting for a lofty degree and saddling yourself with debt by taking a different path: independent learning. In these blinks you’ll discover how one entrepreneur became a high school teacher without having a high school diploma; how having a little chutzpah can mean big rewards in the future; and how taking a professor out to lunch can save you from the debt of a college education. Many people today have shelled out a lot of money and racked up mountains of debt in order to get a college education, hoping that a job opportunity down the line will help them recoup all of the money they’ve invested. However, many never find such an opportunity. College degrees are losing their value, and it’s not always true that people with a degree will have higher lifetime earnings. While college degrees have proven their value since World War II, the trend has shifted. When the GI Bill was passed shortly after World War II, war veterans returning home had an opportunity to start a new life by having their college tuition paid for by the government. Consequently, the percentage of US citizens with college degrees spiked hugely.   Meanwhile, a college degree became prerequisite for an increasing number of jobs, such as journalism or public relations. In addition, more women began receiving a college education to secure better jobs. Already at a disadvantage in the employment market, women in the US were able to forge new job opportunities by demonstrating aptitude with a degree. During that time, college degrees guaranteed higher lifetime earnings due to moderate loan debt, easy employability and an annual increase in the value of a college degree. But those times are over. Getting a degree is no longer a safe path. As more people with similar credentials flood the job market and the cost of education rises, higher competition and generally low wages mean that repaying college debt isn’t easy. What’s more, degrees aren’t the only kind of credential and are even becoming less necessary, while other credentials, such as portfolios and recommendations, are becoming increasingly important. Work portfolios, for example, are as good at convincing prospective employers to hire you as is any degree. More and more often, jobs are found through network connections and within communities. Just knowing who’s hiring can help you land a job as much as a degree can. When you go to school, teachers issue demands and then reward you with high marks for grades, tests and “correct” answers, and you eventually get a degree. This method can hardly be considered personally rewarding. In fact, for many, these rewards are demotivating, and cause people to lose their passion and curiosity at school. The rigid structures and expectations, combined with the competition for artificially scarce rewards (grades), stifles and confines our curiosity. The rewards offered at school are forms of external motivation. Your grades, praise for getting “correct” answers, and a degree are all rewards that come from the outside. However, we are far more motivated by intrinsic motivation, when we do things because the reward is the task itself. If you’ve ever just felt good admiring your achievement or mastery over something, then you’ve experienced intrinsic motivation. While the traditional school systems barely offer opportunity for intrinsic motivation, self-organized independent learning initiatives do, and the benefits of this learning style are amazing. In fact, learning what you want to learn leads to better and faster achievements as well as a longer period of engagement. However, independent learning doesn’t mean doing everything on your own. Instead, you should join groups and share in the experience of learning with others, yet remain self-motivated and self-organized. Some modern forms of learning have attempted to use technology to try to open up education, such as Massive Open Online Classes (MOOC). However, they haven’t been successful, because they replicate schools: For example, professors vary widely in their teaching skills and engagement. In addition, grading systems are built around tests or quizzes without proper feedback, meaning it’s unlikely that you’ll retain the material for long. MOOCs put teaching, not learning, online, but this is totally backward: it’s not teaching that has to be reformed, but learning itself. Even though independent learning has a lot to offer, too many people depend on schools to abolish them entirely. Moreover, independent learning still relies on the materials produced by and for schools and universities. Independent learners have to learn how to obtain their own material and information in order to shift away from a reliance on standardized schools. Interlibrary loans, for example, are a great way to acquire the texts you need to learn something new. Independent learners can find copies of federal documents as well at Government Documents Centers, often housed in university libraries. Scientific articles, on the other hand, are a bit harder to find. However, while they are most often found in expensive journals, the trend is toward open access. Open access gives independent learners a chance to access information which is normally only available either with money or at universities. It also signals that universities are open to finding ways to remain important sources of information. Many scientists themselves want to share their ideas and results with a much broader group. At the time this book was written, 13,000 researchers had gone on strike and withheld their work from journals, wanting instead for their work, as well as the discussions and criticisms of their work, to be  freely available. Not only that, but they’re often not even paid for their articles or reviews, despite the prohibitive costs of the journals! Some intellectuals are even actively taking their articles and ideas to other platforms, such as public lectures, more diverse publications or even tutorials. If this trend continues and more intellectuals and academics follow suit, the wealth of freely available knowledge will make independent learning far easier in the future. Now that you’ve learned about the substance and value of independent learning, the rest of our blinks will give you practical tips to reap its rewards. Many people imagine that all independent learners are autodidacts, poring over books at home in complete isolation. However, self-teaching without community is not the best way to learn! Successful independent learners connect, interact and share. Quality learning requires the support of not only learning materials, but also other learners. By learning with others, you have an opportunity to share your knowledge and experience with the group, and have others do the same for you. This exchange of information also allows you to share  feedback on how you and others might improve. In fact, Quinn Norton, a writer and photographer interviewed for this book, emphasizes that you learn best when others tell you what they know. In return, you offer some of your own knowledge that the other learner is interested in. Whether this leads to a short connection or a long relationship, you’re actually using your knowledge to interact. Contrast this collaboration with schools, which are defined by a certain passivity – you are merely a  sponge absorbing knowledge. Passive learning through things like attending lectures is a great starting point for many, because it offers them a chance to encounter new material and find out exactly what it is that interests them within a specific field. However, teaching is equally important. In fact, presenting the knowledge you’ve gained to others is fundamental to successful learning for two reasons: not only do you get to test and enrich your own knowledge, but you will also feel like you’ve achieved something.  When you were in school, did you learn about what you were interested in, or what someone else decided was important for you? Probably the latter. But what would you learn if you were free to decide? As an independent learner, you are free to choose your own educational path. However, you should make sure that you are learning things that you actually want to learn – your learning should be driven by curiosity and a thirst for a certain type of knowledge. As we’ve seen earlier, learning inspired by intrinsic motivations is far more satisfying and sustaining than learning inspired by external ones. Creative writer Dan Sinker describes intrinsic motivation as a pressure within himself, something that he urgently wants to know, understand or be able to do. In order to harness that motivation, you’ll first have to identify it, as well as the processes and methods that help you learn the best. While this will come at the cost of some frustration, in the end you will discover the learning strategy that works best for you. Let’s say you want to learn a new language. You might want to learn systematically, meticulously following each chapter in a grammar book. Or you might prefer a more chaotic approach, learning from various sources, interacting with people who speak that language, and in no particular order. However you go about it, follow your interests in your own way. But whichever method you use, be sure to involve real-life context, as this drastically improves learning. Learning in a real-life context gives the impression that your learning has real consequences, both positive and negative. You will find yourself failing, but with that failure comes greater motivation and personal rewards as well as better retention of what you’ve learned. Indie-culture tastemaker Jim Munroe, for example, always wants to learn by doing, which is only possible in a real-world context. He believes that by putting his work in front of an audience he can more thoroughly internalize criticisms, knowledge and skills. Most people think that, without the right credentials, some jobs are impossibly out of their reach. Lacking a degree, some might not even try to get the job they want. But these assumptions are totally misguided. If you lack proper credentials, then you’ll need to show chutzpah, or an insistent, confident attitude, in order to land the job, and you’ll have to be prepared to learn. Even if you don’t have the particular knowledge and skills that your employer wants, it’s okay to be sure of yourself and your potential, if you believe you can successfully master the knowledge and skills needed. In order to get across to your potential employer that you can excel at the job, it may be necessary to stretch the truth a little. Author and journalist Quinn Norton shows us how being able to “fake it till you make it” can lead to better opportunities. For example, knowing that she had the skills for the job, she was able to become a high school computer teacher without a high school diploma herself. While chutzpah is important, evidence that you know what you’re doing, such as recommendations, can open doors. An important resource in finding a job is the economy of generosity – helpfulness is always a two-way street. This will come in handy, because in order to get access to jobs and knowledge about jobs, you’ll need help. For instance, you’ll need someone to introduce you to whoever’s hiring or pass along your portfolio. You might also be able to help others land a job, and hopefully they’ll connect you to other opportunities in the future. ComBots Cup organizer Simone Davalos explains that she was only able to start her robotics business because of her connections with people who did similar work, who could help her find space and funding for her projects. Now she tries to do the same, opening doors for others just as her network helped her to gain a foothold in a new industry. People who graduate with MBAs love to tell you that the network you’ll build is worth the money you pay for the education. However, you can build a professional network as an independent learner, too. If you embark on independent learning, then you should make it a goal to get in touch with others who are interested in the same or related topics, as connecting with like-minded people will help you make progress toward your own objectives. Not only will being able to share your passion keep you motivated, but also communicating with others about your work means that they have a basis for giving you recommendations and hooking you up with their connections later on. Consider the serial entrepreneur Caterina Rindi, for example. In order to learn more about running a business, she set up an alternative business network based on mutual improvement. In the group, members shared experiences and funding options to support each other and each other’s businesses. Everything she knows about business and administration came from her community and friends! But even experts can be brought into your network without you having formal education. Because most experts are deeply interested in their specialties and enjoy discussing them, you can benefit from their knowledge and information if you can just get them one-on-one. Getting in touch with professors or other experts isn’t difficult, but should be planned. Write them a simple email with questions that they’ll find interesting, and not merely the kinds whose answers you can find with a quick internet search. Be sure to show your own engagement and interest in the subject matter, as well. Remember, too, that professors and experts are probably busy. Your email should contain clearly worded questions, using bullet points, to make their lives as easy as possible. Software engineer Zack Booth Simpson used this approach, and learned by asking professors to lunch and reading textbooks. As it turns out, the cost of a few lunches is far less than the cost of college tuition! A job isn’t just a place to earn a paycheck – it’s also the best place to learn. Not only will you learn from your tasks and from the wisdom of others, but you also gain valuable networking opportunities. But this is only possible if you remain objective about your work. In other words, don’t pretend to be an expert if you’re still learning, and know where you can improve. Being objective allows you to give and receive valuable feedback at work, meaning that both you and your co-workers have a lot to gain. In fact, you’ll find lots of people are also looking for feedback on their own work, and not just phoney politeness. And, as exemplified by author and journalist Dan Sinker, even grunt work can prove to be a necessary skill in another field. He couldn’t have known that the hours he put into video editing would later translate into a crucial skill when editing his online magazine! What’s more, you’ll learn how to find the best sources of information in order to develop your skills in a given field. If you are starting a job in unfamiliar territory, you’ll have to read up on the knowledge and skills necessary for your work. But often at a new job your co-workers are also trying to develop their skills, meaning that you can collaborate on finding new valuable sources of information. Indeed, the best job is the the one in which you’ll learn the most, often the case at smaller companies. Because you aren’t just a cog in a giant machine, small companies give you the leeway to try new things, assert some influence and see the results. Learning on the job is best achieved by adopting the attitude of an apprentice: be helpful, ask quality questions frequently and take risks. The key message in this book: Going to college or university no longer guarantees future success like it did in the past. Luckily, today’s independent learners can get a better education for less money, open up more career opportunities and have more fun in the process if they use the tools at their disposal.

There are always tasks to do, information to analyze, people to meet. How can we possibly get everything done? Surely we need to concentrate on speed, and work quickly to fit everything in. Nope. If we want to lead our most fulfilled lives, we need to start slowing down, not speeding up. The key to getting the most out of life is to disengage from the crazy, fast-paced modern world and take a more considered, mindful path. These blinks will tell you all you need to know. In these blinks you’ll discover why the past and the future do not matter; what the small stuff is and how not to sweat it; and why you should smile at the mailman. What attitude do you need if you want to get the most out of life? Most people think we have to give up relaxation and happiness if we really want to achieve our goals. We need to concentrate, have a competitive attitude and live a disciplined life of hard work. Is this correct? Actually, no. Constantly working yourself into a stressed-out state will only leave you fatigued and unhappy. You won’t get any closer to your goals – you’ll just run yourself into the ground. If you want to truly realize your dreams, it’s much better to have a relaxed and contemplative approach to life. When you do, it’s actually much easier to get things done. But how do you start? Start by relaxing whenever you can. You might think you should only relax on holidays or the weekend, but that’s not true. You should always be able to take a break after you’ve been working too hard. Another way you can enjoy a relaxing, contemplative outlook is to act bored. Seriously! Try and make yourself bored on purpose. It might be frustrating in the beginning but you’ll eventually come to enjoy the freedom and peace it brings. If you want to lead a more relaxed life, you have to stop living for other people and follow your own will. We often work ourselves into unhappiness because we’re trying to please others. Stop doing what you think other people want from you – it’ll only stress you out. It’s impossible to please everyone all the time. It’s much healthier to be true to yourself and your own goals. So take a step back. Remind yourself that your life isn’t an emergency. Most people want to look important, so they push themselves to do things that’ll be well perceived. We create a lot of problems for ourselves when we do this. It’s natural to want to be in the spotlight. We want to speak our minds and impress people. Unfortunately, this can be very harmful to our relationships. When we interrupt people or fail to listen to them respectfully, we make them nervous or irritable. Instead, try to let go of your ego, be patient and let them finish. That can be difficult at times, but it’ll certainly improve your interaction and help you work through any problems. If you’re determined to always be right, you’ll alienate yourself from the people who really matter. So even if you feel the need to correct something a loved one says, just stay calm and let them keep speaking. This will create a much more relaxed atmosphere between the two of you. We also tend to harbor resentment for anyone we’ve had an argument or misunderstanding with. When we do this, we turn small stuff into big stuff in our minds. Don’t hold on to your anger. It can lead you to turn a small argument with a friend into something big – like deciding to never talk to them again. Why do we do this? Well, we tend to see forgiveness as a sign of weakness and insecurity. We subconsciously want to protect our images by giving up relationships with loved ones in hopes that they’ll come back to us. You can avoid this by simply letting go of your need to be right, and focusing on being happy instead. Keep the small stuff small. There are much more important things to care about, like creating a better world. You can put all your effort into making yourself happy but still feel empty inside. What’s a better alternative? Making others happy instead! Sharing your love with others can be magical. You won’t just make them happier – you’ll make yourself happier too. We’re often so busy working toward our goals that we forget to appreciate the things that matter most. So take a break each day and think about the people you’re thankful for, or write a heartfelt letter once a week. Let your loved ones know that you’re grateful to have them. Your gesture doesn’t have to change the person’s life but it’ll certainly brighten their day. Little acts of kindness – like taking out the trash instead of waiting for your partner to do it – can make a big difference. And what about the people you don’t love? The ones who annoy you? If you want to be happier, give them a break! People can certainly be annoying or frustrating but that doesn’t mean you should get upset. Instead, try to understand what’s causing them to be that way. When you empathize with them, they’ll annoy you less. If you get angry because the postal clerk is moving slowly, for instance, think about it from their perspective. They’re not doing it annoy you, they’re probably just having a bad day – so give them a break! The more compassion you have for others, the happier you’ll feel. So give that clerk a smile – it might turn their day around. It’ll make you feel better too. Treat yourself well by treating others well. Your entire life is a reflection of your thoughts. So make sure you think positively! Your thoughts create your reality. It’s very important to be aware of that. You don’t just observe your thinking – you live it out. Fortunately, you have the power to control what’s happening in your mind. When you’re stuck in a bad mood, focus on changing the way you think. Remember that everything will pass. Nothing stays forever. Every moment is temporary and you can choose to feel better whenever you want. A good way to train your thoughts and become more optimistic is to spend time alone. When you take time for yourself, you give yourself a precious gift. Whether it’s ten minutes of meditation, yoga or spending time in nature, quiet time is an important part of your life. Another important part of thinking positively is to stop fighting against your problems. When you confront your problems with aggressiveness, you’ll only get more frustrated. You don’t achieve happiness by getting rid of your problems – you achieve it by learning from them. Your problems can serve as great teachers. View them as a source of awakening. Let’s say your problem is that you feel envious of someone else’s happiness. First, try to understand why you feel this way. What part of your life are you unsatisfied with and what can you do to make it better? Focus on what you have instead of what you don’t have. If you find yourself wishing your partner was different, try thinking about their positive qualities. Instead of complaining about your salary, be grateful you have a job. You’ll start to feel much better about your life. You can’t control the outside world but you can control what happens inside. People are nervous and anxious far too often. We forget to take a deep breath and enjoy the only moment we really have: now! If you want peace of mind, it’s essential to live in the moment. We tend to dwell on problems from the past and worry about the future so much that we end up frustrated, depressed and anxious. You can avoid these problems by staying focused on the here and now. Concentrate on your breathing for a few minutes. It’s a great way to bring your mind into the present moment. It’s very destructive to always want to be somewhere else. Appreciate where you are at the moment. When you focus on where you are now, you’ll find peace even when things are challenging. Don’t keep holding out for the perfect moment – it’ll never come. Of course it’s frustrating when life isn’t exactly what you want, but the secret to being happy is to appreciate the present. You also need to be patient. When you’re patient with yourself and your life, you’ll be more willing to accept things as they are. So practice patience on a daily basis. If you get stressed out at work, take five minutes to focus on your breathing and forget about your boss. You might even gain some new insights on the situation during those five minutes. Doing too many things at once can also prevent you from enjoying the moment. Don’t be too anxious to finish all your tasks at once. Pace yourself and try to learn something from everything you do. Remember: the present is the only time that really exists. Cherish it for what it is. We live in a very fast-paced world. Everything needs to be done right now and it needs to be done perfectly. This constant rush puts a lot of pressure on us, even as we go through the most basic tasks in our daily lives. You may think you can bring out your best by being a perfectionist. That will never work. If you strive to be perfect, you’ll only end up focusing on your flaws. So the next time you catch yourself looking in the mirror and thinking about the five pounds you want to lose, remind yourself that your body is an amazing instrument that lets you live a magical and beautiful life. Focus on the things you appreciate rather than the things you want to change. Remember: your life isn’t an emergency. A lot of people neglect their families and dreams because they feel they need to do as much work as they can, as quickly as possible. But really there’s nothing more important than your happiness. So when you’re feeling stressed out or under pressure, just stop for a minute. Repeat to yourself that nothing is an emergency. Call someone you love or do something that makes you happy. Aim to be relaxed even when things aren’t going your way. We often procrastinate on relaxing, just thinking we’ll do it later. That’s not true – you can relax now. Even when you’re genuinely busy it’s still possible to clear your mind. You have to make the choice though, so push yourself to go through your day with a relaxed attitude. Your problems will gradually melt away. You have to decide for yourself how you want to live your life.   The key message in this book: Your life is a reflection of your thoughts – when you master your thoughts you can master yourself. So stay calm, even in situations where you think you can’t. Thinking positively, take the time to appreciate your loved ones and let go of your animosity. Live in the moment. When you learn to keep the small stuff small, you’ll find real happiness and peace of mind. Actionable advice: Don’t harbor negative feelings toward others. If someone’s annoying or upsetting you, try to understand their perspective instead of getting angry. If you have a fight with a loved one, don’t hold onto your resentment. When you treat others well, you won’t just make them happier – you’ll make yourself happier too.

Most of us have probably attempted to follow at least one strict eating plan at some point. And how many of us have benefitted from this in the long term? Likely very few. Chances are, many will have given up halfway through, while others would simply return to their unhealthy habits right after completing the chosen program. So what should we be doing instead? These blinks, based on the views of Tom Rath, who has battled a long-term serious illness to lead a tremendously healthy and prosperous life, show that anyone can become healthy in the long run. All you need to do is focus on eating right, moving right and, crucially, sleeping right.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why, when it comes to eating right, quality is better than quantity; why going to the gym is pointless if you spend all day in a chair; and why sugar is probably killing you right now. A lot of people don’t start taking care of themselves until their doctor utters some fateful words, likely along the lines of “You’re out of shape,” or “You’d better start shaping up if you want to make it to your retirement.” If you want to avoid this awkward conversation, heed this simple advice before a doctor gives it to you.  Living a healthy lifestyle isn’t easy. It can be hard to say no to a can of soda or a larger portion of fries, but resisting these temptations will bring you great benefits. The sooner you start treating your body right, the better your chances of living a long and healthy life.  In fact, researchers from the University of Gothenburg found that 90 percent of the population could live to be 90 years of age or older simply by making some important lifestyle choices. You can increase your energy levels, maximize your potential at work and sleep better just by eating the right foods, starting with a healthy breakfast.  It’s true that health is partly determined by your genes, but it’s important to develop healthy habits regardless of your genetic makeup. You can’t change your DNA but you can change your lifestyle. And your lifestyle itself has an impact on your genes! Tom Rath, the author, is an extreme case of this. When he was only 16, he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which shuts off the gene in charge of suppressing tumors, leading to the growth of cancers throughout the body. Instead of giving up, the author focused on what he could control: his diet, exercise and sleep. He learned how to decrease the odds of the cancers spreading and has managed to live a long and healthy life.   Even if you have a genetic tendency to be obese, for example, exercise can reduce that predisposition by up to 40 percent. Maintaining the right diet is trickier than it seems. You can always check food labels for nutritional information, but that isn’t enough on its own. You have to think a lot more deeply about your food if you really want to be healthy.  There’s one question you should ask yourself before you take a bite of anything: Is this a net gain or a net loss in terms of nutritional value? People go on diets assuming they’ll reach a specific end point. For example, they might hope to lose ten pounds by avoiding carbohydrates for two months. Diets are thus short-term; they’re not enough for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Long-term healthy eating means determining for yourself whether your food has a positive or negative effect on your body, and this means considering all the ingredients that it contains. A healthy salad, for instance, can become a net loss if you add fried chicken and bacon to it. Rath realized his favorite dish, salmon with barbecue sauce, was a net loss because of the sauce’s sugar content. So he turned it into a net gain by learning to enjoy the taste of salmon on its own, without the sauce.  Also, the quality of what you eat is more important than the quantity. Don’t just rely on counting calories – there’s a lot more to your food than that.  Overall, try to eat foods with a ratio of at least one gram of protein to each gram of carbohydrate. But that doesn’t mean you can eat bacon and sausages all day! Processed meat should be last on your list of proteins.  Meanwhile, some foods should always be avoided, like potato chips, which have over 20 grams of carbohydrate for each gram of protein! When it comes to staying active, going to the gym every two days isn’t enough; you have to limit your inactivity, too. Chronic inactivity is a big risk in the modern world, as a great deal of people have jobs that require them to sit at a desk all day. This only adds to our other inactive hours that we have while sleeping, driving somewhere or watching TV. Reducing your chronic inactivity is even more important than doing short exercise sessions. In fact, a 240,000-person study by the National Institutes of Health found that adults who spend the most time seated have a 50 percent higher mortality rate; even exercising for seven hours a week wasn’t enough to reduce this. If you sit for more than six hours a day, your risk of death increases at a rate similar to the risk of smoking or being overexposed to sunlight. Your good cholesterol drops by 20 percent after just two hours of sitting – and you’ll start burning calories at a rate of only one per minute! So try to be active in your daily routine by adjusting your habits. It’s more effective than irregular exercise and it’s easier too! It’s okay to start small. The idea of “getting in shape” might sound tough, but taking the stairs instead of the elevator is easy. Every task is an opportunity to fit some more activity into your day. And stay active at home too! Home is the most convenient place to develop a more active lifestyle. Get a treadmill, elliptical machine or start doing aerobics with online videos. In addition, try to cut down on your TV time. People who watch over four hours of television per day are more than twice as likely to suffer a major cardiac event. Few people get a proper amount of sleep these days. Sure, we’re all busy – but sleep is one thing you should never neglect. There’s a common misconception that people who sleep less are harder workers; they stay up all night because they’re endlessly productive. But while staying up until 5:00 a.m. to prepare for the next morning’s presentation might sound like dedication, it’s actually quite the opposite. You’re less alert on a day when you haven’t slept enough the night before, so your presentation won’t be nearly as good as it would be if you had gotten a good sleep. In fact, studies have shown that losing just 90 minutes of sleep decreases your alertness by one-third.  Think of it this way: who would you rather have fly your plane – a well-rested pilot or a pilot who stayed up all night studying landing techniques? There’s an unfortunate reason most of us don’t get enough sleep. In our fast-paced society, sleep is viewed as a sign of weakness. The author learned this from his parents as a child, so he stayed up late as a teenager even when he wasn’t doing anything productive. Over time, this took its toll on his academic performance. He felt like going to sleep was wrong or lazy. The highest-performing people actually tend to have healthy sleeping habits. You may have heard of the famous study that found that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become brilliant at  something. But did you know that same study also found that top performers get an average of eight hours and 36 minutes of sleep each night? By comparison, the average American sleeps only six hours and 51 minutes on weeknights. Sleep is a vital part of reaching your goals, so don’t write it off as a sign of laziness.  Would you give your child a cigarette? What about a sugary snack? You might’ve answered “no” to the first question and “yes” to the second, but cigarettes and sugar are more similar than you think in terms of the harm they can cause the human body. Sugar is a toxin and it’s very unhealthy. Together with its derivatives, it fuels diabetes, obesity, heart disease and cancer.  The average person consumes their own weight or more in sugar every year. Added sugar in processed foods is always unnecessary – healthy foods like fruits and vegetables already contain enough natural sugar as they are.  Added sugar is only there to give your food extra flavor; it doesn’t have any nutritional value and it’s dangerous to our health. One Harvard University study found that sugary drinks contribute to 180,000 deaths every year! Some nutritionists even call sugar “candy for cancer cells,” because it accelerates aging and inflammation, fueling tumor growth in turn.  Sugar is also addictive, which means it should be treated like any other drug. It’s important to keep it under control so that it doesn’t control us.  Your brain gets excited and releases dopamine when you eat sugar, in the same way that it does if you smoke a cigarette. And like cigarettes, the more sugar you eat, the more of it you crave. You also build a tolerance to it, so you have to eat more and more of it to experience that same pleasurable sensation.  The best way to avoid this cycle of abuse is to never start in the first place. Look out for other sugary products and ingredients too, like agave nectar, aspartame, dextrose, fructose, corn syrup and even honey. Some of those foods may be healthier than sugar, but they’ll still increase your craving for sweet and sugary foods.  Have you ever felt tired, even after sleeping for nine or ten hours? Sleep is an instinctive act and we all do it, but it’s still something you can improve. Since it’s such a fundamental part of your health, it’s important to sleep efficiently. Efficient sleep is the time when you’re really sleeping, and not just tossing and turning in bed. Some people might lie in bed for nine hours but only get five hours of real sleep.  The Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase is the most important part of efficient sleep. This is when your brain processes your thoughts and memories, putting them into perspective for you. REM sleep also plays a key role in overcoming difficult or traumatic events.  There are a few strategies to use for getting adequate REM sleep.  First off, try to limit your use of the snooze button. Lots of us give ourselves an extra hour or half hour of sleep each morning, but that extra sleep isn’t useful if it’s broken up every five minutes.  So set your alarm to go off at the latest possible time; let yourself get as much sleep as you can.  You should also limit your exposure to artificial light before you go to bed. Artificial light has a negative impact on your melatonin, which plays a key role in regulating your sleep cycle. So if you read before bed, use a small reading lamp, and try not to watch TV or go on the computer just before you sleep.  A good night’s sleep impacts your health in a number of ways. In fact, research has shown that people with low sleep efficiency are 5.5 times more likely than efficient sleepers to develop a cold. The key message in this book: Staying healthy isn’t just one decision; it’s dozens of little decisions every day. You don’t have to reinvent yourself to get in shape and increase your chances of living a long and healthy life. Start by eating a lot of protein, avoiding excess sugar or carbohydrates, limiting stretches of inactivity and taking the stairs instead of the elevator whenever you can. Finally, get enough sleep and make sure it’s the right kind of sleep. A lot of little changes taken together can make a big difference.  Actionable advice: Eat fruits and vegetables with dark and vibrant colors. There’s no shortcut for knowing the healthiest foods, but going for dark, vibrant fruits and vegetables is a good rule of thumb. Eat anything green, like broccoli, spinach, kale or cucumbers. Red and blue fruits like apples, strawberries and raspberries are also highly nutritious.

Are they lucky or uniquely gifted in ways you aren’t? Well, probably not. What they most likely do have is a proven recipe for success. The trick is simply choosing the right cookbook.  Luckily, you’ve already done that. In these blinks, we’ll break your performance down into four key areas or “capacities” – spiritual, intellectual, physical and emotional. Think of them as tools that, when used together, will see you through any project.  This is valuable because life is full of demanding long-term projects. Whether it’s your personal life and its many relationships or your career with its numerous challenges and hurdles, success is the fruit of patience, diligence and flexibility. In these blinks, you’ll also learn  how to gain clarity on your mission in life;  why mornings are the best time to start building new routines; and  why your brain suffers when you don’t take care of your physical health.  Do you want to improve yourself and achieve more? Great – you’re in the right place! Let’s kick things off with the two most important words in these blinks: building capacity. This is about continually learning and honing new skills that allow you to elevate yourself and grow. What it doesn’t mean is simply doing more things – you also have to do the right things.  There are four principal areas when it comes to building capacity. The first is spiritual capacity. This is about focusing on getting to know yourself and clarifying your values and desires. Next up is intellectual capacity. This includes how you think, plan and execute with maximum efficiency and discipline. Then there’s physical capacity – your physical health and well-being. Finally, there’s emotional capacity. That’s your ability to deal with challenging situations and get the most out of your relationships.  One way to visualize these areas is as a ball divided into four chambers, each of which can be filled with gas. The 2D version of this ball would look like a pie cut into four quarters. The more air you pump into each of these chambers, the more momentum the ball will have as it moves. But here’s the catch: if you’re not filling each chamber with the same amount of gas, the ball will start to wobble and go off track. It’s the same with your capacities. All four need to be balanced. This means developing them simultaneously with equal care and attention.  Now, building capacity isn’t something that happens overnight. It’s like working out. Sure, you have to be motivated to book your first gym session, but that’s just the start. If you want to build muscle and get that washboard stomach, you need to be hitting the gym week after week and improving bit by bit.  Building capacity is just like that – after all, achieving big goals takes time and dedication. Most importantly, it means taking those small steps that will carry you over the finish line every day. Sometimes, the process takes months; other times, it’s a matter of years. Stick at it, though, and you’re sure to realize your dreams.   So, now that you know how to build capacity in theory, let’s take a look at what you need to do in practice.  Building capacity isn’t something you can do willy-nilly. Before you start expending your time and energy, you need to be clear about what it is you’re trying to achieve and why. That’s exactly what “spiritual” means in this context – it’s about figuring out who you are and what you want. Think of it as a compass that will keep you on course and ensure you’re using your resources to get to where you want to go.  So here’s the million-dollar question: how do you do that?  Well, if you want to define your core values, you need to ask the right questions. This means taking time to reflect on what’s most important to you. Ask yourself what makes you feel happy and energizes you, and also what gets you down and saps your energy. In other words, when do you succeed and when do you struggle?  The next step is to reach out to friends, family members and colleagues and ask them how they see things. Here you’ll want to compare your answers with theirs to make sure you’re seeing things clearly. Then, you’ll want to take all those answers and look for common words. Maybe “compassion” crops up repeatedly, or maybe “independence” is a running theme. Whittle down that list to just four or five key concepts. These are your core values – the principles by which you want to live.  That brings us to your core purpose. This is your mission in life. It combines your values and gives you a clear sense of where you’re going. The author, for example, defines his purpose as “finding a better way and sharing it,” and it’s this that motivated him to write his book.  Take a moment to examine your values and then see if you can form a sentence that represents your long-term direction in life. If you’re struggling to do that, try writing your own obituary. It might sound a little macabre, but this is a great way of getting out of your head and asking yourself how you’d like others to see you. That will likely contain vital clues about your core purpose.  The last step is to begin aligning your actions with your values and purpose. This is all about putting your energy in the right place. True success is the fruit of this alignment. Fail to do that and your success won’t be defined by you but by others.  If you’ve updated your computer software recently, you’ll know how much more efficiently and smoothly applications run when you give them a bit of TLC. The same thing happens when you work on your intellectual capacity. The more time you put into it, the more tasks you’ll accomplish while expending the same amount of energy.  The key to building that capacity is a growth mindset. People who adopt this attitude reject the fixed mindset – the idea that our intellectual capacity is fixed at a predetermined point. This is all about embracing the fact that it’s never too late to learn new skills and that mistakes and failures are simply part of the process.  The growth mindset is vital to your efforts to expand your intellectual capacity, but it’s not something you can cultivate on your own. That brings us to the second step: finding mentors who will help you keep learning and growing. The world’s high-flyers and top performers all have one thing in common: they surround themselves with coaches and mentors who challenge them to keep improving. These people are so important because they don’t tell you what you want to hear – they tell you what you need to hear. They pull you up on avoidable mistakes and point out how you can achieve more.  That’s vital because we’re all short-sighted when it comes to understanding ourselves. Sometimes, you need an objective outsider to tell it like it is.  Finally, you’ll need to use routines to set yourself up for success. Routines are important because they help you make a habit of being productive. That’s crucial when it comes to achieving long-term goals like learning a language or writing a book.  The best time for this is the morning. It’s as simple as waking up 15 minutes earlier than usual and using this extra time for quiet, focused work. Once this habit has been consolidated, you can start adding extra minutes to your routine. What, for example, would happen if you got up a full hour before your family and used the time to meditate, work out and jot down ideas for your book?  These are small tweaks to your daily schedule but, cumulatively, they can add up to life-altering changes.  Physical capacity is about more than just being able to run a marathon. When your body is in poor shape, your brain also suffers: you’re more easily distracted, less resilient and more likely to be knocked back by stress and setbacks. That means it’s time to start looking after your health.  Let’s start with what you eat. The key point here is to make sure you’re getting a balanced and nutritious diet. Highly processed junk food is everywhere today and, in many countries, people are more likely to die as a result of obesity than they are from starvation. But with so many different kinds of diets out there, it’s often hard to choose what’s right for you. Is paleo better than keto, for example? Or is low-carb preferable to slow-carb?  Well, let’s make things easier with a tip from author and journalist Michael Pollan. His rule of thumb is simple: don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t have recognized as food.   Next up: managing stress. Stress isn’t necessarily a bad thing – in fact, it was stress that ensured our ancient ancestors were alert and attentive enough to spot dangers. Unfortunately, our brains respond to our frenetic, digitalized world in much the same way as they would to snakes and tigers. This means that many of us are regularly experiencing more stress than we can cope with.  According to Dr. Heidi Hanna, the most effective way to reduce stress is to take regular short breaks throughout the day. These allow you to take a deep breath, relax or even meditate. Getting enough sleep is also essential to your performance levels and well-being, so make sure you’re spending a good 6-8 hours in the Land of Nod each night.  And here’s one last tip: embrace competition. This has become something of a dirty word, but it’s important to remember that competition shouldn’t be about crushing your opponents and winning at all costs. What it really means is going the extra mile and challenging yourself to become better. Whether it’s intellectual or physical competition, it will push you to build your capacity.  Finally, we come to emotional capacity – the tool you’ll use to navigate your relationships both with yourself and others. This has two sides: dealing with people around you and dealing with unintended consequences. Think of driving a car: to do this well, you have to keep an eye on other road users while also anticipating their sudden swerves and stops.  Building emotional capacity begins by leaving your comfort zone. It’s all too easy to get stuck in a particular mindset, hemmed in by limiting beliefs or the low expectations of others. Overcoming these boundaries is only possible when you set yourself new challenges or allow someone else to push you. If you’ve ever had a colleague or friend tell you something you didn’t want to hear, you’ll know all about this. Sure, it’s uncomfortable at first, but it ultimately motivates you to make improvements.  Stepping out of your comfort zone also builds your resilience. This is a vital skill. Every day, we face new challenges and situations which can throw us off course. The more resilient you are, the more likely you are to clear those hurdles.  So how do you do it? Well, it’s as simple as trying new things. You can cook an unfamiliar dish or travel somewhere new, for example. You can also try doing something you usually shy away from, like cold-calling a potential client or giving a colleague some honest negative feedback.  This isn’t something you can do on your own: to maximize your emotional capacity, you need to surround yourself with the right people. As the author and entrepreneur Jim Rohn once put it, you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with. That’s why it’s so important to seek out people who share your values, energize you and inspire you to be your best self.  The flipside of that is avoiding people who undermine you. These are energy vampires – so-called “friends” or family members who sap your strength and undermine your effort to improve yourself. Disengage from these individuals and you won’t just feel better – you’ll also have more time for relationships that truly elevate you.  The key message in these blinks: The key to boosting your performance and achieving more is working on four core areas of your life. These are your spiritual, intellectual, physical and emotional “capacities.” How do you do that? Well, the best place to start is clarifying what you actually want in life. Once you’re clear about your goal, you can start honing the skills and abilities you’ll need to reach it  Actionable advice: Protect your mornings by keeping them tech-free.  The time between waking up and beginning your routine is crucial – it’s literally what sets you up for the day ahead. Unfortunately, our digital devices and gadgets mean we often fail to make the most of this time. Rather than working on our own projects, we waste these precious minutes answering emails or browsing Facebook. But there’s a simple fix: commit to keeping the first hour of each day tech-free.

They probably do. Unfortunately, our inner voice often sounds like a drill sergeant whose sole job is to make harsh judgments and create a swirl of negative emotions. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to see these self-deprecating words for the distortions that they truly are. You’ll be presented with ways to unhook yourself from the unhelpful patterns and negative emotions that are created by the distorted stories your mind creates. And you’ll learn that being emotionally agile means dealing with your emotions as they arise, an ability that is sure to benefit your relationships and your work, not to mention your relationship with yourself. You’ll also learn why you don’t have to force a smile if you don’t feel like smiling; how downplaying your weaknesses can actually make you less self-confident; and that people who claim to like playing golf are often just kidding themselves. It’s long been known that great movies need a great “hook,” a simple device that motivates the characters and gets the story moving. But hooks exist outside of film, too. In fact, we often get hooked into the story of our own life in the same way. From one moment to the next, our brains are constantly trying to make sense of our experiences and turn them into a coherent story about our lives. They create narratives from billions of pieces of sensory input. For instance, the author’s basic “story” goes like this: \"I am waking up and getting out of bed. The small person jumping at me is my daughter. I grew up in Johannesburg, but I currently live in New York. I need to get up today because I’m a social worker.\" As long as things are simple and positive, it’s not tricky. But the story construction often goes awry. The issue is that the stories our minds manufacture are rarely accurate. Instead, they distort reality, often in a negative way. And that’s not good because misrepresentation produces negative emotions. For instance, let’s say your parents separated soon after your birth. You might blame yourself for their divorce, even though you’re completely innocent. Or you might think you’ll always be unloved because you were a shy, introverted child in a family of extroverts. These kinds of distortions happen every day, and the results can be harmful. Imagine you’re at loggerheads with your boss, but, instead of addressing the issue directly, the event negatively clouds your thinking and so you go home and snap at your spouse because she forgot to run the dishwasher. Thanks to distortion, you’ve not only failed to resolve the conflict with your boss; you’ve riled up your partner, too. Put simply, we rarely see our lives as they really are. Rather, we weave distorted stories that make us emotionally unhappy. Emotional agility is the ability to step back from the emotions and figure out what needs to change. So how should we set about unraveling this mess? Are you ever annoyed by the relentlessly cheerful people who see the world through rose-tinted glasses? Surely it can’t be healthy for them to keep smiling through breakups and bereavements, can it? The simple truth is that it’s not. Forced optimism avails nothing, and avoiding negative emotions by forcing a smile and thinking positive – though a common strategy – tends to do more harm than good. Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley confirmed this a few years ago when they inspected the class photographs of Mills College, a private women’s foundation. Some of the women smiled genuinely, while others forced it. It’s possible to detect the difference. Genuine smiles activate the orbicularis oculi eye muscles and the zygomaticus major mouth muscles. But fake smiles only involve the mouth. When the researchers tracked down the classmates thirty years later, they found that the genuine smilers were blessed with happier lives in terms of marriages, well-being and careers. It was clear: Grinning and bearing it is not a constructive way to deal with negative emotions. It might seem counterintuitive but another reason not to suppress negative emotions is that they can actually be very beneficial. Here’s an example: One of the author’s clients thought he had an anger problem. But, with the author’s help, he realized he was dealing with unreasonable spousal demands and expectations. His response seemed more appropriate given the circumstances. So he took pains to observe and recognize his emotions, which helped him created boundaries and engage in clearer communication with his wife. This hard work gradually improved the marriage. Clearly, facing emotions is better than repressing them. But what’s the best way to achieve that? Many of us imagine our emotions, especially painful ones, as some sort of many-headed monster out to get us. When faced with such a beast, you’d instinctively want to get away as fast as possible. But, in fact, it’s much better to stand your ground and face the monster. This is the first stage in dealing with your emotions: Showing Up. But how do you do it? Well, experience shows that self-compassion is the best way to deal with painful emotions. The path to self-compassion isn’t always easy to follow, but it’s worth walking – and it begins with recognizing and listening to your emotions. Here’s an exercise that’ll help you get started. Imagine yourself as the child you once were. Visualize the life circumstances and difficulties you had. Can you feel compassion for that child? In your mind's eye, embrace and comfort that imagined child. The key step is realizing that the adult you are also needs to be comforted like the child you were. In fact, showing yourself compassion is essential when dealing with painful emotions. In 2012, psychologist David Sbarra made a study of divorcees. He found that participants who expressed self-compassion recovered from divorce faster than those who resorted to self-criticism or blame. There’s a strategy to self-compassion. It involves taking a broad view of yourself, accepting who you are and seeing everything, including all your flaws, with compassion. The psychologist Dr. Kristin Neff conducted a serious examination of self-compassion in 2007 by asking the subjects to present themselves in mock job interviews. The results were obvious. Self-compassionate interviewees talked about their weaknesses openly without diminishing their sense of self-confidence. On the other hand, less self-compassionate interviewees attempted to downplay their weaknesses, but only succeeded in becoming less self-confident as they did so. Self-compassion, then, assists in dealing with negative emotions. But it isn’t always easy to feel it, especially when we’re overwhelmed by emotions. So let’s look next at how to distance ourselves from the whirl of emotion. Is there something that’s niggling at you? You know, something that’s really getting your goat? Classically, people tend to find professional or relationship problems the most troublesome. So, to deal with such situations, choose an object, such as a chair or a pillow, and let it act as a stand-in for your problem. Now yell at it – just scream out everything you feel. It’s a fun exercise. But it’s also helpful, since it allows you to Step Out of your problem by externalizing your feelings, which, in turn, will enable you to see it from a fresh, external perspective. Once you’ve done this, you’ll have an easier time thinking calmly about the destructive emotions that may have given rise to the problem in the first place. On one occasion, the author was fuming at a call-center support agent; the telephone company kept sending incorrect phone bills! After a moment, however, she was able to collect herself, and she saw her emotional reaction for what it was: blind anger directed at the wrong person. After apologizing, she was able to work together with the agent to resolve the billing issue. The creation of space between emotions and yourself will make you a better person. There’s a strategy for doing this. It’s called mindfulness, and it allows you to calmly observe your emotions and your environment. Mindfulness is the practice of paying purposeful attention to something, be it a sensation, an emotion or your breathing, without judgment. The method is based on science. In 2011, psychologists at Harvard took brain scans of people before and after they had gone through mindfulness training, and the comparison showed that the parts of the brain responsible for stress, memory, empathy and identity had been positively altered by the training. Mindfulness can be seen, therefore, as an antidote to distraction. When you’re mindful, you’ll recognize negative emotions for what they are as they arise, and learn to handle them immediately. The next step, once you’re attuned to your emotions, is to look at your life and decide what you want from it. In 2000, Tom Shadyac, the director of Hollywood blockbusters like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, seemed to be on top of the world. He was successful; he was rich; he was still relatively young. But he wasn’t happy. He’d spent years working toward an ideal life, and yet, when he got there, he longed for something different, something simpler. It just goes to show that it’s hard to make decisions that are truly our own, especially when success is judged by standards that have nothing to do with the individual involved. If we don’t think about it, we tend to blindly follow the examples of those around us or live according to an abstract blueprint. The name for this phenomenon is social contagion. You might think you want to play golf, for example, but in fact, you only play because your peers do. The same holds true of money, property, cars and family. But unless you actually happen to enjoy the same activities as your friends, you may feel empty. This is why Tom Shadyac eventually sold most of his possessions, donated significant amounts of money to charity and opened a homeless shelter. He found it more fulfilling to do what he wanted to do, rather than what society expected of him. So fight the urge to follow the herd, and think carefully about what you really want for yourself and from life. A sense of clarity will change your life for the better. One psychological exercise you might like to try is writing a letter to your future self. Can you imagine who you’ll be then, and what you would like to say to that person now? Write about who you are now, and what’s important to you. Writing will help you articulate what matters most to you. It’s no parlor game, either. The results speak for themselves. A 2013 study by psychologist Karen Gelder showed that participants became less likely to take part in illegal activities after engaging in exercises like this one. Consider this normal relationship quarrel. Cynthia's been scrimping and saving for years. And now David, Cynthia’s partner, wants to splurge the money on a family trip to the Grand Canyon. Well, this is actually a real-life example from a 2004 study. Cynthia and David were actually being filmed as they argued, as psychologists Driver and Gottmann attempted to work out what made couples tick by looking at various emotional factors. For this purpose, the two psychologists built an apartment in their lab. They then invited various couples in and asked them to live their lives as normally as possible while the cameras were rolling. It might sound like an odd experiment, but it did reveal some deeper truths about happiness in relationships. Most importantly, the researchers found that the manner in which couples responded to requests for emotional bonding was critical for building mutual happiness and for Moving On positively in their emotional lives. They saw that partners engaged in all sorts of activities, all geared to getting emotional responses from each other, such as pointing out a beautiful object. The partner being petitioned for engagement then tended to react in one of three ways. They either turned toward their partner and offered some sort of response, turned away and didn't respond at all or they reacted strongly against their partner's suggestion, saying, for instance, that they wanted to be left alone. These small behaviors might have seemed inconsequential at the time. But when the researchers revisited the couples six years later, those who had shown high levels of positive emotional response to requests for attention were all still married. Those who had turned away or ignored their partners during the experiment were mostly separated or divorced six years later. So, in order to Move On with your emotional agility, practice making yourself more emotionally available to your partner or friends. Now, let’s look at why leading a balanced personal life is also important. Do you remember what it took to learn to ride a bike? The excitement, the crashes, the elation when you finally managed to keep it going straight? Does cycling still bring you the same feelings? Of course not. It’s now just run-of-the-mill. Well, it turns out that in order to thrive you need to be challenged and develop emotional agility. Once you get too proficient at something, it’s easy to switch on autopilot. This, in turn, leads to rigidity, disengagement and boredom. It’s fine to go through the motions for mundane tasks like brushing your teeth. But life quickly becomes dull and unfulfilling if you aren’t consciously challenged by it. A routine task or job just gets tedious. It’s important, then, to spice things up a bit. Search for something a little daring. Maybe you could launch a new initiative at your workplace? That said, though it’s good to be stimulated, you shouldn’t overdo it. The trick is to balance a little positive stress from new situations with secure feelings of assurance and calm. This is known as living at the edge of your potential. That edge is a line that can be gradually pushed forward, but you shouldn’t suddenly overstep it. A good way to start challenging yourself, perhaps, is to learn a language or how to play a musical instrument. Or you could find small challenges in your daily tasks. You could, for instance, walk to work in a mindful manner, paying attention to your surroundings and movement, instead of daydreaming or fretting about your to-do list. So we've looked at what it takes to practice emotional agility. Let’s consider an example from the workplace to round things off. It's easy to get the wrong impression of someone. The person might seem picture perfect, with a good job and a close family, but then, after you’ve exchanged a few words, you might get the sense that a nervous breakdown is brewing, and that he or she is in fact stuck in emotional distress. When we’re not emotionally agile, we get stuck. Erin, a friend of the author, got trapped in just this way. She was a mother of three, working a job four days a week, but she really struggled to keep her two lives separate. However, she did not show her distress to anyone, or take the time to make changes. On one occasion, her boss scheduled a phone meeting on her day at home. Erin felt she couldn’t say no, but she was also acutely aware that it would be embarrassing if her children could be heard mid-kerfuffle in the background. She ended up taking the call in her closet, crouching beneath her clothes. It was right there, ensconced in her closet, that Erin realized she had to move beyond her threshold of discomfort, talk with her boss and improve her situation. This is the great benefit of emotional agility. It helps us make the changes we need to, in order to get unstuck in our lives. So she mustered all her courage. She needed to know her feelings and explain to her boss just what was wrong. Here’s what she came up with. She resented the troubles she had balancing her work and family life. She was struggling with perfectionism. She took the time to explain that while she loved her work, her day off was sacrosanct. She needed it for her family. The clarification helped all parties and Erin could finally stop being so anxious. The lessons of emotional agility are clear and they can be applied to work relationships and life generally. Remember to distance yourself from the negative patterns in your life, move out of your comfort zone and find creative solutions. The benefits are yours for the taking. The key message in this book: If you’re trying to find more fulfillment in your life, you need to develop your emotional agility – the ability to put distance between yourself and your negative emotional patterns. This gives you the space to examine them and the room to find constructive solutions for your problems. Actionable advice  Skip the small talk and aim for meaningful conversations.  The next time you’re spending time with friends or family, ask yourself if you’re really engaging with them, or whether small talk is being used to deflect or avoid real issues. Don’t be afraid. Go deep and go meaningful. You’ll all feel better for it in the long run. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Are you fed up with your dead-end job? Do you seem to live a life devoid of fun and excitement? If so, don’t despair; plenty of others share your sentiments. The culprit behind our unhappy lives is actually a fear of failure. We are simply terrified of trying anything new because we’re scared we’ll be bad at it and make mistakes. And of course, that holding back leads to a stilted and stale life. These blinks show you how to turn that pattern on its head. They explain that in order to have fun, you need to take risks and embrace failure. In these blinks you’ll discover why you should test-drive your career before settling on it; why you need to create for yourself a geographical fun map; and how Chris Rock ensures his jokes always get a laugh when you see them on TV. Do you feel dissatisfied and bored with your life, of the same old routine of going to work, coming home, and watching television? Then why don’t you make a change? For most of us, the reason is fear. Many people think that in order to achieve their goals they need to have a perfectly formulated action plan. But such a plan is unrealistic and, failing to achieve one, many people are afraid to take action. This outlook on life is known as the not-yet approach: we want success and happiness, but we’re so afraid of failing due to the lack of a perfect plan that whenever it’s time to say action, we say “not-yet.” However, we should reverse this mindset: we should find happiness in the present moment, not wait for a future event to bring us happiness! For starters, we should start doing small things to make ourselves happy; we will likely see positive results. Consider a Cornell University psychology study in which doctors who cheered themselves up by eating candy before talking to patients were more productive and performed more accurate diagnoses and treatments. Even this little pick-me-up resulted in a marked performance improvement! In addition, we must realize that success does not come from planning; it comes from seizing opportunities when they appear. Clif Bar, one of the most successful powerbar brands is a case in point. The founder, Gary Erickson, didn’t start the brand thanks to careful planning; the idea came to him one time after cycling when he felt sick from eating other powerbars. He decided to take action, and designed more flavorful, natural ones that became a huge hit. So stop waiting for things to be better. Go create something better, instead! Of course, we all want to have more fun. But how does fun lead to success? For starters, seeking out activities that we feel we will enjoy can open up new opportunities. For example, one of the author’s clients, Madison, previously worked as a legal assistant in a biotech firm, not enjoying the job at all. After consultation with the author, she felt prompted to draw more fun activities into her life. Since she loved acting, she decided to open a drama club and help students. She finally quit her dreadful day job, and reported that the new experience had made her a happier, more creative person. So, by looking for more fun in her life, Madison actually became more successful. However, to reap the full benefits that new experiences offer, you need to ensure that the amount of fun in your life outweighs the negatives. Psychologists have discovered that you should have at least a 3:1 ratio in happy vs. unhappy experiences. The positives don’t need to be huge; you can simply take a long walk with your friend or enjoy a nice cup of hot chocolate by the fireplace to draw in positivity. One way to help you discover what you enjoy is to make a fun map of all the places you frequent. Then, make a list of these places and rate them by level of enjoyment. Based on the results, try to avoid places where you feel the least happy, like on the train to work or in your poorly lit office. This way, you can start seeking out activities and places you enjoy. In summary, having fun isn’t difficult, but many people feel too scared to make the effort. Don’t be one of them. Make the leap of faith to the fun side of life! So, now we know that having more fun in life usually leads to success. However, there is one exception to that statement: failing. Most people don’t enjoy failure and try to avoid it, but, we should actually encourage it. Why? Trial and error, and the failed attempts that inevitably result, often lead to swift improvements in your skills.   For example, one ceramics teacher conducted a study in which he divided his students into two groups. He asked one group to design the best pots it could in a set timeframe, and the second to construct as many pots as possible in the same time. In the end, the best pots actually came from the group focused on quantity, not quality. Why? Because, every time this group produced a pot, it picked out the mistakes and corrected them. The quality group had no failures to learn from, so it never improved. Also, many companies and individuals have used failure to launch themselves to prosperity. For example, comedians such as Chris Rock always perform in front of small audiences before presenting their routines on tour or for a bigger live audience. This way, they can observe what jokes prompt laughter, and adjust their routines accordingly . Failure spawns individuals’ growth, but also company growth. When Starbucks founder Howard Schultz first launched his vision, no one visited his coffee shop because he used unconventional techniques to attract customers. From his attempts, he learned why customers didn’t flock to his business. For instance, the menus were all in Italian, a language hardly anyone in the U.S. spoke. So, he omitted them from his second attempt, the mighty Starbucks.   Try. Make mistakes. And learn from the failed attempts. Have you ever felt anxious about starting a new hobby like pick-up basketball or playing an instrument? Often, the reason we’re afraid of starting something new is that being a beginner necessarily involves being bad at something compared to more experienced people, and we don’t want to look bad. That mindset is extremely limiting. To turn it upside down, remember: First of all, fear of failure often single-handedly promises failure. Let’s say you want a promotion at work, but your fear of being refused keeps you from asking for it. This is the same as failure, and it was brought on solely by your fear of failure. As a result, you find yourself working a job you didn’t want while probably growing to despise whoever got the promotion you wanted. Or suppose you’re at a bar and want to approach someone you find attractive, but your fear of stammering holds you back. The result? You’ve failed even before trying! The point is for you to try. By stepping out of your comfort zone, you’ll learn a lot about yourself and what to do differently next time. For example, you might have finally taken a jab at martial arts after years of wanting to, but didn’t particularly enjoy people throwing you over their shoulders. Nevertheless, you went for it, created new experiences, met new people, and discovered more about yourself. Maybe you found that you like martial arts with less contact, which could lead to even more new experiences. In summary, instead of avoiding failure, welcome it. While some things don’t work out, you are missing out on unbelievable opportunities by not trying at all. Children are innately curious and as a result often bombard adults with questions like “Why is the sky blue?” “Why are polar bears white?” and “Why don’t we float into space?” This innocent curiosity leads to constant new discoveries that expand their understanding of the universe. Unfortunately, traditional schooling dims our naturally inquisitive disposition: we learn to only study correct answers to questions, not ask new ones. Because of this schooling, we continue to cultivate an attitude of fear about the world well into adulthood. We feel that nurturing our childlike imaginations won’t serve more important aspects of our lives, such as our careers, and instead many adopt the belief that curiosity is unnecessary. For example, a friend of the author had a longtime desire to learn guitar. Her ex-boyfriend even gifted one to her, and she became ecstatic once she discovered that she could learn how to play by watching YouTube videos. Soon after, though, the familiar insecurities took over: getting the hang of it would take years, and she might never develop a true talent, in which case all that time practicing would be wasted. Yet, she forgot that the first step of picking up the guitar and strumming didn’t have to mean a long-time commitment; she could have done it just out of curiosity. We need to quell these insecurities and embrace our curiosity, letting our inner child run free. Many creative minds like Steve Jobs advocated living life to the fullest. In addition to his infatuation with technology, Jobs also immersed himself in spirituality, art and culture. This diversity of experience allowed him and his creative teams to create sleek, innovative Mac computers that surpassed anyone’s wildest imagination. Like Jobs, let your curiosity take over and start questioning the world again. Asking “why” will help you grow as a person, no matter your age. While it’s important to strive for big dreams like starting your own business, it’s crucial to think big and act small. What does this mean? From a young age, we’re told that success comes from having ambitious goals. As children, our parents push us to aim for the top, like to earn the highest grades in school. However, this tendency could actually have harmful effects as you grow older. Take Allan, for example. He wanted to take control of his obesity at age 35 and decided to transform his sedentary lifestyle into an active one. His goal? To lose 30 pounds and run a marathon in the space of one year. He covered all the bases: bought a gym membership, added expensive workout clothes to his wardrobe, and worked out six days a week. Yet, after his first week, he felt like hell. His whole body ached, and he had gained two pounds rather than lost any weight. When work picked up, he quit his routine. Why did his lofty ambition fall flat? He bit off more than he could chew. Breaking up large goals into smaller milestones makes them easier to achieve, because you can stay motivated as you complete each small step. Going back to the Allan example, he could have eased into his exercise regimen to gradually transition into an active lifestyle, and then incorporate more challenging workouts later. By starting out slowly, he would not have burned out so fast in the beginning, and he would have also gained some satisfaction from seeing his progress as he achieved small goals. Instead of trying to achieve a big goal all at once, we should take it one step at a time. Would you get married to someone with whom you’d never been on a date? Probably not. The same goes for your career. Many people actually follow a prescribed career path they decided upon without trying it out first, and remain in jobs they hate against their better judgment. For example, the author met a young man who had spent a decade studying chemistry, and he detested his job. Yet, when he asked the man why he didn’t just do something he liked, he said that wasting ten years of education just to have an enjoyable job would be outlandish. Unfortunately, many people find themselves in that situation with that mindset. But, people have the ability to change at any point in time. We all constantly evolve and have multi-faceted personalities. By labeling people based on characteristics like rationality, people limit their possibilities and opportunities to develop new strengths. Why can’t a logical person become an amazing photographer instead of an unmotivated, subpar analyst? Why shouldn’t the artist from next door become a skilled surgeon known for creating revolutionary, innovative methods of treating cancer? Because we don’t know how we will like a job until we do it for a while, we should always give jobs a test run before dedicating ourselves to them. Let’s say you were fascinated by horses growing up. This doesn’t automatically have to lead to a career as a veterinarian. Maybe you accept an internship at some stables and find that you still admire horses, but aren’t drawn to working with them. If you don’t like the job, don’t be afraid to keep trying new things until you find one that makes you happy. Did you know that the people with whom you surround yourself have a huge influence on your behavior? For example, if you have a friend who smokes a lot, you’re more likely to pick up smoking. That associative effect is why you should cultivate an encouraging, supportive community. A strong, supportive community was behind Steve Jobs’ success. So instead of thinking in terms of networks, start thinking about communities. What does this mean? Business people frequently discuss their networks and the significant role they play in business. However, this implies that you should only contact these people when you need something from them. Instead, you should cultivate a community of people interdependent upon each other and built on reciprocation. So how can you commune instead of network? Just follow the tips below! If you want to develop a community, you first need to correspond with a wide variety of people you look up to and who will have a positive influence on your life. Let’s say you’re interested in human rights issues: seek out people who are involved in standing up for human rights and NGOs. They will share your vision and help you gain a new perspective. Or, maybe you want to run your own business in a more charitable way: connect with other compassionate people so you can better understand how to achieve your goal. Cultivate relationships with people who encourage you. Once you have established a supportive community, the people in it can help you solve any problems you may encounter. For example, if you need to design a new website for your business, you can search your community for people skilled in web design. Just remember to reciprocate if anyone ever needs your help. In conclusion, get out there and meet people from all walks of life. It will enrich your life and theirs. The key message in this book: No one likes to fail. But fear of failure can hold us back from amazing opportunities. Taking risks and learning from the inevitable failures along the way allows us to live much more rewarding lives. Actionable advice: Make a fun map. If you want to maximize the fun in your life, chart where you typically have the most fun, in addition to places of medium enjoyment, and your least favorite places. Then start frequenting the places you rated highest and minimizing trips to the lowest-rated places.

Behind this desire is an awareness that fascinating others is essential to attracting and persuading them. In other words, we know that fascination can help us get what we want. Author Sally Hogshead identifies the seven “triggers” of fascination – Lust, Mystique, Alarm, Prestige, Power, Vice and Trust – and explains that learning how to use these triggers is key to maximizing your fascination potential, and thus becoming more persuasive. It’s easier than you might first think, as each of us has the innate ability to be fascinating. And, perhaps surprisingly, we’re all using these triggers already, without even knowing it. In these blinks, you’ll read about how popular companies make use of fascination triggers. You’ll also find a three-step guide to adapting these triggers to support your company’s goals. Also in these eleven blinks, you’ll discover: which restaurant kicks out paying customers for ordering the “wrong” meal; how a secret recipe was instrumental to Coca-Cola’s success; why you often spend a silly amount of money on a single piece of clothing; and why a teenager might fear losing his driver’s license more than dying in a car crash. We’ve all been fascinated by something: a piece of music, a meteor shower, an intelligent and beautiful person. But what is fascination? To be fascinated can be defined as a moment of total fixation on a particular thing. Where, though, does fascination come from? And why do we experience it? Our capacity for fascination is a product of human evolution – put simply, it evolved to help our ancestors survive. Consider the rest of the animal kingdom. To survive, animals too have to fascinate and be fascinated. The peacock’s colorful fan is noticed and judged by the peahen, and the most impressive fan – the one which fascinates her – will belong to the peacock that will father her peachicks. A capacity for fascination is a trait that continues to play an important social role: it helps us to develop social ties. In a study, researchers showed babies a series of pictures, some of them depicting human faces. Interestingly, whenever a picture of a face came up, the baby stared at it much longer (up to twice as long) than at the other pictures. Why? We’re fascinated with faces at such a young age because it helps us to establish and develop close social bonds with others. However, our innate capacity for experiencing fascination is just one side of the story; we have also an inborn desire and ability to be fascinating ourselves. Just like the peacock, we desire and aim to attract others by fascinating them. Flirting, for example, is a universal and innate ability to fascinate others. It doesn’t matter which culture, language or religion we examine; everyone knows instinctively exactly how to fascinate, without needing to be taught. Yet, just because we all know how to be fascinating, this doesn’t mean that we always do it well! You can reach your full potential for fascination by learning about the seven triggers of fascination. You’re at a dinner party. As the evening winds down, you notice there’s one piece of chocolate left on the table. No one else seems to want it, but you don’t want to be the one to take it. Yet you can’t stop thinking about how the chocolate would taste, how it would feel as it melts on your tongue. What’s behind that craving? Lust. Lust is the anticipation of pleasure. What’s more, the feeling we get from this anticipation is often far stronger than that we feel when we actually fulfill our desire. In a study, researchers scanned the brains of monkeys while offering them a single grape. The researchers observed that when the monkeys spotted the grape, their brains showed increased stimulation. This stimulation increased further when the monkey held the grape. Yet when the monkey finally got to eat the grape, the stimulation decreased. The experience of consuming the grape wasn’t nearly as fascinating as was the anticipation of eating it. Clearly, lust is very powerful. It’s no surprise, then, that it can cause people to make irrational decisions – something which can be exploited by brands and companies. The reason that people will sometimes pay unreasonably high prices for clothing is that companies intentionally trigger lust with their products. They do this by investing these products with the promise of pleasure. For example, a jacket might be made from a soft material that’s very pleasant to touch. When shoppers notice this jacket in a store and then touch it, they experience pleasure. So even though the store might be filled with less expensive jackets, this particular jacket will fascinate the customer, prompting them to pull out their credit card and buy it. In short, lust causes us to ignore our inner rational voice and leads us to do things that normally we might not do. Whether we’re engrossed in a “whodunit” or scanning the morning headlines, an unsolved murder is something that captures our imagination. A lack of facts around a case prompts speculation, engaging your imagination and desire to figure out what might have occurred. But why does this happen? The answer is mystique – another of the seven triggers of fascination. Our fascination is triggered when we don’t know the answer to a particular question. Driven by the need to fill gaps in our understanding, we’ll then try to solve the problem or answer the question ourselves. Because this desire is extremely powerful, it can be exploited – for instance, by companies that construct entire marketing strategies based on mystique. Take, for example, Coca-Cola. For decades rumors and stories have spread about the secret formula of the company’s flagship soft drink. Even though fans of Coca-Cola really want to know what’s in it, the company refuses to reveal its secret – a strategy which makes the product fascinating to fans who cannot stop speculating about the secret recipe. For many companies, there are plenty of ways to maximize this sense of mystique – one of which is to limit access to a product or service in a way that makes people eager to know more about it. Take, for example, a restaurant in Los Angeles called Crustacean, which has become famous for its garlic crab dish. Indeed, people travel far and wide just to taste it for themselves. What is it that makes the dish so fascinating? Its mystique. The dish is prepared in a special kitchen that has been built inside the actual kitchen, and only a few chefs have access to it. This ensures that the preparation of the dish remains a secret to most people. Filling out a tax form isn’t the most enjoyable thing to do – which is precisely why so many people put it off until the last minute! However, when you realize that you have just two days left to file, that tax form and the task of completing it becomes instantly fascinating. Why? Because as soon as you feel the imminent threat of serious consequences, you become alarmed, and this triggers your sense of fascination. Sometimes, though, the threat which fascinates us most isn’t the most obvious; an alarm is triggered not by the biggest threat, but by the most relevant. Consider this example: To prevent teenagers from drinking and driving, an advertising campaign showed images of gruesome car accidents that occurred when the drivers involved were intoxicated. Though designed to scare teenaged drivers into staying sober behind the wheel, the campaign did not have the desired effect. Why? Because teenagers weren’t threatened (and thus not alarmed) by the possibility of dying. It simply wasn’t an issue in their lives. Once other campaigners noticed this, they launched a different campaign that focused on a far less obvious threat: if you drive while drunk, you’ll probably lose your license. Surprisingly, this alternative campaign was much more effective, as teenagers as a whole were far more concerned with losing their driving privileges than with the possibility of death or injury. So how do companies exploit the alarm trigger to increase sales? One tactic is to introduce the threat of an impending deadline. Say you’re watching a teleshopping channel, but aren’t too interested in what’s being sold. However, if the hosts inform you of an immediate deadline – “Our vacuum cleaners are incredibly popular, but hurry, there are only 50 left!” – this might trigger your fascination. Have you ever noticed how many popular magazines and TV shows feature vastly wealthy people with massive houses and wildly expensive sports cars? If so, you might also wonder why it is exactly that such shows and magazines are so incredibly popular. Their popularity is due to our fascination with prestige, or the desire to be “better” or seen as more valued than others in society. Prestige is a trigger which causes us to act irrationally in our pursuit of higher social status, a fact that companies are always ready to exploit. One way that companies do this is by limiting the availability of products to increase their desirability, thus making them luxury items. Indeed, “quality over quantity” is the rule when it comes to prestige, as employing this trigger puts your products out of many customers’ reach. Consider what it is that makes a Michael Kors purse so much more prestigious and desirable than one you can buy from H&M. The answer is expense: the price of a Kors purse means that most people simply cannot afford it. But if you happen to be part of the minority who can afford the product, owning that purse would result in you feeling you have a higher status than the countless others who don’t own one. Another way for companies to employ the prestige trigger is to use brand emblems or symbols on products. This enables customers to publicly display their commitment to a brand and in turn the prestige of owning such a product – as with designer clothing that has the designer’s label clearly displayed. This tactic is also used by companies aiming to encourage their own employees’ commitment to the brand. The cosmetics brand Mary Kay allows top-performing employees to drive a pink Cadillac – a prestigious status symbol that strengthens an employee’s commitment to the company. This increased commitment is due to the pride that a top employee feels at having performed so well. Also, such a tactic provides potential employees with the incentive to join a particular company. In this way, the prestige of being one of the few who get to drive a pink Cadillac triggers fascination in workers who want to attain that high status for themselves. For millennia, power has triggered our fascination: philosophers spend time trying to define it, and governments spend money and energy finding ways to monopolize it. But we don’t have to think of power in such grand terms. Instead, we can use the word to refer to any attempt to control someone else. With this, a dictatorship that limits its citizens’ right to free assembly exists on the same spectrum as parents who limit their teenager’s access to the family car. It should thus not be surprising that companies are more than happy to use the power trigger to persuade you to purchase products. Companies can actually make themselves appear powerful to fascinate potential customers. For example, in one restaurant in Los Angeles, staff will sometimes yell at a customer for making the “wrong” choice when ordering – or even kick them out of the restaurant entirely! While such an approach might seem strange, it actually works. Customers keep coming back for more because they’re fascinated by the restaurant’s sensibility and its unconventional use of power. However, using power as a trigger for fascination doesn’t necessarily mean dominating others. There are other, more subtle ways to demonstrate power. For instance, you could control certain aspects of the environment, to ensure that the focus is solely on you. Imagine you’re a CEO, and you’ve noticed that employees aren’t focused enough during meetings. How could you employ the power trigger to change this? One way would be to ensure that all attendees have comfortable chairs, so that they don’t become restless. Another is to eliminate any noise outside the meeting room, to prevent any distractions while the meeting is underway. As this shows, you don’t need to use the power trigger at its extreme, as subtle changes too can have a big influence on your power to fascinate. In the 1920s, the United States government enacted Prohibition, making alcohol illegal to consume or sell. Was this move effective in dulling people’s desire to drink alcohol, to make it less fascinating? Certainly not! In fact, during Prohibition, the consumption of alcoholic beverages actually increased. Prohibition is a great example of the vice trigger, which illustrates that forbidden things fascinate us the most – a fact that successful companies know all too well. Indeed, a great way to make people desire something is to forbid it, or add a forbidden aspect to it. For example, imagine you’re in a room with another person and a plain, black box. The other person says that she has to leave the room for a while, and as she exits, she tells you not to open the box. Even though you’ve been told not to, odds are you’ll give into temptation and open the box anyway, because you wonder what is it that you’re not supposed to see. Companies can use our desire for breaking the rules to their advantage. Imagine that a certain headphone set has a “secret” volume setting, which enables you to increase the loudness of your music beyond an official set limit. Despite that doing this would probably damage your hearing, you’d most likely find it hard to resist the temptation to crank the volume, as the idea of doing something forbidden is fascinating to you. Another way to employ the vice trigger is to behave contrary to expectations. In 1982, a contest was held in Vietnam to find the best design idea for a war memorial. At that time, war memorials in Vietnam were always completely white. The young student who won the contest designed instead a huge black memorial. Because her entry was unconventional, it fascinated the judges. So even though when you play with others’ expectations you risk causing public outrage, it’s definitely one way to get everybody talking about you, and stimulate their fascination with you or your company. What’s the secret to the global popularity of McDonald’s, Burger King, Starbucks and so on? In a word, trust – the last of the seven triggers of fascination which we’ll examine. Along with trust comes the comforting feeling of familiarity. How do companies like McDonald’s earn the trust of millions of customers all over the world? They earn that trust and feeling of familiarity through repetition and consistency. Imagine you find yourself in an unfamiliar town, at night, after a long, tiring drive. You’re famished but because you don’t know where you are, you’re unsure of which restaurant to choose. Suddenly you notice the logo of a familiar fast food franchise, and you know immediately where you’re going to eat. In a study, researchers observed children as they ate chicken nuggets. The trick? One set of nuggets was wrapped in plain packaging while another was wrapped in McDonald’s branded packaging. The two sets of nuggets were identical, yet the children rated the ones wrapped in McDonald’s packaging more highly. They believed that the nuggets tasted much better, simply because they trusted McDonald’s food to taste good. However, companies sometimes lose their customers’ trust. If this happens, whatever the cause, you must ensure that you quickly get that trust back. Establishing trust is something that takes time, but losing it can happen almost overnight. If this happens, then it is important to immediately find a solution. Take the juice company Odwalla. Odwalla established trust with customers through the taste of their natural juices, by ensuring that the flavors of their juices weren’t dulled by the pasteurization process. However, the absence of pasteurization meant that the possibility of bacteria contaminating the juice was always there. And so a batch of juice was eventually contaminated, and a young girl died. The company had a big problem. On the one hand, they had to ensure that such a tragedy would never happen again. But on the other, they couldn’t compromise on the promise of unadulterated taste. The company’s solution? Odwalla invented a new method of pasteurization that maintained the flavor of their juice while also offering increased safety for their customers, which ensured that the company regained customers’ trust. Now that you’ve learned about the seven triggers and how they can be used to improve a company’s reputation, you’re probably eager to try them out for yourself. There are three steps necessary in the process of making your company more fascinating: Evaluation, Development and Execution. Let’s take a look at the first step – evaluation – which is a fundamental step toward assessing your current level of fascination. Evaluation involves considering whether and how your customers talk with others about your company. Think about what distinguishes your company from other, similar ones. Are your customers given the opportunity to participate and connect with your brand, for example? This last point is crucial, as customers’ fascination with a company increases as they get to interact with it. Take, for example, a whisky company, which gave its customers the possibility of having their own personal barrel. They would then receive updates, photos and samples from the barrel, which fascinated the customers and gave them a sense of membership and belonging. By surveying the successful strategies of other companies, you might be able to come up with a strategy of your own. Evaluation also involves identifying the fascination trigger that your company activates the most. As we’ve learned in previous blinks, we all have an innate ability to be fascinating; we’re all already using the seven triggers. But the key to success is using them in the right way. To ensure you achieve the results you want, you first have to find out which of the seven triggers is your primary trigger. Let’s take a look at Disney World Theme Parks. Entering Disney World gives people a familiar feeling; they know exactly what to expect from their upcoming experience. This suggests that the main trigger activated by Disney World is trust. What’s your primary trigger? Now that you’ve discovered your current level of fascination, it’s time to develop ideas that will make you even more fascinating. This part of the process is a creative one, in that you are aiming to find the perfect combination of triggers to increase your fascination. First, consider all seven triggers and brainstorm specific ideas on how to make them work for your company. Even though it may not seem that every trigger is appropriate for your company, you should evaluate them all to ensure that no opportunity is missed. Then, consider what makes your company interesting to people. Is it the history behind it? Or perhaps its core values are what draw people to it? Nike, for example, decided that a trivial fact about its company’s history might fascinate potential customers: on its business cards is an image of a waffle iron. Why? The image refers to an amusing story about the company’s history, in which Nike’s founder poured rubber into a waffle iron, thereby inventing Nike’s signature racer sole design! Nike’s waffle iron image generates mystique, as people are always curious about stories and myths. However, employing not just one but several triggers will further increase your potential for fascination. For instance, it can be a great idea to support your main fascination trigger with another trigger. Let’s take another look at Disney World. As we’ve seen, its main trigger is trust. However, the allure of Disney World is also based on its mystique. As we’ve seen in the Nike example, one of the foundations of mystique is story. There are so many stories associated with Disney that people will always use their imagination and be excited to explore new things when they visit Disney World. At this point, having discovered your most effective triggers and developed some great ideas for combining them, you now know exactly how to use your strengths to become as fascinating as possible. There’s just one final thing for you to do: bring those ideas to life! First, convince others of their merit toward your common goal. It’s essential that you get your team to support your ideas, as doing it alone is rarely as effective. To ensure that your team members will be convinced by your concept, you must be as concrete as possible in your presentation. Don’t hold back: demonstrate that you’ve considered your idea in depth and from many different angles. A great way to eliminate any doubt within your team is to create a project timeline, or an estimation of costs. Another way to persuade your colleagues, your boss or your clients is to show them examples of similar concepts which have already successfully increased another company’s fascination level. You’ve already seen plenty of examples in these blinks. You could even present studies that prove your ideas are reasonable. Once you’ve gotten the support you need, you can begin to execute your idea. But how will you know whether the idea is a success? Be sure to choose specific goals, as these enable you to measure your progress effectively. Establishing specific goals, instead of general ones, is the best way to check whether the fascination level of your company is increasing. For example, rather than looking for an increase in general awareness, try looking for more specific, detailed mentions of your company on Twitter. Setting yourself and your company smaller, more specific goals will enable you to adjust your concept whenever necessary. The key message in this book: Each of us has an innate ability to be fascinating. By using the seven triggers of fascination, you or your company can fulfill your potential for fascination. Actionable advice: To trigger fascination for something, make it a vice. Forbidding people to do or have a particular thing is a surefire way to stimulate their desire to have exactly that thing. This is the vice trigger. So if you want to persuade an individual to do something for you, don’t ask them directly. Instead, skirt around the subject at first, then ultimately reveal what it is that you need. Then forbid them to do it! At the very least, they’ll be tempted.

You are special not only because of your unique thoughts but also because of your biology and your environment. First of all, you are the first person ever to be born with your exact genetic makeup. Throughout the entirety of human evolution, there have been billions of different genetic permutations that have produced billions of different humans. In this unimaginably long genetic history, you are the first instance of your specific combination of genes. This makes you unique biologically, but also psychologically, because the makeup of your brain is also completely new and unique. In fact, scientists have found that vast psychological and biological differences can even occur between identical twins. A second factor that makes you unique is the environment you grew up in. You were born into a certain time period (which will never be repeated), and you've been a part of several groups and communities that will never exist again quite as they were: the people in your neighborhood, your family, your school class, etc. Our environments shape us tremendously, and only you have experienced your exact cocktail of environments, which will never influence another person in exactly the same way again. So appreciate how unique your life is, both socially and biologically. Your exact experience has never existed in human history, and it will not exist again. You were born with an entirely unique biological makeup, and entered into entirely unique social circumstances. This results in a life experience that can never be recreated. Have you ever felt pressured to live your life in a certain way? Society often encourages us to follow a certain linear plan. We're supposed to graduate high school at 18, enter university, and then become a professional person, get married and have children. This narrative may work for some people, but for many of us it can be limiting and steer us away from opportunities in which we might excel. We often have to commit to forming this plan at a very young age. Teenagers are expected to enter a specialization in university and then base their career off that decision. This means that many young people commit to a general plan of their entire career when they've only just finished their childhoods. Planning our lives when we're so young certainly doesn't leave much room for unexpected opportunities, and yet life is full of the unexpected. You have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow, but that isn't a bad thing. You might find something that will lead to an opportunity you never expected. Rather than fearing the unpredictability of the world, use it to your advantage. Unknown situations may lead to something amazing. When you accept that you can't predict or control the future, you'll discover many new opportunities. Ken Robinson's own life illustrates this well. As a child he became interested in theatre and stage direction, then later in drama education, and through that, education reform. He only began to write and give speeches in his middle age. As a young adult, he never planned to make most of his career outside England or become known for his writing and speeches. His greatest work resulted from seizing opportunities even when he didn't know where they'd lead. In short, don't be afraid of the unknown, because everything is unknown. Human intelligence is extremely vast, and every one of us is born with aptitudes for different skills – this is part of what makes each of us unique. Although you were born with many aptitudes, your environment or culture may have prevented you from discovering them: if you've never been to the sea, you have no idea whether you have an aptitude for sailing. Similarly, you might not have had the resources to uncover your aptitudes. For example, the El Sistema school opened to teach classical music to kids living in the dangerous parts of Venezuela, among horrific violence and political strife. The school became widely successful, and many of the kids excelled and went on to pursue professional careers in music. They never would have realized their talent if they hadn't had that school. The social values of your culture may also prevent you from discovering your aptitudes. Examine your assumptions about what you've been told are “acceptable aptitudes” for you based on your gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Your cultural values might dictate that it’s inappropriate for women to be passionate about engineering or for men to be passionate about cooking. If you are a woman with an aptitude for engineering in such a culture, you might not have been able to pursue this interest as a child, and may never even discover this aptitude unless you go against the cultural norms. Because you need opportunities to discover your aptitudes, try to create as many new opportunities for yourself as possible. Push yourself out of your comfort zone. Take courses on subjects you're curious about but have never studied. Meet new people. Travel. You have no idea what aptitudes you have that are undiscovered. The more new situations you expose yourself to, the more opportunities you have to discover unknown aptitudes.   If you ask people what's the best way to determine someone's intelligence, most would probably suggest giving them an IQ test or asking about their grades from school. But these standardized tests only measure only one kind of human intelligence: logical reasoning. In fact, there are many other ways to be intelligent that most schools don't value. If you were intelligent in these other ways, your school probably did not support you. For example, schools give a very low priority to skills dependent on using your hands. If you showed promise as a mechanic, your school might have tried to redirect you to something they consider more “professional,” such as law or medicine (even though mechanics are very intelligent, just in a different way). Moreover, schools cater to only a few learning styles. Schools generally make students learn through texts, but some people learn better in more abstract ways, such as through visual imagery. The famous composer Hans Zimmer did very poorly in school. It was only when he started to learn music by understanding it visually that he excelled. He understands music by visualizing it as repeated patterns, though no teachers ever taught it to him in this way. Finally, schools discourage children from exploring challenging subjects by punishing their mistakes. For example, in a math quiz, points are deducted for mistakes. This leads students to try to steer away from the subject in question. What’s more, as we grow up, we are conditioned to avoid mistakes, and thus we become less creative. So, don't assume you are bad at something because you performed poorly in that subject in school. Examine it again and ask yourself this: Are you certain you are bad at this subject? How do you know? These are areas you may want to explore. Many things can hold us back from realizing our true potential. Often our environment prevents it, but sometimes we limit ourselves with our own attitude. First off, you may have internalized a pessimistic attitude about your abilities. This feeling is often fostered by society. As we grow up, we're constantly encouraged to compete with each other – in schools and in our workplaces. This means you might have abandoned some talents because you felt you couldn't compete. For example, you might have shown promise as a guitar player, but abandoned it because you felt you would never be as good as Jimi Hendrix. We are also often encouraged to have a pessimistic attitude about developing our abilities. One key determinant to your thinking here is whether you have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. A fixed mindset means you believe your abilities are inborn and that therefore you can never improve on them, whereas a growth mindset means you believe you have the power to develop your abilities through practice. Society often encourages us to have a fixed mindset by emphasizing concepts like IQ: we are made to believe that we are born with a certain IQ and that we are fated to have this IQ for the rest of our lives, when in reality studying can very much improve our intellectual capabilities (and even our performance on such tests). You need to strive to have a growth mindset, as it will allow you to develop and improve your abilities. To understand yourself better, you might find it useful to take some personality assessment tests. They can never definitively describe your personality, but they might provide you with some new ideas you can use to reorient yourself and your goals. One common test people use is the Myers-Briggs test (MBTI), which can be taken online. Having passions is an essential part of being human, and all people are passionate about something. If you feel like you don’t have any passions, it is probably because you haven’t discovered them yet. When you're doing something that you feel passionate about, you should know it intuitively because you kind of “lose yourself” in it. This is why people often describe a change in their perception of time when they are doing something they are passionate about. Musicians often spend hours rehearsing or writing music without noticing the passing time. Ask yourself, what in your life makes you feel this way? The positive mental feeling you get when you're immersed in your passions affects your physical well-being too. The Harvard Study of Adult Development has studied extensively the connection between positive emotions and health. Experiencing positive emotions has been proven to reduce stress, reduce chronic pain and addictions, and improve sleep and concentration, among many other positive benefits. Passions are an important and intrinsic part of every person, so you should create opportunities to allow yourself to discover them. The more opportunities you give yourself to discover your passions, the happier and healthier you will become. Explore new physical and social environments, and research new fields you aren't familiar with but are curious about; for example, by taking classes, joining relevant book groups or finding online communities. Look into new physical activities like sports or learn a craft that requires skilled use of your hands. The more unknown situations you explore, the more room you have to discover unknown passions. Most people would agree that happiness is very personal. Despite this seemingly obvious fact, we are constantly told by society that there are two correct ways to achieve happiness: wealth and immediate gratification. This can be very damaging and may prevent us from finding more meaningful ways to be happy. First of all, we're constantly told that happiness is dependent on making more money. This is simply untrue. Depression rates are far higher in wealthier countries. Money can sometimes help you deal with a situation, but if you feel unfulfilled in life, having more money will not necessarily help. It's also okay if you can’t turn your passions and talents into your profession. Instead, learn how to adjust your schedule to still allow time for them. For example, if your passion is painting with watercolors, you don't have to refocus your whole career on this. Rather, arrange your schedule to allow yourself to paint, even if only for a few hours a week. This can make a big difference in your well-being. It's also common that people seek happiness only through short-term satisfaction. Many fall into a vicious cycle where they are miserable at work, and work only to earn money to buy themselves distractions from their jobs (like nights out or vacations). Long-term satisfaction is much more meaningful, so try instead to invest your time in long-term projects you enjoy, such as creating or building things. In contrast to the fleeting rewards (like a night out might provide), creating something like a novel or a piece of furniture will constantly provide new challenges and small successes, and will feel even more rewarding as the creation process goes on. For many people, their greatest happiness comes from helping others, so look into this if you haven't already. Volunteering or getting involved in projects that help other people or your community doesn't just benefit others – you may find it brings you a deeper kind of happiness too. Your passions are your own, but it’s often very beneficial to pursue them with other people. Finding people who share your passions can lead to new opportunities to fulfill your goals. Let's say you're passionate about do-it-yourself electronics. You could benefit enormously by sharing ideas and working together with people from different areas of specialization within that field. The “Maker” community has sprung up for exactly this purpose, with its own magazine and conferences. Through these mediums, DIY enthusiasts are able to share ideas and advice to the benefit of everyone. When you work in a community of like-minded people, you'll find others whose ideas you can learn from. They can teach you new skills relevant to your goals and help you to better realize your ideas, and of course you can share your knowledge and help them in return. Sometimes working with others is not only beneficial, it’s actually necessary. Some goals can only be achieved in large groups. Don't pressure yourself into thinking you should achieve your goals alone, because that's often unrealistic. A good example of this is “The New Nordic Cuisine Movement,” which has become popular in Europe in the last several years. It started as a group of chefs in Scandinavia who wanted to promote traditional Nordic food, although this particular cuisine rarely gets international attention. They organized a network of participating restaurants, recruited interested chefs, and successfully increased the popularity of Nordic food throughout Europe. Obviously, no individual chef or restaurant could have managed this alone. Finding a group of people who share your passions can be very beneficial or even necessary for both you and other members of the group. The key message of this book is: Allowing yourself time for your natural talents, passions and creativity is the key to achieving inner happiness and satisfaction, so let yourself explore those things as much as possible. Actionable ideas from this book in blinks: When trying to discover your hidden talents, look back at things your teachers said you were bad at. Institutional education very often fails people, for two important reasons: schools only value a select few kinds of intelligence, and they only cater to a select few kinds of learning styles. Human intelligence is impossibly varied, and yet schools expect all students to excel in the same system. Through a drawn-out process of stigmatizing mistakes and delivering information in the same boring ways over and over again, children are conditioned out of their creativity and turned away from any fields they struggle with. If you did poorly in something in school, it’s likely that this was because the school failed you, not because you failed. Look back at what your teachers made you believe you were bad at; you may be surprised to discover you have hidden talents there. Don't fear unpredictability – use it to your advantage. Most people feel uncomfortable in situations where they don't know what's going to happen, but no one has any idea of what the future may bring. You may have a plan, but you have no idea of what's actually going to happen the next time you set foot outside your house. Rather than being scared of that, embrace it, because any unknown part of your life could potentially lead to something great. Push yourself out of your comfort zone and into as many unknown situations as you can (while remaining physically safe, of course). An amazing opportunity could be lurking anywhere.  Suggested further reading: Talent is Overrated by Geoff Colvin Talent is Overrated explores the top performers in a number of fields to get at the bottom of just what makes them great.

Or you’re ten weeks into your new three-month fitness program. But you just. Can’t. Finish. Are you lazy? Incompetent? Simply doomed? No. You just haven’t identified your true enemy yet: perfectionism. And that’s where these blinks come in. Here, you will learn all about perfectionism, how it stunts your progress and how you can push back against it to finally finish those long-overdue projects and bring your dreams that much closer to reality. You’ll also learn why perfectionism is like the cuckoo bird; how fear can make things fun; and why you should sometimes choose to be bad at stuff. We’ve all been there: you start an exciting new project, but somewhere along the line, it stalls and remains unfinished. Our excuses are always the same, as we’ll tell ourselves or others that “life just got in the way,” or “I was never able to get back on track.” But if we’re being truthful, a more accurate explanation is “I quit once it stopped being perfect,” because the real roadblock to finishing our projects is perfectionism. Any plan can be ruined by perfectionism. Once, the author, Jon Acuff, began a new year with an ambitious new exercise regime. It started off perfectly, with over 70 miles run in the months of February, March and April. But then came May, and he only completed eight miles, followed by June, with only three. With his excellent streak ruined, Acuff gave up. Acuff had the same thought a lot of us have: “If it’s not perfect, then it’s not worth doing.” But this is dangerous thinking, because nothing in life is perfect and no one should go around thinking everything will go their way. If we limit ourselves to perfect work, we’d never accomplish anything! Instead, it’s best to expect imperfection and understand that when it arrives, the real work begins. It’s normal for imperfection to arrive first thing on Monday morning. Before you even sit down at your desk, there may well be multiple problems that need fixing. How you deal with these imperfections, and how you proceed once they arrive, is what determines your success in meeting goals. In fact, it’s the actions on the day after something went wrong that separate the quitters from the achievers. Did you skip the gym and sleep in instead? Did your diet go out the window after you devoured a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts one afternoon? The day after imperfections like these are when you need to accept that life is messy, and push on with your goals. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that excellence can only be achieved through perfection when, in reality, perfectionism is the killer of excellence. Perfectionism isn’t the only roadblock to finishing; we also make things difficult by creating overly ambitious goals. When Jon Acuff was a college freshman, he dreamed of being a field-goal kicker for his college football team – this despite the fact that he was short, out of shape and had never kicked a field goal in his life. So it’s no surprise that Acuff failed to turn this dream into a reality. While this example might seem frivolous, most people do set goals that are unrealistic. Scientists refer to this excessively optimistic thinking as planning fallacy, and it’s the main reason current statistics say that 92 percent of us fail to achieve our goals. The concept of planning fallacy was pioneered by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. They found that people typically reveal a bias toward optimism by constantly underestimating how much time a task will take to complete. For example, one psychologist asked his students to predict how long it would take them to complete their thesis papers. On average, students estimated they would need 34 days to finish, but the reality was an average of 56 days – nearly double their estimates! A reliable way to avoid both planning fallacy and perfectionism is to cut your goal in half. This will greatly reduce the chance of quitting due to being overwhelmed or biting off more than you can chew. The author runs a “30 Days of Hustle” program, which is designed to help people set and achieve goals, and on the ninth day of the program, he asks everyone to cut their goals in half. By doing so, participants routinely find their performances go up by an average of 63 percent, and 90 percent of the participants report feeling more motivated, since their goal suddenly feels more attainable. So with this technique alone, you can stop falling short and start finishing what you’ve started. No one enjoys producing bad work, but sometimes letting yourself be lousy at one thing allows you to finish more important work. In the author’s case it was his front yard, which was an unruly, overgrown mess that was being taken over by weeds. He could have taken on the chore of cleaning it up and making it look good, but it would have required a lot of time and effort, two things he needed to reserve for his kids. This brings us to the next pitfall of productivity: thinking that we need to be great at everything, when in fact it’s beneficial to be bad at some things. While Acuff was bad at gardening, he could rest easy in knowing he was being a good dad. Our optimistic and perfectionist streaks will try to convince us that every single task and chore can be taken care of, without a problem. But this is just another way of setting unrealistic goals. Instead, you need to practice strategic incompetence; admit that you don’t have time to do everything and let things go, or give it the minimum amount of effort required. While Acuff was finishing his new book, he had to use strategic incompetence when answering his e-mails. There was no way he could answer them all and finish the book, so he decided to limit himself to dealing with 10 percent of his inbox. Obviously, there are some chores we can’t ignore, but many of these can be simplified such that they don’t interfere with the more important stuff. One of the author’s friends is Lisa, a goal-oriented mom who gets a lot done by simplifying chores like doing the laundry. Sometimes, getting the clothes washed and dried is enough, and her family have to get by with wrinkly clothes, since there just isn’t enough time for ironing and folding. Luckily, there’s plenty of help these days with simplifying, as apps and online services can help us take care of things like shopping and banking. When you think of the word “goal,” do you associate it with enjoyment? Or do words like, “pain,” “discipline” and “grind” sound more appropriate? You would certainly be better off enjoying the work you do, since you’re more likely to achieve your goals if they involve something you like doing. This is something many people discover when they take on a goal like exercising more. They might start jogging for a couple weeks, but will then quit because they never asked themselves, “Do I enjoy running?” This kind of question is extremely important, as researchers have found that the two decisive factors in setting a goal are satisfaction and performance success. These refer to how satisfying you find the work itself, and what it is you’re actually achieving. So, when your ultimate goal and the work it requires are two things you really enjoy, you have a recipe for success. During his “30 Days of Hustle” programs, the author found that when participants had a goal involving work they found satisfying, their performance went up by an average of 31 percent. And when they chose an enjoyable goal, this increased their performance by another 46 percent! Another way to look at this is through a simple equation: fun = success. We don’t always get to pick our goals, but we can often turn them into work that is fun. Let’s say a person’s goal is to lose weight. Now, a goal like this can either be motivated by fear, which isn’t fun, or reward, which can certainly be fun. You can think up prizes to add at the end of every week when short-term goals are reached, like taking a long lunch on Friday and going to see a movie. Deadlines can also be turned into a fun motivator. A lot of people dread deadlines, but they also provide a certain rush. So, instead of one monthly or weekly deadline, you can set up multiple deadlines every day to get that recurring thrill that keeps you going. Are you familiar with the deceptive tricks of the cuckoo bird? It’s a unique bird in that it manages to lay its eggs in the nests of other species, tricking the other birds into feeding and raising its young. This is very similar to the deception that perfectionism plays as it nests in our minds and tricks us into thinking things that aren’t true. One of the biggest lies related to perfectionism is that perfection is attainable if we follow certain rules. Now, these rules can vary from person to person, and they can make it impossible for people to finish their projects, so it’s helpful to figure out your own perfectionist rule. A couple of the author’s classic perfectionist rules are, “If something is easy, it can’t be worth doing,” and “If it’s not successful in ten days, it’s a failure.” He identified this second rule in 2008, after he experienced some early success in writing a blog. The immediacy of the positive feedback made him think that if good results didn’t come within ten days, a project was a failure. Not surprisingly, this rule made him quit a number of projects far too early. Often, we aren’t conscious about how we follow these rules, but they can be identified if we stop and question our motivations. When the author was speaking with a woman trying to lose weight, she thought her perfectionist rule was to get down to a particular number on the scale; if she didn’t hit this number, she wasn’t successful. The woman believed that since this unrealistic goal had become her primary motivation, she was having problems reaching her goal. But then she asked herself the one question everyone should ask themselves: “What do I really want?” Once she did this, she realized that her real motivation had nothing to do with attaining the perfect weight; rather, behind her desire to lose weight was a will to be healthy and avoid heart disease and diabetes. Upon making this realization, she could finally take the focus away from perfectionism and start getting good results. It’s not a coincidence that “cuckoo” is synonymous with “crazy;” these perfectionist rules will drive you nuts if you let them. Let’s say you’ve begun work on a new project and you’ve done everything right so far. You’re doing something you enjoy and find satisfying, you’ve accepted the imperfections, you’ve cut your goals in half and have overcome your perfectionist rules. If you’ve gotten this far, you might think it’s smooth sailing from here, right? Not so fast. Perfectionism will strike once more, on the day before done. One of the tricks of perfectionism is to think ahead to “what-if” scenarios, and as the finish line draws near, these thoughts can turn to fears that will cause you to stumble right before the end. If you’re writing a book, you might be nearing the end and start thinking, “What if the critics hate it? What if no one buys it?” The easiest way to avoid frightening scenarios is to just ditch the work and start something else. After all, critics can’t criticize something that is never published! But if you do this, you’re bound to be bitter and hard on yourself for giving in to your fears. As the legendary author Stephen King once said, “People are extremely hard to live with when they have a talent they aren’t able to use.” So, instead of playing “what-if” games, see what happens – and don’t waste time and energy worrying about things that haven’t happened yet. You should also be honest with yourself about the reasons you have for dragging your feet on finally finishing a project. People can get comfortable when others see them as a martyr, selflessly putting their dreams on hold to care for their kids or someone else in their family. Be honest about your motivations, and if this kind of situation applies to you, it’s probably time to reassess your fears and rewards, so that you can give yourself that final push to finish. Remember, no external praise will compare to the personal joy and satisfaction you’ll get when you follow through and keep the promises you’ve made to yourself. The key message in this book: The main stumbling block that people encounter when they try to finish their projects is not laziness, but perfectionism. Perfectionism convinces us that anything less than perfect is a failure, and the only worthwhile goals are one that are grand and difficult – and make you miserable. If we accept that nothing will ever be perfect, we can start to enjoy the rewards of productivity and accomplishment. Actionable advice: Celebrate your imperfect progress by using data. Perfectionism constantly tells us that we’re failing as we progress toward our goal. You can combat this feeling by measuring your actual progress, instead of just relying on that vague voice of doubt in your head.

Our lives are filled with potential distractions: your smartphone, email, even your thoughts about where you’ll take your next vacation. As you let your attention become increasingly scattered by such distractions, you impair your ability to do your work on time and to do it well. Yet author Daniel Goleman goes beyond the narrow definition of “focus” to present a guidebook for living a focused life, according to which we can gain a richer, fuller existence by paying attention to ourselves, to others and to larger contexts, like our planet and the future. Drawing from a well of countless real-life examples, Focus provides many ways for the reader to enhance their level of attention, including practicing mindfulness, positive thinking and engaging in focused preparation. In these blinks you’ll learn why letting your mind wander can lead you to great insights but also hinder you in accomplishing your goals. You’ll find out why the best quality for a leader is not the ability to keep their eyes on the prize, but actually self-awareness or empathy. You’ll discover how to train your willpower like a muscle and how if you do something you love, seeing it through to completion requires much less effort. Finally, you’ll learn why when you’re stressed and can’t think straight, having a positive attitude will make a massive difference. Whenever you don’t check your email or phone for a while, do you find yourself fighting a remarkably strong urge to drop whatever you’re doing and take a peek? And if you do give in to the urge, do you feel somehow unsatisfied if there are no new messages waiting for you? We live in distracting times. The constant urge to respond to the overwhelming amount of information and stimuli in our environment leads us to a state of continuous partial attention in which we leap carelessly from one thing to another, from our phones to our email to Facebook and in doing so weaken our ability to select what we pay attention to. However, it is possible for us to focus, even when we’re surrounded by activity and stimuli. What we need is strong selective attention. Indeed, the stronger our ability to select what we focus on, the better we are at ignoring potential distractions. For example, journalists in an open-plan office at the New York Times manage to focus on their work and meet deadlines despite being surrounded by noise and other distractions. None of these journalists ever demand quiet so they can concentrate better. But not everyone’s selective attention is as strong. Most of us tend to daydream while we’re at work or distract ourselves with other time-wasting activities. For that reason, it’s crucial to increase our selective attention so we can ignore external distractions and accomplish our tasks. However, the distractions that engulf us not only threaten to waste our time and reduce our productivity, they also diminish our ability to immerse ourselves in a subject, reducing our chances of reaching a state of flow and thus learning and discovering new things. In fact, this issue is so prominent that internet addiction among young people has already been identified as a national health problem in many Asian countries. So if we can develop our ability to ignore distractions and focus well, we can help to increase our performance, and enable ourselves to have more profound reflections and deeper insights. Having the ability to focus is obviously an advantage, both in life and work, as it enables us to get into a flow state and perform better. But choosing to pay attention to one thing rather than another involves a push-pull process between the bottom-up and top-down minds. The bottom-up mind, responsible for our automatic and routine mental activity, is very fast, driven by our emotions, and impulsive. In contrast, the top-down mind, in charge of planning, reflection and learning new skills, is slower and requires voluntary attention and self-control. Those of us who rely on using our bottom-up minds are far more likely to lose focus and lose awareness of our immediate environment. For example, there was a time when you’d see long queues of people waiting to use the one photocopier in their office. One psychologist decided to ask a few people to jump to the front of the queue and announce, quite simply, that they needed to make some copies. Frequently, the person they asked would be “zoned out” from the tedious wait and would therefore let that person use the copier. Had that person at the head of the queue maintained active attention while they waited, they might have questioned the urgent request to jump the queue. Maintaining this kind of active attention also helps us to learn new skills. The myth of the “10,000 hour rule” is based on the notion that we can become experts at a particular task simply by performing it repeatedly. But this is not how we improve performance. Rather, we have to consciously adjust our execution continually. For example, if you’re a poor golfer, always making the same errors whenever you swing or putt, you won’t improve your game by spending thousands of hours repeating those mistakes. In other words, the difference between an expert and an amateur is that an expert will use the top-down mind to actively reflect on the automatic, bottom-up influence on their game, which enables them to continually improve their performance. It might not always be valuable to have a narrow focus or a goal-oriented type of attention. Sometimes it can be more effective to maintain an open awareness or mind-wandering. Rather than wandering away from what counts, we may well be wandering toward something valuable. This is because allowing our minds to wander provides fertile ground for serendipitous insights. It’s certainly a luxury to find a moment in the day when we’re alone and able to slow down and reflect. Yet such moments are extremely valuable, as they allow us to improve at tasks which depend on experiencing flashes of insight, like those which require quick, imaginative wordplay, or inventive and original thinking. In fact, people who are highly skilled at tasks which require an intense focus (like solving math problems) may find it challenging to switch off their minds and broaden their focus enough to generate creative insights. These people could follow the example of renowned cryptographer Peter Schweitzer: his work often required him to crack codes – an intensive mental task – yet he would do this while taking a walk or sunbathing. This kind of open awareness enables us to be creative, as it makes us completely receptive to new ideas. For that reason, open awareness is useful for imagining future scenarios, self-reflection, developing creative ideas and organizing our memories. In one experiment where participants were asked to come up with novel uses for a particular item, those participants who had allowed their minds to wander actually generated 40 percent more original ideas than those who were focused narrowly on the task. Moreover, people who maintain an open state of mind and have a strong disposition towards mind wandering include those with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and freestyle rappers, who improvise their lyrics spontaneously. The brains of both groups show a heightened level of activity in the circuitry that’s active while mind-wandering and it is this which enables them to make new connections between the distant areas of the brain. Accomplishing goals requires strong focus, motivation and determination – all qualities that constitute strong willpower. And the more challenging the goal, the more willpower we require. Our willpower plays a crucial role in determining the course of our lives. For example, it’s more probable that children who display a high level of willpower will become successful in their futures, compared to those who don’t show such self-control. In one major experiment, over 1,000 children took a series of tests that evaluated their capacity to handle frustration, restlessness, concentration and perseverance. Twenty years later, 96 percent of these children were located, and, then in their thirties, had their health, wealth and criminal record evaluated. The findings revealed that the better the person’s self-control in childhood, the more successful they were in their thirties. But self-control and willpower aren’t necessarily qualities you’re born with. They have to be developed throughout our childhood and even in adulthood. The most effective way to develop stronger willpower is to do what you love. This is because your willpower increases if your work reflects your personal values. Doing what you love motivates you to pursue your goals with determination, and the effort required seems worthwhile when you enjoy and care about the results of your work. However, many of us do work that isn’t in line with our values. We stick to the same safe routines – like the nine-to-five job – and so our work appears to require a huge personal effort. Consider George Lucas, for example. When he was making Star Wars, the extent of the movie director’s commitment t o his work and his personal creative vision led him to split from his production company and invest much of his own money into producing a movie that would be true to that vision. So rather than being accountable to a company that demanded changes that would compromise Lucas’s vision, he decided to take complete creative control in the belief that his vision was the right one. In order to have fulfilling interactions with others, we need to be empathetic, and empathy takes two main forms: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. Cognitive empathy is the kind that enables us to see the world through the eyes of others. It can help us to comprehend other people’s mental states and the ways in which they understand the world. However, while this empathy allows us to observe, for example, that someone is sad – say, if their loved one had died – it doesn’t allow us to feel what they feel. Cognitive empathy is the kind that psychopaths have: they’re able to see what others are feeling but they lack the ability to feel with them – which allows them to manipulate others for their own purposes. Emotional empathy, on the other hand, does enable us to feel what others are feeling. Moreover, this is actually a physical phenomenon, as we sense other people’s emotions within our own bodies. In one study, for example, the brains of subjects were imaged while they were watching other people receiving painful electric shocks, revealing that the subjects’ pain circuits were indeed activated. In other words, the subjects’ brains simulated the other people’s pain. However, while these types of empathy allow us to both see and feel what others are going through, they don’t necessarily lead us to becoming sympathetic – that is, having concern for other people’s well-being. Consider doctors, for example. Doctors who don’t express empathy with their patients are more likely to be sued if they make a mistake, in comparison with those who demonstrate an authentic interest in their patients’ problems. For an already distressed patient, having an unempathic doctor will only serve to increase their anxiety. Yet at the same time, people want a doctor who will help them to get well, not one who’ll break down in tears whenever they have a problem. The ideal balance is to have empathic concern or detached concern. People tend to focus on what’s happening in their immediate environment and to plan only for the near future. The problem with this approach is that they neglect to deal with distant threats which might have a significant impact in the long run. Yet this is part of our nature: distant threats simply don’t trigger the same sense of fear as more immediate ones like not being able to pay your rent, or getting into a heated argument with a loved one. Future problems are too abstract for us to act on – for example, the effects of climate change – since their consequences may or may not be experienced and are a long way off. But although the predisposition to focus on our immediate problems is innate, it’s nevertheless a serious problem, as ignoring the larger context can be detrimental in the future. For instance, our planet’s resources, like clean air and water, will eventually be depleted unless we decide to focus intensively on preserving them. But we have to do this in a way that takes the larger context into account, because when we try to solve a problem by focusing narrowly on short-term results, any relief we get from the problem is short term also, so the problem arises again – often with worse consequences than before. Consider, for example, the problem of traffic jams. One solution is simply to build more highways. However, because highways make it easier for us to get around, this encourages new stores to open and more people to spread throughout the area. The result is that the traffic actually continues to increase because there’s now more capacity for it. As this shows, focusing on the larger context of any given problem enables us to care not only for any immediate effects but also the distant future. It is this which will allow us to lead fulfilling lives in which we care and attend to our planet, saving it for future generations. When it comes to leading a successful organization, focus is crucial. The ability to move an organization’s focus to the right place at the right time depends on the leader’s level of self-awareness. While a high IQ score may land you the job, it’s not enough to make you an outstanding leader. Unless leaders have self-awareness, it’s unlikely they will make an inspiring leader. We’ve all heard tales of bosses who are very critical of employees and seem to enjoy pushing them past their natural limits. This attitude creates a toxic atmosphere as their narrow focus on the “prize” blinds them to how they’re affecting the people around them. Now consider a leader that pays attention to her team, praises their small wins, and often admits that there are tasks that she herself couldn’t perform. Such a leader has self-awareness – she knows her own limitations and is able to assemble a strong team that will compensate for such gaps. She trusts in the abilities of others and allows them to do their job in their own way. Another reason that focus is crucial to being an effective leader is that the more focused and clear a leader’s vision is, the more likely they are to convince others to believe in and work toward it. A great vision is central to any strong business plan, but bringing such a vision to reality requires a brilliant leader who is able to communicate it clearly to others and convince them it’s a worthwhile cause. For example, consider the fantastic and radical vision of the founder of the Singer sewing-machine company, Isaac Singer. In the nineteenth century the prevailing assumption was that housewives would not be able to operate mechanical contraptions like sewing machines, but Singer’s vision was that they could and would buy the machines. To convince people of his vision, Singer even extended credit to women to make it easy for them to purchase the machines. Indeed, the product’s success propelled the company to worldwide success. Rather than being overly focused on the “prize” and remaining ignorant of the impact they have on the people around them, inspiring leaders strive to empower others and contribute to their community. Of course, companies require their leaders to produce great results. But rather than simply instructing others to perform certain tasks, a good leader focuses on identifying and developing other people’s potential. For example, the company Ben & Jerry’s uses actual brownies for their Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream, which they source from Greyston Bakery, located in a very poor neighborhood of the Bronx. Greyston Bakery hires people who have a difficult time finding work. Their motto – “We don’t hire people to bake brownies. We bake brownies to hire people” – is a prime example of an inspired leader’s vision. In contrast, unempathic leaders are unable to see and manage the impact they have on others. For example, consider the first few weeks which followed the BP oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. While innumerable birds and animals were dying and the Gulf’s people were condemning the disaster, the CEO of BP, Tony Hayward, told the media “there is no one who wants this thing over more than I do. I’d like my life back.” When he should’ve been showing concern for the victims of the oil spill, Hayward was instead expressing how much it had inconvenienced him personally and took no responsibility. This behavior prompted a wave of antipathy towards Hayward and BP due to the CEO’s lack of awareness of his impact on others and of how the public now perceived the company. This is a classic case of what can happen when a leader can’t see how their actions affect others and what kind of reactions they generate. To be able to anticipate how others react to your actions, you need to first understand how they see you and this demands self-awareness on your part. Successful leaders lead with a focus on the future. To do this requires exploring the broader context in which their organization operates, as this enables them to identify opportunities for growth in the market. For example, Steve Jobs took the brave step of reorganizing Apple’s portfolio: rather than concentrating their efforts on many different products, Jobs decided that Apple should focus on just four computers – a desktop and a laptop, each for two markets: consumer and professional. On the other hand, unadventurous leaders who remain rigid in their focus on exploiting existing products and technologies end up as victims of their own narrow vision. One of the best examples of this is the smartphone company BlackBerry. By the mid-2000s, BlackBerry had become a favorite with corporate IT, but just five years later it lost 75 percent of its market value. Why? BlackBerry was slow to notice the burgeoning popularity of the iPhone and other touchscreen smartphones with which companies allowed their employees to connect to the corporate network. Also, the company overestimated the attraction of long battery life, failing to recognize that users were more than happy to sacrifice it for the use of a touchscreen. BlackBerry is a classic example of what can happen to an organization with a rigid, narrow focus. Because the company trained its focus squarely on the existing, established technology rather than exploring for the next big thing, what was once an innovative company fell behind and couldn’t keep up with the tech waves which followed. To avoid being blindsided by the competition, leaders should devote much of their attention to exploring new opportunities for development. Attention is not an innate gift that you do or do not have. Rather, it’s a kind of mental muscle – one that you can strengthen and grow by exercise. One way to do this is to learn to be aware of when your mind starts to wander and correct this by refocusing your attention on a given target. Training awareness in this way is the essence of one-pointed focus meditation, which involves focusing completely on one thing, such as your breathing. As you do this, you’ll notice that after a while your mind will probably begin to wander. But that’s OK. The main thing is that you’re aware of the wandering and that you refocus your attention onto your breath and keep it there. When you inevitably lose focus again, simply repeat the process. As with weight training, the more repetitions you perform, the more powerful the muscle gets. The key to training your attention is being able to maintain an awareness of your own mental processes – like noticing when your mind starts to drift away from the object of focus. This is called meta-awareness. This kind of meditation can greatly enhance your ability to disengage your focus from one thing and shift it onto another. As with practicing meta-awareness, meditation helps us to recognize when our minds begin to wander and strengthens our ability to focus on what’s important. So the next time you notice yourself procrastinating or compulsively checking your email, make sure you register it and return your focus to the task at hand. This will be a great help to you when you’re under stress. Most of us have experienced “freezing” in the middle of a test and thought to ourselves, “I can’t do this. My mind is blank.” In these moments, practicing meta-awareness enables you to notice that you’re anxious and to take certain steps to calm yourself down – for example, taking a slow, deep breath – before continuing with the test. Have you ever noticed that when you feel positive even the most difficult tasks seem much easier? Why is this? One reason is that having a positive outlook boosts our motivation. Indeed, when we’re in a positive frame of mind, the left prefrontal area is extremely active – that’s the part of the brain that contains the “reward circuitry” that’s rich with dopamine – so as we work we’re reminded of how we’ll feel when we finally succeed and accomplish a particular goal. This is what motivates, say, a graduate student to continue working late into the night to finish their dissertation. Another reason for the positive effect of a good mood is that our focus shapes our reality and this has important consequences for the way we handle big challenges. For instance, feeling positive opens our minds to experiencing new things and meeting new people. If you’ve ever thought about moving to a different city or country you’ll know that it’s a scary step to take. But a positive person who has a cheerful disposition will view it as an adventure full of exciting possibilities, as positive thinking enables that person to focus on the new experiences that being in a new city presents and thus to actually embrace the inevitable changes and deal better with setbacks. This argument applies equally to making plans for the future. You’re more likely to feel optimistic about your long-term goals if you focus on what you’d really enjoy doing, on what skills you still want to learn and on the strengths you’ve already developed. On the other hand, if you allow yourself to focus on your failings and shortcomings, and on the competition and difficulties you’re likely to face, the result will probably be that you’ll become demotivated and therefore not take even the first step. The key message in this book: Staying focused has a great impact on our performance and thus our ability to become successful. A focused life in which attention to ourselves, to others and to the larger context – like our planet – are key components leads to a fuller and richer every day experience. This is equally valid when applied to leadership, as the success of any organization depends on its leader’s ability to effectively capture and direct the attention of a collective. Actionable advice: Like a muscle, focused attention requires rest. While it’s true that we have to exercise our focus to keep it “healthy,” tightly focused attention inevitably becomes fatigued after a while. It’s easy to notice when this happens: you’ll find yourself staring at the words on the page, unable to make sense of something that should be simple, or you’ll notice that your mind keeps slipping from the task at hand. When this happens, it’s a clear sign that you need to give your focus a break. The most effective way to restore your attention is to switch from top-down to bottom-up control. In other words, allow your mind to wander and to make whatever associations it makes. After a while, it will become clear that you’re ready to return to top-down mode, and you’ll do so feeling refreshed and clear-headed.  Try to make the problems of the future more concrete. Because we’re wired to care more about immediate problems and issues than distant ones, we’re in danger of neglecting to prepare for potentially devastating future events. Yet it’s clear that making concrete plans about the very distant (and abstract) future feels unnatural to us. One way to make the future more concrete and immediate for yourself is to use your full attention in imagining that those possible distant events pose an immediate threat. Our imaginations are so powerful that we can trick ourselves into “experiencing” all manner of possible (and impossible) events, and by doing so we can trigger the emotional cues that would usually prompt us to take action in the face of immediate dangers.

If you want to improve yourself, you first have to understand what makes your body and mind tick – your physical and mental operating system, so to speak. With that understanding in place, you can then take control of that system and make it work the way you want it to. The key term here is “system.” That’s singular, rather than the plural “systems.” Your body and mind are interrelated aspects of a single, overall whole, which is ultimately rooted in your biology. By intentionally manipulating that biology, you can bring your body and mind into better harmony with each other and your goals. Biohacking is the practice of doing just that. In these blinks, you’ll learn some of the main principles of biohacking, along with some of their most helpful applications. These aren’t pulled out of thin air. The principles are built on an understanding of human biology and psychology, while the applications are derived from interviews the author, Dave Asprey, conducted with 450 highly successful individuals. These individuals come from a wide range of fields, including business, sports, science and the arts. While benefiting from their collective wisdom, you’ll also learn some simple but powerful tricks that can help you overcome your fear; the real, hidden causes of your hunger; and the benefits of eating like your grandma. Before we dig into the practicalities of biohacking, let’s first answer a more preliminary question – why bother with biohacking in the first place? Well, the short answer is that your body and mind’s operating system is outdated. It was built around the needs of our prehistoric ancestors, who evolved in a world much more hostile than ours – a world in which mere survival was their paramount objective. To bring your operating system up-to-date with the modern world and make it more in sync with your less survival-oriented, more higher-order goals, you need to upgrade it. To do that, you first need to know what you’re updating. In a nutshell, your brain has certain default settings, and your instinct is to follow them. These settings take control of your nervous system to keep you focused on the three fundamental factors of a species’ survival. We can call them the three Fs – fear, food and, for the sake of politeness, let’s call it “fornication.” The three Fs constitute the most crucial aspects of biological survival. Want to avoid starving to death? Eat. Want to avoid going extinct? Reproduce. Want to avoid being killed by threats in your environment? Fight or flight – the two basic behavioral responses to fear. It might not seem obvious, but many of our everyday behaviors and desires revolve around the three Fs. We spend much of our time chasing after power, money and physical attractiveness. Why? Largely because they help us secure safety, food and sexual partners. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with any of these things in and of themselves. The problems come when these things control us, rather than the other way around. If left to their own devices, our automatic thoughts and behaviors can get us stuck in bad habits, discouraging creative thinking and innovative behaviors. Meanwhile, our powerful urges to seek out safety, food and sex can lead us by the nose, taking us away from our goals. The point isn’t to renounce food, sex or safety. It’s to take control of our automatic thoughts and behaviors around them, putting our more rational selves in the driver’s seat. And that’s where biohacking comes into the picture. But before we get into the nitty-gritty of it, let’s address two important foundations for this project – your goals and your priorities, which we’ll look at in the next two blinks. The idea behind biohacking is to optimize your ability to reach your goals – but that’s pretty pointless if you don’t know what your goals are in the first place! Here are some tips for clarifying them. First, identify your true passions in life. These are the things you love doing so much that you feel excited just thinking about them. Take billionaire Naveen Jain, for example. He’s founded seven internet and technology companies and is so passionate about science that he jumps out of bed every morning after only four hours of sleep, simply because he’s so eager to continue learning! To help yourself identify your passions, try this simple thought experiment. Imagine you’re a billionaire with a fantastic family and a happy home life. All of your basic needs and desires are taken care of. What do you do now? Whatever your answers are, those are your true passions – because you want to do them for their own sake, not as a means of making money or achieving some other goal. This brings us to the next tactic, which begins with distinguishing between your means goals and your end goals. Your means goals are the things you want to achieve in order to achieve something else. For example, someone might want to get married so he can feel intimately connected to another human being. Your end goals, in contrast, are things that you want to achieve for their own sake. These are the reasons you want to accomplish means goals in the first place, for example, the feeling of connection itself that motivates someone to get married. These end goals come in three basic flavors. The first is to have experiences, like waking up next to a loved one in bed every morning. The second is to achieve growth, for example by developing leadership skills. The third is to contribute to the world, such as building a unique company that has a positive impact on others. When you’re planning your day, it’s crucial to remember your end goals. That’s because we have an unfortunate tendency to become overly fixated on means goals, like making money. When that happens, we lose sight of our end goals and stop working toward them, devoting all of our time and energy toward the means goals and forgetting why we wanted them in the first place. Much like the money in your bank account, your time and energy are precious, finite resources, so you need to guard them and deploy them strategically. And one of the key ways to do that is to avoid one of the most common time and energy-depleting sinkholes: decision fatigue. This phenomenon is the results of a simple, unfortunate fact – making decisions is hard work. First, you’ve got to weigh your options, which takes brain power. Then you have to commit to a choice, which takes willpower. You can think of your willpower as a muscle. Every time you exert it, it gets a little more worn out. Now, by the end of each day, you’ve made dozens, if not hundreds, of decisions, ranging from small ones, like which socks to wear, to large ones, like how to break bad news to a friend or colleague. None of those decisions are necessarily overwhelming in and of themselves, but cumulatively they take a toll and leave you increasingly exhausted as the day progresses. That’s decision fatigue. The simplest way to avoid it is to minimize the number of decisions you have to make each day. And the easiest way to do that is to automate as many tasks as possible – especially those that aren’t directly relevant to your end goals. For example, you can automate your daily decisions about what outfit to wear by creating a capsule wardrobe, which consists of just three or four neutrally-colored items for each of the main categories of clothing: tops, bottoms, jackets and shoes. Now, you don’t need to waste mental energy figuring out which items match each other. You can just throw any of them together and head out the door. In creating your capsule wardrobe, you’ll be taking a cue from Steve Jobs, who took this logic one step further. By adopting his signature black turtleneck and New Balance sneakers, he dispensed with his clothing choices altogether! You can apply a similar approach to other everyday tasks as well. For instance, creating a capsule diet. This is a collection of five or six healthy meals that you cycle through. That way, you can avoid having to make all the decisions involved in planning meals. By automating your everyday tasks, you’ll have more time, energy and willpower to devote to your higher goals in life. You’ll thus be able to prioritize the latter – reserving your most precious internal resources for your most important work, rather than squandering them on trivialities like which shirt to wear in the morning! With your purposes and priorities in place, you’re now ready to pursue them by biohacking your mind and body. How do you edit your default settings, thereby taking charge of the unconscious urges that center around the three Fs we mentioned earlier? To answer this question, let’s start with the most ordinary of the three Fs: food. The biological importance of this will come as no surprise since food literally provides the energy your mind and body need to operate at all, let alone at their peak performance. What may surprise you is just how important food can be to success. Out of all of the high-performance individuals the author interviewed, more than 75 percent of them said their diet was the most crucial factor behind their performance levels. When approaching our diet, our focus shouldn’t be so much on what to eat, but rather how to eat. The key fact to understand here is that our modern approach to food is out of sync with our actual, biological needs. A big part of the problem is psychological. For a number of reasons, which we’ll look at more closely later, we experience lack in many areas of our lives – lack of energy, sleep, love, connection and security. Rather than addressing this lack directly, we try to fill it with food. “But wait a minute,” you might say. “I only eat when I’m hungry!” Well, sure – but here’s the thing: what you interpret as hunger is often just the sense of emptiness that comes from feeling this lack we mentioned earlier. So yes, you’re “hungry,” but often in a deeper, more psychological sense. People turn to food as a substitute for the things that would really nourish them and satiate their inner hunger, such as a loving relationship. This is part of a larger phenomenon called emotional eating. This is when we habitually seek out food when we’re feeling sad, stressed, angry, bored or even joyful. If you’ve ever dug into a carton of ice cream while feeling blue or treated yourself to a celebratory dessert after achieving something, then you’ve experienced emotional eating firsthand. We’ll look at why this is a problem and how to solve it in the next blink. The feeling of hunger is supposed to act like an internal barometer that tells your mind when your body needs food. Unfortunately, emotional eating makes the barometer go haywire, which results in overeating. That’s especially problematic in today’s world. We’re surrounded by all sorts of junk food and unhealthy attitudes toward food, such as large portion sizes and snacking throughout the day. To take control of your diet, you need to recalibrate your hunger barometer. The first step is to start identifying the false signals it’s sending you. When you find yourself feeling hungry, you can ask yourself a few questions. For example, am I actually hungry, or am I really just feeling bored, stressed, lonely or some other emotion I’m misinterpreting as hunger? Could it truly just be a coincidence that I happen to feel hungry right after someone has upset me? Correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, of course, but if there’s a consistent pattern of overlap between your hunger and certain emotional states, then there’s a reason to be suspicious of that hunger. You can also look for some telltale signs of emotional eating. These include sudden flares of hunger, cravings for specific foods or persistent feelings of hunger even after you’re done eating. But keep in mind that these signs can also be symptomatic of problems with your diet. What kind of problems? Well, our unhealthy modern diets provide a wide array of possible culprits, ranging from too much trans fat to too little protein. To recalibrate your diet alongside your hunger-barometer, you can follow this simple rule of thumb: eat like your grandma. Assuming she was alive before World War II, she probably ate a much healthier diet than you do now. That’s because she lived in the last chapter of human history that preceded the rise of the modern food industry. What did grandma eat? Lots of vegetables, plenty of protein-rich foods and a daily tablespoon of fish oil. That way, she got the polyphenol compounds her body’s cells needed to stay energized, the amino acids and proteins she needed for building muscles and the omega-3 fatty acids that provide the building blocks for the body’s anti-inflammatory hormones. And how did grandma eat? Moderately and infrequently. If you’re eating the right kinds of food, you should be able to eat a small meal and go five hours without getting hungry again. If you want to generate and conserve energy for your mind and body, there are other physical needs you need to attend to beyond eating. One of them is getting a good night’s sleep. This was the fifth most common performance-enhancing habit of the high achievers the author interviewed. The key to biohacking your sleep is to identify your natural sleep pattern and adjust your sleep schedule accordingly. This pattern is set by your body’s natural circadian rhythm, a cycle of biological processes that provide your body with an internal clock. These rhythms come in four types of patterns, which are called chronotypes. First, there are lions, who roar with energy before the sun has even risen and then peter out in the evening. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are wolves, who are naturally inclined to wake up later in the day and have two peaks of energy: one from noon to 2:00 PM, the other beginning after sunset. In between these two extremes are bears, who have a natural sleep pattern that follows the rise and fall of the sun. Finally, there are dolphins, who are prone to insomnia and tend to perform best from midmorning to early afternoon. Your chronotype is genetically determined, so there’s no point trying to resist it. The sooner you embrace it, the sooner you’ll improve your sleep. That, in turn, will boost your alertness, which will enhance your overall productivity and performance. That was certainly the author’s experience. He spent many years trying to be a lion when really he’s a wolf. He’d force himself to wake up every morning at 5:00 a.m., even though it didn’t come naturally to him. Why? Well, he was trying to conform to society’s conventional notions of success. “The early bird gets the worm,” as the old saying goes. But it doesn’t get the worm if it’s too tired to think straight! With a foggy mind, the author found himself less creative than he used to be. When he adjusted his sleep schedule to make it sync with his wolf-style circadian rhythm, he became happier and more productive. So, which chronotype are you? One way to find out is to use your next vacation week as an opportunity to conduct a little experiment. Simply let yourself go to bed and wake up when your body feels like it. The pattern you gravitate toward will most likely be your chronotype. Like the author, you can then adapt your sleep schedule to your chronotype. Besides eating and sleeping, there’s another thing your body needs to do to be energized – move. After all, that’s one of the main things it was designed to do. Unfortunately, today’s sedentary lifestyle means that most of us aren’t naturally moving our bodies as much as we should. Whether it’s in the office doing work or on the couch watching TV, we spend a lot of time being stationary. And all that sitting takes its toll on our bodies, leading to stiff muscles and back pain. So the obvious solution is exercise – right? Well, actually, that can be part of the problem, unless it’s approached in the right way. There are a few reasons for this. First, if you think that all you need to do is exercise a little each day, without making other lifestyle adjustments, you could end up being a mostly sedentary person who happens to do intense movements from time to time. In fact, a six-hour bout of sitting can negate the benefits of a one-hour workout. Second, high-risk sports can put our bodies at risk of injury, which defeats the whole purpose of exercise. Now, maybe you don’t play American football, so this doesn’t sound relevant to you, but one of the most popular forms of exercise is actually a high-risk sport – running. The problem isn’t running per se. Rather, it’s running the wrong way. Because of our sedentary lifestyles, most of us don’t have the motor control and range of movement that we need to have mastered to be able to run safely. Without such mastery, we push our bodies past their limits and move them in unnatural ways, which puts too much stress on them. That adds danger to any form of exercise, including yoga, Pilates and CrossFit. Third, aerobic exercise leads our bodies to produce the stress hormone cortisol. This, in turn, triggers the creation of oxidative substances that make us age faster and cause inflammation. Fortunately, there are some simple things you can do to mitigate these problems. For example, to avoid sitting too much, invest in a standing desk. To learn how to move your body properly, consider working with a functional movement coach. And, finally, to counteract the negative effects of aerobic exercise, add strength training to your workout routine. This will cause your body to produce anabolic hormones, which will combat oxidation. To further counteract the aging effects of oxidation, you can also supplement your aerobic exercise with antioxidants and probiotics. If you increase your energy through better sleep, diet and exercise, the last thing you’ll want to do is waste it. Unfortunately, there are many ways your energy can be hijacked. Chief among them is an activity that is practically an obsession for many people – sex. When we’re not doing it, we’re often thinking about it. And even when we don’t think we’re thinking about it, we’re frequently still thinking about it. For example, when we spend time trying to improve our physical appearance, it’s sexual attractiveness that’s often our underlying, albeit unconscious, motivation. From an evolutionary standpoint, it makes sense that we would put so much energy into sex. After all, without sex, the human species would have been nipped in the bud. From an individual standpoint, though, there are two problems with expending so much energy on sex. The first one follows from the simple fact that your energy is a finite resource. The more of it you allocate to sex, the less of it you’ll have to allocate to other aspects of your life. Conversely, if you can sublimate – that is, re-channel – your sex-bound energy into higher pursuits, like creative projects, you’ll have more energy to devote to them. That’s why boxers and even whole World Cup teams abstain from sex prior to competitions. Muhammad Ali is even said to have avoided having sex for six weeks prior to a boxing match! The second problem is specific to men and comes down to the biochemical effects sex has on the male body. After men ejaculate, their bodies produce the hormone prolactin, which makes them sleepy. It also counteracts another hormone, dopamine, which makes them feel good. That’s why they often feel tired and even depressed after sex. Women produce prolactin after having orgasms as well, but to a much lesser degree. For them, orgasms produce a number of positive biochemical effects instead. First, the body’s production of the stress- and inflammation-causing hormone cortisol is lowered. Second, orgasms increase the body’s production of the mood-boosting neurotransmitter serotonin, the emotion-mellowing hormone oxytocin and the oxytocin-enhancing hormone estrogen. To minimize the effects of orgasms on men and maximize their effects on women, the author recommends that men limit themselves to one orgasm per week and that women seek out more frequent orgasms – at least two per week. Some of the male listeners of the author’s podcast, Bulletproof Radio, followed this advice. They reported great success. One listener found the energy to launch a company he’d been dreaming of for years, and another listener, who was in his late 20s, landed a $60,000 raise 60 days after he started following the advice. Finally, we come to the third F – fear. Unfortunately, we need to start with some bad news. Thanks to evolution, your subconscious doesn’t want you to feel safe, generally speaking. That’s because when you feel safe, you let down your guard – and if you do that, you might get eaten by a saber-toothed tiger. Of course, that’s not going to happen. Saber-toothed tigers have long been extinct, and we live in a much safer world than our prehistoric ancestors did. But your subconscious doesn’t know that. It evolved to meet the demands of their world, not ours. Unlucky for us, that means we feel a lot more fear than is warranted by our present conditions. Fear is a useful emotion to feel when our lives are actually in danger – but there aren’t many situations in which that’s actually the case in modern times. Outside of those situations fear is not only useless, but extremely detrimental to our success and happiness. Why? Well, first of all, fear triggers stress, which in turn drains our energy and eventually leads us to feel burned out. Second, fear takes us out of the present moment. That’s because fear is usually about something negative that might happen in the future, such as an upcoming presentation that you fear will go poorly. By focusing on this hypothetical future, you lose sight of what you’re doing in the present moment. That’s especially problematic when you could be working on preventing what you fear from happening – by, for instance, preparing for that presentation! Third, fear discourages us from taking the risks that lead to success. After all, fear is basically an emotional signal that tells us to be cautious, and taking risks is the opposite of playing it safe. A risk is a gamble – and if it goes the wrong way, you’ll experience failure. In prehistoric times, failure could easily mean death. If you failed to find a source of food, you’d starve. If you failed at the social customs of your tribe, you might get banished. As a result, we’re hardwired to be strongly ill-disposed toward failure. Of course, you can overcome fear through courage – but being courageous takes a lot of energy, which takes us back to the first problem! Again, you only have so much energy, which means courage can only take you so far before it runs out. If you add up the three problems that come with fear, it leaves you with an exhausted, unfocused and risk-averse mind – hardly a recipe for success. We’ll look at how to overcome this in the next and final blink. Imagine you’re one of your prehistoric ancestors. You’re standing in a clearing surrounded by bushes. There’s no saber-toothed tiger in sight. So, you can kick back and relax, right? Well, no – after all, a pack of tigers might be lurking right behind the bushes. In order to let go of fear and feel safe, your subconscious doesn’t just want you to find an absence of threats. It wants you to find confirmation of safety. And to that end, it’s waiting for you to perceive a safety cue – something that tells you that the coast is clear and you can let down your guard. Here are three cues to try out. The first is to listen to a soothing voice – one that’s reminiscent of the gentle tone that parents use when trying to calm their children. Peaceful music can also do the trick. So can talking to yourself in a tender way. Better yet, fight your fear in two ways at once by doing a guided meditation. The calm voice of the instructor will send a signal to your subconscious that everything’s okay, while the meditation itself will bring your mind back into the present – away from worries of the future, where fears tend to lurk. Another cue to try is to visualize yourself in a happy place. This is a safe, peaceful setting in which you’re completely at ease. Imagine this in as much detail as possible, using all of your senses. The more palpable the imagined scene, the more persuasive it will be to your subconscious. Remember, you’re basically trying to trick your subconscious into thinking you’re actually in your happy place, so pull out all the stops when imagining it! The author reports that his “may or may not look like the Bat Cave.” Finally, try to feel gratitude for as many things, people and events in your life as possible – even your failures, which you can reinterpret as helpful learning experiences. By feeling gratitude, you’re basically telling your subconscious that things are going well. After all, you wouldn’t be feeling gratitude if a tiger were about to pounce on you! To cultivate this habit, keep a journal in which you write down three things for which you’re grateful every morning, every night or both. Doing this, you’ll be following the lead of the entrepreneur UJ Ramdas, who co-created the Five Minute Journal, a gratitude journal app. He claims that by keeping such a journal, you can improve your quality of sleep, your sense of closeness to friends and family and your desire to do kind deeds for others. Now, that sounds like something to be grateful for! The key message in these blinks: Our bodies and minds are held back by unhelpful patterns of thoughts and behaviors, which revolve around food, fear and sex. By understanding how our bodies and minds work, we can overcome these patterns and enhance our ability to generate, preserve and deploy our time and energy. With a clear conception of our goals and by carefully setting our priorities, we’ll be in an optimal position to succeed.  Actionable advice: Stop using the word “can’t.”  As you’ve learned in these blinks, your subconscious isn’t that bright – at least not in certain respects. One of those respects is understanding the context and the non-literal meaning of the language you use when speaking to yourself. If you say you can’t do something, your subconscious will interpret this quite literally and it will give up, since there’s no point trying to do something that you can’t do. But you probably don’t mean this literally. When you say you can’t do something, what you really mean is that you don’t have the resources, the skills, the confidence or some other prerequisite for doing it. And that condition can be overcome. For example, if it’s a skill or resource you lack, how can you develop or acquire it? In contrast, can’t is an impervious, conversation-closing condition. So, give your simple-minded subconscious a break by avoiding the word can’t. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Increased knowledge? For centuries, thinkers have grappled with this profound and difficult question. And many of the finest minds in human history, from Aristotle to Nietzsche, have tried and failed to understand what truly makes us happy. But we may be getting closer to an answer. In these blinks, based on the thinking of one of the leading minds in the field of happiness, you’ll learn about a truly scientific approach to well-being. By approaching the subject scientifically, psychologists have found multiple elements that, when combined, constitute human well-being. These blinks help explain what these elements are and how they can be used to help us all find happiness and peace of mind. They also explain where you can find the positivity in King Lear; why wealth is most definitely not the path to well-being; and why IQ tests don’t measure real achievement.  Prescription drugs are our society’s quick-fix solution for people struggling with mental health issues. But, in the long run, such short-term solutions often do more harm than good.  Countless studies have revealed that, in most cases, prescription drugs are only partially and temporarily effective. Drugs such as Prozac, Zoloft and Lexapro do have a significant impact on 65 percent of patients – but this number becomes less impressive when you consider that the placebo effect has the same impact on 55 percent of patients.  Six of these studies were compared by a group of esteemed psychologists and psychiatrists, and they found that, overall, drugs are effective in cases of severe depression, but fail to help those with moderate and mild cases. And yet, these patients are also in need of help. If drugs can’t provide them with the assistance they need, though, who or what can? The answer is positive psychology, an approach centered on improving well-being, happiness and enjoyment in life. Studies have shown positive psychology treatments to be surprisingly effective. Nearly all participants in a week-long series of positive psychology exercises – focused on gratitude and kindness to strangers – reported feeling far happier afterward. After a single week’s training, some patients even experienced positive results for up to six months.  Positive psychology isn’t just for combating mental health issues, either. Every individual, regardless of background or situation, can benefit from this approach. How? Find out more in the coming blinks!  Boosting your happiness and well-being sounds like a relatively clear goal. But try to define what happiness and well-being really are, and the picture becomes a little more complex.  Even philosophers struggled with the question of well-being and how to achieve it. While Aristotle argued that the central goal of human life was maximizing human happiness, Nietzsche believed that a hunger for power underlay all human pursuits, including that of happiness. Freud, on the other hand, was convinced that our desire for well-being was simply the result of our determination to avoid anxiety.  Though each of these theories have a rather specific conception of what well-being is, they still fail to capture the subtleties and nuances of this incredibly complex phenomenon. Well-being simply cannot be reduced to single variables. It’s neither the weather nor freedom that mainly influences our well-being. Rather, a whole range of different factors shape our happiness, often without our realizing it.  Positive psychologists must seek out measurable scientific elements in this rich tapestry of variables in order to understand well-being. This is by no means an easy task. Many approaches to measuring human happiness have severe shortcomings. Life satisfaction questionnaires, for instance, which are used to measure happiness, have been proven to only measure the mood of participants at the time of response, and fail to tap into their underlying levels of happiness.  Experiments, longitudinal studies, placebo-controlled studies and other reliable scientific methods are the positive psychologist’s tools for shedding light on the true nature of well-being. With empirical methods and innovative experimentation, positive psychology is firmly grounded in scientific thinking. That’s why it works.  Feeling curious about what variables of well-being have been identified? We’ll learn about these in the next blink.  How can we define well-being in a way that allows us to evaluate it objectively? Positive psychology has revealed five key elements that each play a crucial role in our happiness. The first three elements – positive emotion, engagement and meaning – have long been considered imperative.  Positive emotion refers to those great feelings we all love to experience: warmth, pleasure, comfort rapture, ecstasy and so on. Is your life full of these wonderful emotions? If so, you’re leading what’s called a pleasant life.  Engagement, on the other hand, has more to do with flow – the experience we have while completely absorbed in a task. When doing something we love, whether it’s playing video games, practicing an instrument or playing sports, flow makes us feel like time is flying by, and can even make us forget ourselves completely!  Meaning entails a sense of belonging and the will to serve a cause you believe in. From fighting for social justice or environmental sustainability, to giving your time and skills to a community that you relate to, meaning is what gives you a feeling of fulfillment and pride.  Alongside these three timeless elements, positive psychology has identified two other variables that shape our well-being today: accomplishment and positive relationships.  To put it simply, accomplishment is winning for winning’s sake. Feelings of success and achievement are deciding factors in our happiness these days. Accomplishments in our jobs, in our passions and in our communities are sure to give our well-being a boost.  Finally, positive relationships is about building a vibrant and varied social life filled with friends we love and trust. Great relationships are actually the best natural antidepressant, so it’s no surprise that those who benefit from strong friendships lead far happier lives.  Positive psychology aims to improve human well-being by ensuring that each of these five variables is at a high level. But how?  Having investigated the five key variables of well-being, let’s look at how positive psychology can be applied in schools to help children develop into happy, fulfilled adults.  Even the simplest positive psychology exercises can have a powerful impact on a child’s well-being. One of these is the What went well exercise. For one week, right before going to bed, students should take ten minutes to write down three things that went well that day.  After identifying these three things, students should answer the question, “Why did this happen?” Whether they focused harder or contributed to a class discussion, students will be able to recognize how their choices shaped their positive experiences. And this will help them repeat these positive choices in the future. Another basic positive psychology exercise is simply called the Kindness exercise. All kids need to do is think up a random kind act to do tomorrow, and then do it. After the kind act, be it surprising Grandma with a visit or giving a gift to a friend, children should observe the impact this has on their mood. This exercise sheds light on the power of little gestures to make not only others happy but also oneself.  Positive psychology can even be integrated into school studies. Sports, creative arts and academic subjects all provide ample opportunity for positive-thinking exercises. Literature courses at Geelong Grammar School, in Australia, for instance, promote well-being by teaching classic texts in light of the positive traits of every character – even of villains or tragic figures in plays like King Lear!  These strategies have also been subject to studies, with great results: High-school students that took part in a controlled positive psychology study were less depressed, had greater ambitions and fewer conduct problems than their peers. The author himself notes that the most positive feedback received in his long teaching career came from his students, who often described positive psychology exercises as genuinely life-changing.  We learned earlier that accomplishment is one of the essential pillars of well-being. So, what sort of metrics can help us evaluate accomplishment? Traditionally, intelligence was measured with IQ tests to predict chances of success. But this metric is far from sufficient.  For one thing, IQ tests simply cannot capture the character traits that are crucial to success. There are four qualities typically tied to high-achievers: speed of thinking, the ability to plan and revise existing work, fast learning rates and effort invested in tasks. IQ tests typically place a lot of emphasis on testing speed of thinking. Take the choice-reaction time exercise, for example. Subjects seated before a panel with a light and two buttons, one on the left and one on the right, are told to press the left button when the light is green and the right button when the light is red. They’re to do this as fast as possible. IQ results show a marked correlation with performance in this task.  Yet the remaining three traits of success are nowhere to be seen in typical IQ testing. New approaches to testing have had to be developed to consider other important qualities that help us achieve our goals.  Psychologist Angela Duckworth developed a composite measure with several tests for different characteristics: the Eysenck Junior Impulsiveness Scale, a 54-item yes/no questionnaire designed to measure impulsiveness; a self-control scale to be filled out by parents and teachers ranging from one for maximally self-controlled children to seven for maximally impulsive; and tests that investigate delay of gratification – a child’s willingness to give up a small satisfaction today for a greater one in the future. Students who scored higher on this new measure also exhibited higher grade point averages, better test scores and less absenteeism, making them more likely to achieve success after graduating.  Richer people have got to be happier, right? With excellent living standards and a network of friends just as accomplished and affluent as they are, why wouldn’t they be? Well, for lots of reasons.  If you consider the difference between GDP and levels of well-being, you’ll find a shocking discrepancy. Though GDP and life satisfaction generally share a positive relationship, a closer investigation reveals some strange anomalies. Latin countries achieve far better results in life satisfaction, despite lower GDPs. Post-communist countries with higher GDPs score below average on life satisfaction. And life satisfaction in the United States has not improved for 50 years, although the GDP has tripled in that time. Why is this? It becomes clearer when we see how GDP is calculated. The GDP is simply a measure of goods and services produced and consumed, regardless of whether these products decrease well-being. A spike in anti-depressant consumption implies more people being able to work, while a larger workforce and longer commutes to work lead to more travel expenses. Both raise the GDP, though they indicate a lower quality of life.  While wealth can provide us with material goods and pleasant customer-service experiences that make us feel good, it cannot offer us any of the remaining elements of well-being. Experiences of meaning, engagement and accomplishment in our lives do not arise out of wealth alone. Human relationships can even be negatively impacted by wealth, as we learn to rely on money more than we do on each other. So, don’t favor money over these other elements, figuring you’ll be able to buy them back later. That’s simply not how happiness works. The key message in this book: Prescription drugs, wealth and a high IQ aren’t the factors that make us happy, successful people. Positive emotion, engagement, accomplishment, meaning and social relationships are what really matter. By exploring positive psychology exercises in our lives and within schools, we can give ourselves the well-being we deserve.  Actionable advice: Give thanks! Simple exercises are all it takes to improve your well-being. The gratitude letter is one of these. Write a letter of gratitude to somebody who helped you without asking for anything in return. Take 300 words to express your appreciation in a concrete way, detailing how their help affected your life, and why you still reflect upon it today.

Breathless headlines boost the latest hype-driven trend as the royal road to health and happiness, before effortlessly moving onto the next gimmick. When it comes to nutrition, quick fixes tend to be short on staying power. The dietary advice outlined here, however, is different. It’s the result of over half a decade of in-depth research into the most up-to-date scientific data linking nutrition and cognitive health, and is focused squarely on the long-term. As these blinks will show you, eating the right foods in the correct quantities, won’t just make you happier and more balanced in the here and now – it’ll also fine-tune your brain cells in preparation for a long life of mental agility, free from chronic neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why you should be dressing your salads with plenty of olive oil; why cholesterol isn’t necessarily bad for you, but carbs and sugar definitely are; and how to implement a nutritional plan that’ll boost your cognitive health. Ever wondered how some 90-year-olds remain so whip-smart? Chances are it might have something to do with what they’ve been eating over the last half-century. There are plenty of myths out there about the way the brain works. One common misconception is that our brains stop developing once we hit 25. After that, it’s often claimed, it’s all downhill. But that’s just not true. In fact, our brains can continue improving throughout our lives. Scientists proved as much in the mid-1990s. Brains, they discovered, continue changing until death – something known in the field of neuroscience as neuroplasticity – and food plays an important part in keeping the brain healthy. Choosing the correct diet doesn’t just help prevent future illnesses like dementia, but it can also dramatically improve the function of the brain today. The author began to notice this after researching brain health and diet in an attempt to understand his mother’s early-onset Alzheimer’s. After adapting his own diet, he became more focused, energetic and balanced. That's because what we eat has a massive impact on overall brain health. A study conducted by the Food and Mood Center at Deakin University in 2017 found that severe depression can be treated by making dietary changes. When participants in the study cut sugar, fried food and processed meats from their diets, while eating more vegetables, olive oil, nuts, fish, whole grains, legumes and lean red meat, their depressive symptoms were radically reduced. Finnish neurobiologist Miia Kivipelto, an expert on the effects of diet and lifestyle on brain health, has further found that healthy eating can boost cognitive function more generally. Kivipelto’s study was based on 1,200 older adults deemed at risk of cognitive decline. Half the participants were enrolled in social support groups for loneliness, depression and stress, while simultaneously taking part in nutritional and exercise programs. The remaining participants received only social support. The results? The first group saw their cognitive function rise by an astonishing 25 percent, while their decision-making and interpersonal skills improved by 83 percent in comparison to the second group. So that’s the science behind healthy eating. Better dietary choices can make you smarter, happier and more productive. Say you’re making a salad dressing – what oil should you use? Is rapeseed or extra virgin olive oil a better choice? Let’s look at the different kinds of fats contained in oils, starting with polyunsaturated fats: these can nourish the brain, but only in specific circumstances. Omega-3 fats are a good example of healthy, polyunsaturated fats. They’re found in wild salmon, mackerel, sardines, eggs and grass-fed meats. They support the functioning of brain cells and boost memory, mood and executive function. A study at the Charité Hospital in Berlin showed just how effective these fats are. Adults who’d been given Omega-3 supplements for 26 weeks showed a 26 percent increase in executive functioning compared to the control group. But there’s a catch: while polyunsaturated fats found in fish and other products are great for your brain’s health, it’s a completely different story when it comes to refined, heated or processed oils like those used to fry food. These processes transform fats. Once they’ve been treated, they contain huge amounts of aldehydes – a byproduct of oxidized fats. That’s a problem. Aldehydes impair the functioning of the brain. Too much fried food causes a buildup of plaque in the brain – one of the key characteristics of Alzheimer’s. Brains affected by the disease display higher levels of aldehydes. Then there are monounsaturated fats: these nourish the brain and should be consumed in abundance. That’s because they protect neurons and boost neurotransmission. Extra virgin olive oil, avocados and macadamias are great sources of monounsaturated fats. The effectiveness of consuming large amounts of these fats was demonstrated in a study in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal in 2015. The paper looked at the “Mediterranean diet,” which is rich in monounsaturated foods. Participants consumed a liter of olive oil each week and found that their cognitive functions such as reasoning, attention and memory improved, while their risk of dementia declined after just six years. Finally, there are trans fats. These should be avoided as much as possible as they’re a serious hazard to your brain’s health. These are typically found in pre-packaged, processed foods like cookies, margarine and vegan cheese. They help extend foodstuffs’ shelf life and give them a delicious buttery texture. But however good they might taste, they’re a hazard. Trans fats stiffen neuronal membranes, making it more difficult for them to transmit information. High trans fat consumption has been linked to brain shrinkage and a higher risk of Alzheimer’s. One study carried out in 2015 even suggested that a person’s ability to remember words decreases by 0.76 words per gram of trans fats consumed! Sugar is a true master of disguise. Therefore, it’s essential to learn to spot it in all its various guises, but that’s easier said than done as sugar is routinely added to products in virtually every food group. This is especially true of refined sugar – the most concentrated source of carbohydrates. It’s often found hiding in everything from juices to crackers, condiments and soft drinks. Wheat, corn, rice, potatoes and sweet fruits are also packed with starches and sugars. Then there’s corn syrup, lactose and date sugar. Glucose is another type of sugar. It’s especially important to look out for this one because it compromises brain function. That’s because it sticks to, and eventually damages, the surface of proteins and cells necessary for the proper functioning of major organs and tissues, including your brain. This process is called glycation. Glycation triggers the formation of what’s known as AGE: Advanced glycation end-products. A brain with Alzheimer’s disease has AGE levels three-times higher than a healthy brain. Three separate studies published between 2011-14 showed that adults with higher AGE levels experienced steadily declining cognitive abilities, reduced neuroplasticity and problems with learning and memory. “All natural” fructose is another sugar that’s bad for your cognitive health. Marketed as a healthy alternative to other forms of sugar, fructose might not cause your blood pressure to spike, but there’s plenty of evidence that it can harm your brain. In fact, a recent study carried out on rats showed that fructose had a negative impact on their mental processing. Conducted at UCLA, the experiment involved feeding rats the equivalent amount of fructose found in a liter of soda. The rats showed signs of severe cognitive impairment – taking twice as long to navigate a maze as mice that had been fed water. Another study carried out in 2016 at the Mayo Clinic, a Minnesota-based nonprofit medical center, found that high fruit consumption was also associated with metabolic and cognitive impairments. That means your best bet is eating low-sugar fruits like coconuts, olives, avocados and cacao. Berries are another great option. Low in fructose, they’re packed with powerful antioxidants which have been shown to boost memory. There’s one simple and effective strategy that’s guaranteed to boost your cognitive health – cut down on grains and replace them with vegetables. Grains are loaded with carbohydrates which push your insulin levels through the roof, and that goes for regular bread, rice and crackers as well as whole-wheat alternatives. So what exactly is the problem with carbs? The pancreas releases insulin into your bloodstream when you eat carbohydrate-rich foods to convert sugar molecules into energy, but high carbohydrate intake over long periods of time can result in a resistance to insulin. That, in turn, sends a signal to your pancreas to release more and more insulin into your bloodstream to convert sugar into energy. And insulin resistance can lead to all sorts of brain health complications. One effect is a buildup of amyloid beta plaque – a sticky protein that’s a major symptom of Alzheimer’s. In fact, over 80 percent of Alzheimer’s sufferers are also insulin resistant. Even otherwise healthy people’s cognitive functions are severely impaired by high insulin levels. A study carried out by the Medical University of South Carolina found that the cognitive performance of non-diabetic subjects with high insulin levels declined steadily after six years. That means your brain will thank you if you cut out that daily bowl of pasta and embrace a low-carb diet. Take it from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging: The institute conducted a metabolic health program for people suffering from severe cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer’s. Alongside a range of measures addressing issues like exercise, sleep and nutritional deficiencies, the program also instructed participants to eat a “low grain” diet. After six months, cognitive testing showed that nine out of ten participants had much better memory and that their overall mental performance had increased! Eating healthily isn’t all about abstinence and cutting down on old favorites. On the contrary, feel free to help yourself to cholesterol-rich foods such as eggs, shrimp and other seafood. That’s because cholesterol – a fancy term for the fats in your cells and bloodstream – are essential to your brain’s health. In fact, a full 25 percent of your body’s total cholesterol is found in the brain. The brain needs all those fats to help create an insulating sheet known as myelin, which protects your neurons and helps keep your brain plastic and your nerve impulses firing away. A Framingham Heart Study carried out in 2005 found that participants with high cholesterol levels performed better during cognitive tests used to analyze concentration, verbal skills and abstract reasoning. That’s one of the reasons cholesterol-lowering medications have such severe cognitive side effects, including symptoms that can sometimes resemble those of dementia. As a recent Credit Suisse report concluded, the real cause of bodily disease isn’t eating too much cholesterol. Cholesterol-rich foods like eggs are actually incredibly nutritious. They’re a great source of choline – a compound which nourishes cell membranes, and acetylcholine – a neurotransmitter that supports learning and memory. The problems start when the so called low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which transport cholesterol through the bloodstream, become damaged by high-sugar foods, alcohol, refined carbs, chronic stress and fiber deficiency. That, in turn, makes it harder for the liver to process them, leaving them to circulate in your bloodstream until they eventually attach themselves to an artery wall. When that happens, immune cells rush to the scene to help out by creating multiple foam cells, which begin forming a layer of plaque ­– the real culprit behind high cholesterol-induced cardiovascular disease. So it’s not cholesterol itself that’s the problem, but sugar and carbohydrates. Steer clear of them and you’ll be in much better shape. Nutrient-rich cholesterol isn’t the only way to give your brain a boost, and it’s a good idea to get to know other sources of food for thought. Ketones are an especially efficient form of fuel for your brain. The best way to get them? Feasting and fasting. Let’s start with the latter. During lean times, your body breaks down body fat and releases it into your bloodstream. From there it’s carried to your liver, where it’s converted into a fuel called ketone bodies, or simply ketones. Unlike glucose, ketones are a clean fuel. That’s because the conversion process requires fewer metabolic steps and thus produces fewer harmful byproducts. And that’s good news for the brain. A study published in 2016 in the scientific journal Cell Biology even found that ketones help produce a “growth” hormone called BDNF that supports learning, brain plasticity and mood balance. Intermittent fasting is one way to go about producing plenty of ketones. That’s because it limits the supply of glucose and carbs your body usually relies on as its source of energy. Restricting your food intake or eating a diet low on refined carbs forces your body to look for alternate fuels, such as fat reserves. Once it starts burning through those it begins manufacturing ketones. A great place to start is by allocating 16 hours a day to fasting and limiting the window of time in which you can eat to eight hours. Doing that every day reduces your insulin levels and tells your body to start tapping your body fat. The benefits of this approach were demonstrated by a study conducted at Louisiana State University. Overweight participants were instructed to stop eating after two in the afternoon. That helped their bodies switch from burning carbs to burning fat and producing ketones. But reducing your intake of food isn’t the only way of creating more ketones. In fact, sometimes eating more of the right things can be just as effective! The key is to make sure you’re eating ketone-generating foods. That means foodstuffs rich in medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs. Coconut oil, palm oil and goat milk, for example, all contain fats that head straight to your liver to generate ketones. Supplementing your diet with MCT oils, while reducing your overall carb intake, should put you well on your way to a healthier metabolism. So why not sauté your vegetables in coconut oil next time you take an eight-hour break from fasting? There’s an old saying that “you are what you eat,” and that’s something of a motto for the microbiome in your gut. Let’s start with the latter: the gut begins in your mouth and ends… well, you can probably guess that part. The microbiome is made up of around thirty trillion single-celled bacterial organisms which live in the gut, whose job it is to extract energy and synthesize vitamins. To do that effectively your gut needs a balance of bacteria, and to give it that you need to eat plenty of prebiotic fiber. Prebiotic fiber is a special form of carbohydrate that helps nurture the growth and activity of gut bacteria. You’ll find it in avocados, sunchokes, leek, berries, coffee, unripe bananas, arugula and fennel. But wait, what does that have to do with your brain? The brain and the microbiome are closely connected. Prebiotic fibers are converted into short-chain fatty acids called butyrate, and these help the brain fight against aging and inflammation – meaning you’ll be more focused and have better memory. To see how much of a difference regular consumption of these fibers makes, consider a 2016 study published in the Journal of Gerontology. The paper’s authors spent a decade looking at a sample of 1,600 adults. Participants who ate a fiber-rich diet were a stunning 80 percent less likely to suffer hypertension, diabetes, dementia and depression than their counterparts who ate a fiber-poor diet.   There’s also the indirect relationship between your gut and your brain: the former controls your immune system, which directly affects the latter. The gut has the final say in telling your immune system what needs attacking. If it’s not in good health, it’ll start instructing the immune system to attack itself – something known as autoimmunity. And as a recent study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health points out, sufferers of autoimmune disorders are much more likely to develop dementia. Take people with celiac disease, a serious autoimmune disorder. When they eat gluten, their gut starts attacking the lining of the small intestine. Eventually, that undermines the strength of the lining to such an extent that bacteria begins entering the bloodstream. The effects of the consequent inflammation of the brain are dramatic and include lethargy, depression and anxiety. Neurotransmitters have a big name. But they have even bigger responsibilities. The most important transmitters go by the names acetylcholine, serotonin and norepinephrine. So what do these do? Let’s start with acetylcholine: it’s in charge of learning and memory. The best way to make sure you’re taking care of it properly is to cut out “anticholinergic” drugs and eat plenty of choline-rich foods. These drugs are usually prescribed for maladies such as motion sickness, allergies, depression, heartburn and insomnia. As a study by the University of Washington highlights, they’ve been linked to the development of dementia in chronic users. Choline is a dietary precursor to acetylcholine. You’ll find it in abundance in egg yolks, beef liver, shrimp, broccoli and scallops. Your next step should be to optimize your intake of serotonin – your brain’s mood neurotransmitter. Natural sources include vitamin D and omega-3s. That’s important because low serotonin levels have been linked to impaired learning and memory, poor impulse control and suboptimal long-term planning – all major traits of depression. Optimizing your serotonin intake can be as simple as making sure you’re getting enough sun exposure or taking daily vitamin supplements. Do that and you’ll be sure to see big improvements in your mood. Take it from the participants of a 2017 study at Deakin University Food and Mood Center: they found that their disposition improved greatly when they ate more eggs, olive oil, grass-fed beef and fish. Finally, there’s norepinephrine – the neurotransmitter that helps you maintain focus. It also has anti-inflammatory properties and protects the parts of the brain first compromised in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. Avoiding stressful stimuli can help boost norepinephrine. Anxiety triggers chronic norepinephrine release, damaging your cognitive health and making the transmitter much less effective the next time you need it. Exercise is equally important. A 2017 study published in PLOS ONE found that college-aged adults were much better at learning a new language when working out on a stationary bike than when sitting still! Let’s put everything you’ve learned in the previous blinks together to create an actionable plan you can start following today. The Genius Plan starts with a 14-day period in which you focus on eliminating brain-toxic foods like processed oils and grain products. Reducing your intake of these foodstuffs will reduce long-term brain inflammation. Brain inflammation can cause all sorts of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s, ALS and Parkinson’s, not to mention anxiety, depression, lethargy and reduced cognitive functioning. So what do you need to throw out? Firstly, get rid of refined and processed carbohydrates. Next on the list are wheat and gluten, concentrated and synthetic sweeteners, commercial cooking oils, juices and soft drinks. Now that you’ve eliminated or reduced your intake of these foods it’s time to talk about what you should be eating. The first two weeks of the Genius Plan are all about stocking up on brain nutritious foods. These include omega-3-rich oils and ketone generating fats, as well as grass-fed and free-range beef. Add plenty of raw nuts and seeds, vegetables, non-starchy root vegetables, low-sugar fruits, dark chocolate and fermented, organic soy to the mix. You don’t have to stop eating carbohydrates entirely, but you should aim to eat no more than between 20 and 40 grams a day. And when you do, go for fibrous vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli, as well as low-fructose fruits such as berries. By day 14, the author guarantees that you’ll feel sharper, have greater stamina, better digestion, deeper sleep and feel much happier. During the next stage of the plan, you’ll keep eating brain-nutritious foods while re-introducing specific carbohydrates. Keep your pantry stocked with lots of dark, leafy greens, carrots, avocados, coconut, eggs, mushrooms, flax and chia seeds. While you’re chowing down on those, increase your carb intake to between 50 and 70 grams a day. If you want to maintain your weight and aren’t doing more than a light daily workout, you can stay at this level. But if you’re doing more physical activity, focus on eating the right kind of carbs. That means ripe bananas, sweet potatoes and white and brown rice. Consuming these after high-intensity workout sessions will minimize fat storage and help your muscles to recover. So there you have it – an ultra-low-carb diet with an ultra-high return. An easy plan to follow if you want to keep your brain firing on all cylinders! The key message in these blinks: What you eat has a massive impact on your brain’s health. Choose the right diet now, and you can protect yourself against severe neurological diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s. But eating well doesn’t just secure your long-term health – it’ll also make you sharper, more balanced and happier today! Actionable advice: If you can’t resist the urge to eat something sweet, go for dark chocolate. Sugar impairs your cognitive functioning and the health of your brain. Unfortunately, it’s something we’re seemingly hardwired to crave. But there is an alternative – dark chocolate. More specifically, fairtrade, organic dark chocolate with a cocoa content of at least 70 percent. Not only is it delicious in its own right, but it’s something of a miracle product. It increases circulation to the brain, helps reverse cognitive aging and beats those sugar cravings! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s cleaning the house, getting that promotion at work or making a loved one feel special, many of us are guilty of lacking the commitment to achieve the things we want in life. And it's not just our big goals that we struggle to fulfill – sometimes just getting through our daily routine can feel like a struggle, with not enough time in the day for even basic tasks. Luckily, there’s a solution to this cycle of ambitious goal-setting, failure and self-loathing. Read these blinks to discover how you can start following through on your promises to yourself. From achieving your weight-loss goals to furthering your career, let’s go on a journey to discover how, with a little strategizing and a dash of focus and commitment, you can achieve your goals. A polite word of warning before you start, though: as you might have guessed from the title, these blinks contain obscenities. Read on to discover how to harness the power of negative thinking; why doing nothing can be the best strategy in a crisis; and what career-changing conversation you need to have with your boss. What’s standing in the way of you achieving your goals and being happy? When we’re challenged to get our proverbial shit together, our response is often “I just don’t know where to begin.” If this sounds familiar, then the first step toward getting your shit together is to consider exactly what your goals are, and when you plan to achieve them. It’s crucial to be realistic about what you hope to achieve, but many of us set the bar too high when it comes to our goals. This is problematic because we can’t become winners if we’re constantly holding ourselves to unrealistic standards. Our body goals are a perfect example. If you’re a normal person whose goal is to get in shape and lose some weight, it’s a tad unrealistic to strive to look like gorgeous fitness model Kate Upton. Most likely, you simply don’t have her body type. So setting a goal of looking like her would be akin to aiming for an unreachable finish line. How discouraging is that? So discouraging, in fact, that it might be enough to make you quit the gym altogether, sit on your couch and mainline cookies rather than working out. Therefore, get your shit together by ditching your unrealistic goals. Get on track by aiming for realistic progress that will make a difference to your actual life, like losing a few pounds of weight. In other words, don’t set goals based on other people’s measurements – measurements you’re unlikely to match. Another key step to getting your shit together is to establish a better relationship with time. If you feel as if you don’t have enough time to meet your goals, you probably have bad time-management skills. Combat this problem by gaining a better understanding of how you actually spend your time. You can do this by timing how long it takes you to fulfill routine tasks, such as having a shower or working out at the gym. Then, use this knowledge to create a realistic weekly schedule that contains all the things you want to do but never seem to have time for, such as learning a new skill. It really is that simple to start getting your shit together. A big part of getting your shit together is maintaining your valued relationships. To keep our social and family connections ticking over, we need to do things actively to maintain or improve them. One of the most central relationships in our lives is often the one we have with our romantic partner. But the best way to nurture this relationship isn't necessarily to be as accommodating as possible. Actually, a better way to improve or maintain a great relationship with your significant other is to get competitive with them. By getting competitive with your partner, we’re not talking about playing a doubles tennis match. Instead, being competitive in this context means competing to be the most loving and thoughtful person in the relationship. For instance, make it your goal to be the most helpful or the nicest one. Have a competition to see who gives the best present on Valentine’s Day or makes the nicest surprising romantic gesture. Injecting this loving rivalry into the mix is beneficial whether you’re in the initial throws of passion or have been together for decades already. Once you adopt this winning relationship mind-set, you’ll suddenly find that even the most mundane tasks become a labor of love for your partner. Even disposing of the garbage is now a way to score points in this competition, rather than a chore you find annoying. And if you want to win big at this loving competition, get organized. Set some time aside to make a list of all the things you could do for your partner that will bring you serious relationship points. These could be big things, such as romantic trips abroad, provided you have some significant cash at your disposal. But it’s important that your list also contains lots of small loving gestures that require much smaller expenditure too, such as keeping the freezer stocked with their favorite flavor of ice cream. In fact, small affectionate gestures expressed on a regular basis are much more effective than huge romantic gestures made only occasionally. Why? Because little, daily kindnesses give your partner the impression they’re always on your mind. Conversely, the annual romantic blow-out can sometimes leave your loved one thinking you’re just overcompensating for ignoring them all year! Getting your professional shit together means different things to different people. For the author, it meant taking the plunge, quitting her job as an editor and starting to work for herself as an author. For many of us, the equivalent might be gaining a promotion or a raise within our current position. But whatever career path you find yourself on, there are some universally applicable tips for getting your shit together. When it comes to the world of work, appearing confident – even if on the inside you’re anything but – is crucial if you’re going to win the trust and respect of others. To project more confidence in the workplace, start by taking a look at your colleagues. Who appears to have their shit together and how do they give off that impression? Your colleagues are probably doing remarkably simple things to signal that they’re capable, confident adults – things like having a cheerful and steady demeanor and managing to wear clean shirts without yesterday’s lunch stains. Ask yourself, would it be that difficult for you to emulate their confidence and togetherness? Probably not – you just need to keep a smile on your face and do your laundry! Another important way to get your professional shit together is to ask your boss the right questions. Namely, ask her what it is you need to do to reach your professional goals. For instance, if your dream is to become a director in your department, then explicitly ask your boss what you would need to do to be considered for such a position. Though this might seem like obvious advice, far too many of us keep quiet. Because we don’t ask the right questions, we end up guessing how to prove to our seniors that we’re ready for more responsibility. But what do you have to lose by asking directly? Even if your boss replies that there’s nothing you can do and there’s no way for you to progress in the organization, you’ve still learned something valuable. Specifically, you’ve learned there is no future for you in your current job, and you need to find a new one – one where you can progress. Millions of Americans are overweight and suffering from lifestyle-related illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. Given this, you might assume that this is a nation that cares little about its health and fitness. But you would be mistaken. In fact, when the author conducted a survey asking people where they felt they most needed help, respondents overwhelmingly talked about their physical health. So we really do care about our health, it’s just that we don’t know how to get our shit together. How can we change this? If you need some help when it comes to your physical fitness goals, then try changing how you think about them. Although everyone lauds the power of positive thinking to help you achieve your aims, the author believes that negativity can be just as powerful. For example, if you hate your body and your excess weight is getting you down, just weigh this negativity with how much you hate the idea of breaking a sweat in the gym. If your negative body image wins out, it’s time to hit the treadmill. After all, it’s better to face the short-term misery of lunges and squats than a lifetime of depression due to hatred of your appearance. Your physical health goals also don’t need to be radical for them to count toward getting your shit together. During her youth, the author forced herself to go on long weekend runs and watched countless exercise videos. She was convinced that she needed to be thin. But these days she couldn’t care less if she’s carrying a little extra weight, and has ditched the punishing exercise regimen. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have her fitness shit together in her late thirties. Nowadays she fits a little light stretching into her daily lifestyle. This fits in with her more mature priorities, which include being limber without slavishly devoting herself to exercise. If you aspire to have your shit truly together, you’ll need to deal with your emotional or mental health issues too. For many of us, that means learning how to cope with anxiety, a common mental health issue. Barring turning to a medical professional for help, there are two simple approaches that can help you deal with your anxiety. Sometimes the best strategy when dealing with anxiety-inducing situations is to face the situation head-on and rip off that anxiety Band-Aid. This strategy is helpful when dealing with situations from which it will be impossible to move on without being proactive. For instance, say you are desperate to move out of your current house-share and live on your own, but can’t face telling your housemate that you are moving out. The only way you can get on with your life is to take a deep breath and tell him or her. You can’t just disappear in the dead of the night without telling them, but neither can you secretly move out and pay rent on two apartments to avoid an awkward conversation. Your anxiety will only go away, and likely be replaced with relief, once you’ve had the conversation you’ve been dreading and moved out. The second strategy for coping with anxiety is precisely the opposite of the first. Instead of being proactive, consciously decide to do nothing. In this strategy, you ignore the situation and hope that any problems resolve themselves on their own. This may sound irresponsible, but it’s just sensible hesitation. For instance, if your boss sends you an ambiguous email that spikes your anxiety levels, it’s probably not a good idea to reply immediately or to go charging into their office to ask if you’re going to be fired. Instead, try sleeping on it. When you return to work after a good night’s sleep, there’s every chance that email will seem perfectly innocuous. And voilà – no panicky response was necessary after all. What would it take for you to be able to keep your home clean? Although this aspiration might sound straightforward enough, for many of us, it's only a matter of hours before the dishes start piling up in the kitchen sink, and dirty laundry litters the bedroom floor again. When it comes to being house proud, our best-laid plans quickly go awry. So how can you get your housekeeping shit together and remain in a perfect state of tidiness? The first step is to undertake a one-off decluttering session. Don’t overdo it during this initial tidy-up. You don’t need to engage in a life-transforming purge of everything you own. Instead, you should aim to get your home into enough order so that you wouldn’t be embarrassed if your neighbors showed up unexpectedly. Once you’re satisfied with your efforts, the next step is to make a plan for the long-term tidiness of your home. To do this, start by separating every cleaning chore you can think of into different categories. For instance, some of these categories could include putting your children’s toys away, folding and ironing laundry, taking the bins out, and vacuuming. Now that you have divided all your chores into categories, it’s time to commit to getting your shit together by making a pledge to yourself. Namely, you should commit to undertaking one to two of these categories every other day. By breaking your housework up into bite-size chunks, it will be more manageable, and you won’t feel overwhelmed. Schedule a small amount of time in your busy day to complete a category – when you think about it, you probably don’t need more than 20 or so minutes to get each one done. Once you’ve integrated this cleaning time into your schedule, you have no excuse not to stick to it. Some tasks, such as vacuuming, may require a little more of your time. But remember that vacuuming every other week for one hour is still going to be easier than adding that hour to another nine hours of other chores you have to do one day, all because you didn’t divide them into daily 20-minute chunks. So when it comes to getting your cleaning shit together, keep in mind that a little can go a long way. The key message in these blinks: So many of us set unrealistic goals for ourselves – goals we have no hope of ever achieving. Instead, take a look at what realistic changes would make a difference in your life. Once you have a realistic goal, break it into manageable tasks and make a small amount of progress every day toward making it happen. Getting your shit together doesn’t need to be difficult, you just need to be consistent.  Actionable advice: Use your common sense to lose weight. Losing weight isn’t rocket science. You shouldn’t continue eating whatever, and however much, you like, but neither do you need to eat just lettuce three times a day. To lose weight the sensible way, work out how many fewer calories you need to consume on a daily basis. Science tells us that 3,500 calories are needed to maintain around one pound of weight. Therefore, aim to lose one pound a week by cutting back your food intake by 500 calories a day. Simple – and no rabbit food required. Got feedback?

Shoot, even Ghandi had to talk his way out of stand-offs on a regular basis! These blinks apply some of the incredibly popular and successful tips from the negotiating handbook Getting to Yes to situations we all face on a regular basis. That means dealing with difficult relationships both at the office and at home, as well as finding solutions to the recurring problems we find ourselves trapped in throughout our lives. Nobody can avoid conflicts entirely, so these blinks are for everyone. In these blinks, you’ll find out how Tylenol dealt with their biggest PR disaster perfectly; why you have to give to receive; and why someone with no legs is as happy as a lottery winner. Think back to the last conflict you had with another person. Maybe it was a big fight or a simple disagreement. Can you remember what your first reaction was? Did you snap at the other person right away? Reactionary responses like this are very difficult to resist. They’re also highly detrimental and counterproductive. For example, imagine a mother who wants to have a close relationship with her four-year-old daughter. She loves her, but the little girl refuses to go to bed each night and it makes her mom extremely angry. If the mother gives in to her anger by yelling at her, the child will probably distance herself out of self-protection. Mom’ll end up undermining her goal of fostering a loving relationship with her daughter. When we judge others instead of seeking to understand them, we often forget about our real interests. Reacting out of anger or because your pride has been hurt will only make things worse. You can avoid this by focusing on self-understanding – observing yourself from a healthy mental and emotional perspective driven by empathy and self-control. Self-understanding allows us to identify our passing feelings and thoughts, then neutralize their effects. It helps us maintain a state of balance and calm. So even if the mother is frustrated, self-understanding could help her recognize her daughter’s patterns and choose not to react to them. A key part of self-understanding is self-observation, which means listening to your own thoughts with empathy and patience, just as you would with a loved one. This lays the foundation for self-mastery. In the mother’s case, self-observation would help her acknowledge her anger, remain calm and stay committed to her real goal of building a positive relationship with her little girl. It’s tempting to blame others when we get upset. Just like reacting angrily, however, this is counterproductive. Blaming other people is easy because it makes us feel innocent, righteous and superior while deflecting any guilt or responsibility – but it ultimately undermines our power. The author's friend Sam is a good example of this. He got into car accidents with the family van, then the family jeep, then finally his own car. Each time he blamed the accident on circumstances outside his control – the other driver, road conditions or unclear signs. He was never responsible. This kind of blame game comes at a cost: it makes us dwell on our victimhood instead of harnessing the power to change things. Sam’s accidents and his lack of responsibility led to a lot of conflict in his family. Owning up to your faults instead of denying them can actually be empowering. Embrace your negative qualities along with your positive ones – you’ll become more centered when you do. Fortunately, Sam managed to listen to his underlying feelings. He realized his accidents were really caused by his aggressive driving, which arose from feelings of insecurity and anger. When he accepted those feelings, he recognized that he was responsible for his own life. Once he got to yes with himself, he could also do it with his parents. He also stopped getting into car accidents! Taking responsibility isn’t just important on a personal level – it matters in business, too, as we can see from a tragedy that occurred in 1982, when six people died after ingesting Tylenol painkillers laced with cyanide. Instead of trying to avoid blame, Tylenol’s CEO took full responsibility, withdrew the product and didn’t try to stop the company from losing millions of dollars. Just months later, Tylenol successfully launched a new, tamper-proof bottle. Because the company took responsibility, people began to trust it again. There are a number of counterintuitive tricks that can help us in conflicts. One powerful trick is to maintain respect for your opponent – it’ll make them respect you in turn. Conflicts arise because we fundamentally see the world as a hostile place with scarce resources. When we view others as competitors for those resources we naturally develop adversarial attitudes toward them – we feel distrustful or afraid. This leads to social conflicts. You can change that attitude by restructuring your internal view of the world so that it’s more optimistic and cooperative. This will allow you to gain control of your own happiness. When you view the world as a fundamentally friendly place, you’ll start to see others as potential friends and partners rather than adversaries. Who do you think would be happier: someone who won the lottery or someone who lost both their legs? This is the question Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert asked. You might think the answer is obvious, but research actually shows that after a year, both people will be as happy as they were before the event. This suggests that major events or traumas have little to no effect on our present happiness. Happiness is something we determine ourselves – it’s a state of being. We assume that happiness is determined by outside influences, but it’s actually something we make internally. This is why changing your attitude about the world is so powerful. When you’ve adjusted your attitude, you can start viewing your environment in a healthier way. You’ll naturally want to connect with others in more positive ways. This is why modern police forces don’t respond to hostage situations with guns and tear gas. Instead, they strive to negotiate politely with patience and persistence. Respectful negotiation is much more likely to save the hostages – it’s the kind of negotiation even criminals really respond to. Many people struggle to really live in the moment. Why is this such a challenge for us? Our fears and anxieties are usually much greater than the actual problems we think are causing them. For example, Ury knew a woman named Judith who had a strained relationship with her teenage son. He was in his rebellious phase and harshly rejected her any time she tried to connect with him. No matter how hard she tried, he wouldn’t accept her. Judith became so anxious that her conflict with her son started to affect her husband, who had to mediate between them. The real problem was just her son’s rebelliousness, but it snowballed into a huge family fight. The present is the only time when we have the power to improve things and experience true satisfaction. Fortunately, Judith was able to ask herself, “What’s the worst that could happen?” and she realized the situation wasn’t as dire as she thought. She recognized her son was just going through his teenage years and let go of her need to win him over. Once Judith managed to stop clinging to her goal of having the perfect mother–son relationship, she freed herself from the shame and guilt of coming up short. Her son then realized she accepted him and he found it easier to approach her and enjoy spending time with her. Judith managed to get to yes with herself by embracing the present for what it was, rather than what she wished it was. She made peace with herself, and more importantly, she fixed the strained situation with her son. We’ve seen some ways we can look inward to solve outer problems. But it’s also important to look inward and reward yourself and others. When you discover the inherent joy of giving, you’ll shift your focus away from taking and set the stage for inner satisfaction, success and general win–win situations. Li Ka-Shing, a Chinese billionaire, was able to find inner peace and happiness this way. He was once asked in an interview about his business secrets for success. He said that one key was to always give his partners more than he took for himself. This made everyone want to be his partner, which helped him become so successful. In short, he gave instead of taking. He made deals that other people benefited from, instead of aggressively trying to make gains for himself at their expense. This didn’t just improve his business – it also made him feel better about himself. He managed to become successful and bring joy to others at the same time. Giving absolutely doesn’t mean losing. Giving can be about mutual gain: helping others while you help yourself. That’s how you start the beautiful and unending cycle of giving and receiving. Research backs up this approach. Carsten De Dreu, a Dutch psychologist, led a comprehensive analysis of 28 different negotiation simulations. He found that the most successful negotiators where those who used a cooperative approach that focused on meeting the needs of both parties. The people who tried to get the upper hand over each other were much less successful. When you get to yes with yourself and others, everyone can win big! The key message in this book: If you want to have positive relationships with other people, you first need to have a positive relationship with yourself. So listen to your thoughts, don’t judge yourself and accept your faults along with your positive traits. When you get to yes with yourself, you’ll lay the groundwork for getting to yes with others. You’ll bring more joy to the people in your life and feel happier. Actionable advice: Change the way you view the world. Your thoughts become your reality. When you start viewing the world as a friendly and loving place, you’ll feel more satisfied and find it easier to build and maintain meaningful relationships. Happiness is a state of mind – make sure your mind is in the right place!

And because most women feel a distinct need to fit in and have similar values to their peers, they feel unsure about stepping out of line and doing things differently. For many women, this upbringing and peer pressure results in the need to apologize or ask for approval if they have desires that don’t align with the traditional female roles of wife and mom. For many, being a good mom means that you have to devote yourself fully to your kids and give up ideas of a full-time career. But as author Rachel Hollis succinctly puts it, it’s time for women to stop apologizing and start embracing their unique desires in life. Whether your dream is to start your own business, create an app, run a marathon or write a book, these blinks provide some empowering advice on how to break free from concerns about what others are thinking, and focus your attention on the goals that really matter. In these blinks you’ll find how five hours a week can put you on the right path; how the 10-10-1 exercise can keep you focused and motivated; and why you should always be specific regarding your goals. Imagine what the world would be like if every woman pursued what she really wanted without worrying about getting judged or being plagued by self-doubts. Chances are, if just 5 percent of the women in the world were to fearlessly follow their desires, it would be an entirely different and altogether better world. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is, far too many women are neglecting what they want – and there’s a number of reasons why. For starters, it’s human nature to crave attention and care about what other people think. If you’ve spent any time with children, you know that, as toddlers, they all begin to realize that certain behaviors result in adults paying attention to them. These attention-grabbing behaviors become habitual, and we carry them into adulthood in different ways. Some children will realize that if they behave as though they’re feeling sick, adults will be kind and take care of them. This can easily turn into hypochondriacal behavior later in life. Likewise, many children realize that if they achieve certain things, they’ll get showered with praise. This can turn into an adult becoming a workaholic overachiever. So, whether we’re conscious of it or not, our actions are often predicated on how others will respond. Compounding our already troublesome desire for attention and concern over what other people think is the fact that young girls are often raised to believe that their value is solely based on whether they’ll make a good wife or mom. As a result, women are developing behaviors that aren’t based on achieving personal goals, but on pleasing other people. To put it another way: boys are being raised to pursue their dreams, while girls are raised to pursue what they believe is expected of them. So, to break free of these deeply-rooted barriers that stop you from being true to yourself, you need to stop focusing on meeting someone else’s expectations. Recognize that it’s okay if one woman’s dream looks completely different than someone else’s, and stop making excuses for why you’re not going after what you really want in life. As the author sees it, there are quite a few common excuses for why women are afraid to follow their heart’s desires. In the blinks ahead, we’ll tear down these excuses and replace them with empowering behaviors and skills that will get you on track to setting goals and fearlessly pursuing them. For years, the author led a double life as a devoted wife and mom, who just happened to have a popular lifestyle blog. The other half of her life was the reality behind that blog, which involved working 60-hour weeks overseeing a small staff and running her own business, of which the blog was only one part of. This double life was due to the fact that, like many other working women, the author was keenly aware that after she had her first child, a lot of people were expecting her to reduce her work hours. After all, popular opinion states that someone working as much as she was could never devote the appropriate amount of time needed to be a good mom. This is why one of the biggest excuses for not following your dream is telling yourself, well, that’s not what other women do. One of the problems is that, during adolescence, the last thing most people want is to stand out. Of course, there are those teenage rebels who try to stand out by dying their hair and wearing flashy outfits, but many more care too much about what others think; they find comfort in being exactly like every other girl. As a result, years of fitting in can go by before you ever ask yourself: Does being like every other woman really make me happy and fulfilled? Then, when you actually consider pursuing the goals that would bring you happiness and fulfillment, you may feel ashamed for wanting something that other women seemingly do not. But the truth is, you shouldn’t let other people determine your self-worth or make you feel guilty or ashamed of pursuing what you want out of life. Some women are happiest when they’re looking after their home and kids, but there’s no reason to apologize if that’s not your thing. Another common excuse for giving up on your dreams before you even start is to say, well, I’m not a goal-oriented person. Indeed, it takes more than just crossing your fingers and hoping for the best to achieve your goals. But here’s the good news: planning is a skill just like any other, and it’s never too late to learn a new skill and become more organized and productive. In the blinks ahead, we’ll look at some ways to get you started. We’ve all at some point dismissed an exciting new idea with the response, “That sounds great, but I don’t have time.” Well, brace yourself for some tough love, because this is another excuse that needs to be banished from your mind. If you’re to have any hope of reaching your goals, you need to stop looking for free time and start making time. This may require some difficult decisions and sacrifices, but it won’t be long before you’re making progress and reaping the rewards. The first requirement for making time is to accept ownership of your life. Whether you’re a CEO or a stay-at-home mom, you need to accept responsibility and take control over your time and schedule. This includes spare-time activities like watching TV. After all, if there are busy moms and executives who are currently making time to train for marathons, you can surely find the time for your goals as well. It may require unpleasant changes like giving up TV during the workweek or taking on a miserable unpaid internship for a few months, but these changes will eventually pay off and bring you a step closer to fulfillment. If you’re finding it difficult to make time, try creating a schedule that lists every hour of how you currently spend a full week. Now, find a minimum of five hours anywhere in the week during which you’ll commit to actively pursuing your goal. The hours don’t have to be consecutive but should be during times when you’re at your best – if you’re a morning person or a night owl, choose hours during those times. Now, try out this new plan for the week ahead and, over the course of that week, think about any changes you could implement to make the following week’s plan even better. Another all too common excuse is to feel like you just don’t have what it takes to succeed. In other words, you feel insecure. For many of us, this feeling may stem from past events. Perhaps the various bullies you’ve encountered over the years who made fun of you, or perhaps a teacher who always told you you’d never succeed. But past negative experiences don’t have to quash your future successes. When it comes to personal growth, everyone experiences it in different ways – some excel in classrooms, while others do better with online tutorials. The point is, if you’re eager and willing, then it’s just a matter of figuring out what works for you. Hopefully, you’ve never had to feel selfish doing something for the purposes of self-improvement. But unfortunately, “mommy guilt” is a real thing, and it’s resulted in plenty of women feeling compelled to give up on higher education or career plans. Mommy guilt is just another name for the expectation women feel to put aside their own passions and priorities for the sake of raising a family or caring for others. This leads us to the next excuse: What will they think? Simply put, we sometimes need to be selfish in order to accomplish our goals. The author’s father recalled something his professor said when he started his PhD studies: The professor told the class that they had to be selfish in order to make time for the grueling coursework and thesis writing ahead. If they weren’t selfish, family and friends sidelined during this time would surely be able to talk them out of it. The next time you’re considering doing something different because of what someone else might think, remember that there are two types of people in the world: stupid, judgmental jerks and nice, non-judgmental people. Now, judgmental jerks are going to find something to be judgmental about no matter what you do! So you might as well follow your heart and not waste time worrying about what they think. In a way, fear of what others think is closely tied to another excuse not to pursue your personal goals, which is the fear of failure. More often than not, it’s not messing up that’s scary, it’s what other people will think of you for not having succeeded. The author has had her fair share of public failures. In one incident, she tried to orchestrate a big push to get one of her previous books to debut on the New York Times bestseller list. Yet despite her 850,000 social media fans hashtagging like crazy, it didn’t happen. Yes, sometimes your best efforts may result in tears and embarrassment, but each misstep brings valuable lessons and only serves to strengthen your ability to carry on. In fact, life’s successes are made all the more beautiful by the failures that come before. Ultimately, when you let your worries about other people’s opinions get in your way, you’re giving up your power and letting others dictate your life. Remember, only you know what’s best for you. And besides, more often than not, people spend far less time thinking about you than you suspect. For centuries, traditional – and outdated – rules of etiquette say that “good girls” shouldn’t talk about money or wealth. Instead, they should be demure and make the most of whatever life provides. But as historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich wrote, “Well-behaved women seldom make history.” So, instead of telling yourself “good girls don’t hustle,” embrace your ambition and look at some good behaviors you can adopt to increase the chances of successfully reaching your goals. First off, it’s time to stop asking for permission. You may have been raised to recognize the voice of authority as being distinctly male, and therefore feel the need to seek permission. But the truth is, as a woman, you have all the authority you need to follow your own goals in life. The second good behavior to adopt is to focus on one dream at a time. It can be tempting to spread your interests across multiple goals or projects as doing so reduces the stakes. If a project doesn’t work out, it’s no big loss since you’ve got other irons in the fire. But this also means that there’s less chance of anything significant happening. As the author puts it, “When everything is important, nothing is important.” To help you focus on one thing, embrace the 10-10-1 plan. Think ahead to ten years from now, and how you’d like your life to look. Get as specific and detailed as you can by visualizing and writing down everything about this future life – from where you’ll be living and what your day is like to the kind of clothes you’re wearing. Now, think of ten dreams that would help to make this imagined future a reality. Then, from those ten dreams, pick the one goal that you believe to be the most important. So, ten years, ten dreams, one goal: 10-10-1. To make this exercise as effective as possible, you should find a way of making your one big goal specific and measurable. Something like “I want to be better at managing my money” isn’t very clear at all, whereas “I have $10,000 in my savings account” certainly is. The final piece of advice on this exercise is to write down your ten dreams every single day. And not as “I wish” or “I want” statements, but as though they have already come true. Ten statements like “I am an exceptional mom” and “I have $10,000 in my savings account” will be powerful daily motivators to keep you on track. We like to think that our role models do everything themselves, but this is rarely the case. Every successful person is likely to have a team of loyal people in her corner, who make it possible for her to focus on the important things instead of getting bogged down by mundane details. Therefore, one of the best new behaviors you can adopt is to ask for help. Don’t think that you have to do it all yourself. Assistants, teachers, housekeepers and nannies can all be invaluable resources in providing you with the support needed to reach your goals. However, all the help in the world may not matter if you don’t have a solid foundation for success in your life. In order to effectively pursue your dreams, you need to have some foundational practices and empowering behaviors in place, the first of which is a healthy lifestyle. For the author, this means staying hydrated, getting up early and making sure you spend a part of each and every day on the move. Remember, your body was made to move, not to sit around! An empowering community is also a part of a strong foundation. If you feel like you’re the smartest person in your circle of friends and colleagues, you need to expand your circle. Don’t be pulled down by the people you spend time with. Instead, surround yourself with people who enlighten, educate and make you better. A good morning routine can be the cornerstone of your solid foundation. If you wake up to a chaotic, unorganized morning, that chaos is likely to linger throughout the rest of your day. So, why not plan a perfect morning for yourself every day? For the author, a perfect morning looks like this. First, she wakes up at 5:00 a.m. and utilizes this as quality time before the kids get up. During this time she meditates and does some journal writing, as well as writing down her 10-10-1 dreams. Then, she feeds the kids and gets them off to school, after which she’ll put on some music, have her morning smoothie and plan the day ahead. Finally, the last empowering behavior the author recommends is to learn how to say no. Generally, if you have a decision to make and the answer isn’t an obvious “Hell yes!” then it should probably be an honest and polite “No.” Stay away from maybes, and always strive to respond truthfully. Along with your foundation of empowering behaviors, there are also certain skills that can help anyone reach their goals. Now, as with any skill, these are all things that you can get better at with some intentional practice. First is planning. If you feel like you’re terrible at planning, try this road map exercise: set your goal at the finish line, and then work backward. Think to yourself about what needs to happen for you to get from where you are to that finish line. Brainstorm as many useful ideas as you can think of, and then narrow it down to three of the most important mile markers, that is, smaller goals to get you to your main goal. You might, for example, want to publish your own book. Even though you may have all sorts of research and networking ideas, three good mile markers would be to write a book proposal, hire a literary agent and submit your proposal to publishers. The second skill is confidence. To illustrate the gender disparity when it comes to confidence, one recent study showed that men will often apply for a job if they feel they meet 60 percent of the role’s criteria, whereas women tend to only apply if they’re 100 percent qualified. Don’t forget that you can grow on the job, even if it’s a challenging one. The author turned a corner in her earlier career as an event planner when she took on a catering gig during the Sundance film festival. She didn’t have any first-hand catering experience, but she had confidence that her experience in planning events involving catering would pay off – and it did. Along with confidence, there are the skills of persistence and effectiveness. Remember that your education and training is never finished – there are always more ways to learn and improve. It also helps to always be specific with your goals. Instead of putting “work on your book” on your to-do list, tell yourself to “write 2,000 words.” You’ll find this to be a much more effective approach. Finally, there are the skills of positivity and leadership. If things get messy, that’s when you have to choose gratitude and positivity. This may not be the easy thing to do, but it will keep you in control. Finally, leadership may not come naturally. You may imagine “leaders” as sitting in big offices wearing power suits. But erase that thought and understand that you are also a leader. You can change the world and make it brighter by letting the fire inside you glow for all to see. The key message in these blinks: Many women feel the need to apologize for their ambitions in life when they don’t fit into the traditional roles women are supposed to be happy settling for. But grown women should never apologize for having their own dreams and goals in life, and they should never ask for permission before going after those dreams. There are behaviors that can help women achieve their goals, such as being more focused, building a solid foundation for success and knowing when to say no. Acquiring skills like planning, persistence and positivity will also help. Actionable advice: Don’t let “it’s already been done” get in the way of your goal. Another way of talking yourself out of doing something is to think, “Why should I bother if someone else is already doing something similar?” If you’re good at knitting adorable, custom-made pot holders, you might see someone else selling potholders on Etsy and give up your potentially lucrative business before giving it a chance. What often happens in these situations is that you’re comparing your beginning against someone else’s career in progress, which isn’t really helpful. Many of today’s success stories began with failed first attempts or otherwise less-than-stellar beginnings. So, if your goal is to become a novelist, just concentrate on writing, and don’t worry about your book being compared to anyone else’s. Most first efforts are just a necessary stepping stone to bigger and better things. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

We’re better fed, better paid, and, courtesy of the internet, better informed than any previous generation. Despite this wealth and comfort, we lack something very important: happiness. Across the Western world, scores of people are unhappy with their lives. Many search long and hard for a solution to this lack of fulfillment – and many never find it. This is where these blinks come in. They explain what exactly happiness is and how we can all go about finding it. If you are unhappy with your situation, read on to discover how you can shift your thinking and find an answer to your problems. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you should study like you make love; why an emotionless life would be pretty dull; and why “meaning” is essential for a happy life. Most people have heard the classic mantra coined by the reggae sensation Bobby McFerrin: “Don’t worry, be happy.” But have you ever considered why people hold happiness in such high esteem? For starters, most people consider happiness a valid life goal. If someone asks you why you’re doing something, and you answer that it makes you happy, your answer is valid in and of itself and can’t be challenged. All other responses, whether they’re related to fame, money, power, respect or any number of other things, are secondary to happiness, which is the ultimate goal. If you were to say that you were doing something for money, someone might ask, “Why do you need money?” In other words, regardless of whether people are working towards money or any other external goal, in the end, these aims are merely steps on the path to happiness. Just consider someone who wants money to afford more surfing vacations and a great underwater camera. For him, money is simply a tool to get the things that will make him happy. There’s nothing new about viewing happiness as the ultimate goal for humans. It has been the focus of philosophers throughout the centuries. David Hume, the eighteenth-century British philosopher, said that all human pursuits from the arts to science to law exist solely to enable people to achieve happiness. Not just that, but happiness and success are also deeply intertwined. Research on well-being conducted by psychologists Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ed Diener and Laura King has even found that happy people do better in different areas of life and work like relationships, health and finance. How come? It might be because people with a positive outlook see the world as an inherently positive place, which makes them open to good things happening. So, whether you see happiness as an end in itself or a step along the path to success, there’s no doubt that it’s worth pursuing. So, happiness is essential, but what exactly is it? It stems from two factors: letting in positive emotions and seeing life as purposeful. Or to put it differently, pleasure and meaning. Pleasure is the emotion that underlies motivation and therefore the pursuit of happiness. Without emotions, we would never have the drive to do much of anything at all. Simply put, emotions spur us on. That makes perfect sense since the word “emotion” is a combination of the prefix e-, meaning “away,” and the Latin movere, meaning “to move.” In this sense, emotions break us away from our standstills, moving us in new directions and prompting us to take action. Just consider jealousy, a powerful emotion that pushes people to do better than those around them. Or exhilaration, which makes us try things that provide a rush. And of all the human emotions, psychologist Nathaniel Branden singles out pleasure as the most necessary aspect of a satisfactory life. After all, people whose lives feature no pleasant moments don’t have the motivation they need to achieve happiness. But pleasure isn’t all that’s necessary. A fulfilling life depends on integrating pleasure with meaning to find true happiness. Taking ecstasy might be an extremely pleasurable experience, but it can’t produce happiness without meaning to make it fulfilling. So to be truly happy, we must pursue experiences that not only trigger pleasurable emotions but are also meaningful and personal. No matter how pure our goals, only when they meet these criteria will they actually produce happiness. Just consider a banker who feels fulfilled in her career and happy knowing why she was motivated to get into the field. She might have a more meaningful and spiritually fulfilling life than a priest who joined the church only because of parental pressure. By now you probably understand that you should be striving for happiness, but that’s easier said than done. To be truly happy, you’ll need to assess both your present life and what’s to come. Interestingly enough, people weigh the importance of the present and the future differently, and these variations break down into four types. The first group contains hedonistic people whose sole focus is on maximizing pleasure in the current moment without any regard for the future. Then there are people with no interest in life whatsoever – either now or in the future. These people are nihilists. The third group is composed of people who live for the future. They compete in the rat race of life, working hard and suffering in the hope of better days to come. And finally, there are people who enjoy the present, understanding that their current activity will also benefit them in the future. This last group of people is the happiest, but each person is actually a mix of all four. The goal is to endeavor to be more like the fourth type. This balance is crucial because those who work solely toward future happiness rarely find it. That being said, society tends to reward those who try to achieve happiness down the line by enduring suffering today. These people can be described as having a “no pain, no gain” philosophy. Just take school children. They’re encouraged to struggle and work hard, no matter how miserable it makes them because earning good grades will make them happier later in life. The problem is that this future happiness is perpetually postponed. When a student earns the high marks she needs to attend college, she’s told to work hard to earn a degree that will land her a great job. Then, once she gets hired, she’s told to climb the corporate ladder. As a result, she never gets to enjoy the fruits of her labor. So, instead of putting off happiness in the present to be happy in the future, set appropriate goals to make sure you can have both. Earlier you learned that having a purpose in life requires meaning. But fulfilling such a purpose can actually be quite a challenge. Say your purpose is to improve the world. Where do you begin? Well, to make sure that you’re advancing your purpose while making yourself happy, it’s important to set future goals that are in line with the principles of meaning and pleasure. Basically, this means having goals that bring you closer to your future dream while ensuring you a happy, pleasant life in the current moment. To find such a path it’s essential to focus on self-concordant goals. These are targets that you choose personally for yourself, not ones that are imposed by others. They should be a product of your will to express yourself and your true desires rather than a means of impressing other people. Such goals can only be found close to your heart, which is why it’s important to take a moment to reflect on the aspects of life that give you the most pleasure. Try to identify both long- and short-term goals that will guide you along your path. Say you’re set on helping animals. It’s a great calling and a long-term ambition. Once you’ve decided on this purpose, you can divide it into short-term, specific actions, like volunteering at the local animal shelter and participating in animal rights protests. Finally, to be sure that you’re moving forward, add deadlines to your short-term goals. It might help to divide them up into three months, one year and five years, giving yourself plenty of room to build toward your long-term goal. Now that you’ve got a sense of how to build happiness in your life at large, in the next blinks you’ll learn how to make yourself happier in your education, work and relationships. Did you take pleasure in all those caffeine-fueled cram sessions in college the night before big exams? Probably not, but it doesn’t have to be that way. When learning new things, finding pleasure and meaning is the best way to feel fulfilled. For students, that means first reflecting on how happy your chosen field makes you. Once you’ve done that, you can identify your true self-interests and pick subjects that really bring you joy. It won’t just make school more enjoyable; it will boost your motivation too. You’ll find that studying becomes more pleasant and you’ll see academic challenges as an important step on your journey. You can think about the stages of knowledge acquisition through the lens of lovemaking. You want the foreplay, like reading, researching and writing, to be pleasurable. And you know that it will all be in the service of a climax when you have mastered the deepest intricacies of your field. If you want to learn Japanese, find a teacher who employs creative methods. You’ll have a great time studying, and the climax will come when you’re completely fluent, communicating without any effort at all. Another tool to increase your overall learning success is striving for a state of flow. This concept was most famously employed by the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow occurs when you become so engrossed in something you love that you’re entirely immersed in the process. When you’re in a state of flow, you don’t feel the anxiety and stress that learning can trigger. Instead, you just act – almost without thinking. But to achieve such a state you need to avoid pushing yourself to too high a level before you’re ready. By remaining at a level you can enjoy, you can let flow happen naturally. Many people are so discontented with their jobs that you can hear them audibly moaning in the office. It makes you wonder, is it worth taking the time to identify what you actually want to do all day? Well, one thing is certain, if your work is in line with your calling, your life will be much happier. Just take the psychologist Amy Wrzesniewski, who discovered that people who view their jobs as their vocation see work as a reward in itself. These people care about money, but it’s not why they show up every morning. They do their jobs because they love them. It makes perfect sense that such people would be happier than those who work for external motivators like money, promotions and fame. But to find your calling, you’ll need to commit to the search. After all, education systems and professional placement tests often fail at this task by encouraging people to do what they’re good at, not what moves them. To overcome these societal pressures and identify your calling, try using the Meaning, Pleasure and Strength Test or MPS. Begin by writing three lists: First, answer the question, what do I find meaningful? You might answer: writing, music, working with kids, solving problems. Second: where do I find pleasure? It could be horseback riding, reading, music and time with children. And finally, ask yourself, where are my strengths? You might say empathy, problem solving and getting along with kids. The next step is to notice the overlaps. From the answers above it’s clear that working with kids would be both pleasurable and meaningful for you. Then consider other areas of your life. It might be that you’re highly organized, enjoy planning and love to travel. Having added this new information to the lists, you might decide to become a music teacher. While it may not be the most financially lucrative career choice, you can rest easy knowing it’s the choice that will make you the happiest. Imagine you get home from a long day at work. You’re absolutely exhausted, and your best friend invites you out for a night on the town. Despite being tired, you say yes, and by the end of the evening, you actually feel energized. It may seem contradictory to get an energy boost from such an outing, but dedicating time to deep social relationships will boost your long-term happiness. Just consider the positive psychologists, Ed Diener and Martin Seligman, who looked at the differences between “very happy people” and those who were less satisfied. The only significant difference between the groups was that those who saw their lives as happier had strong circles of family, friends and/or romantic partners. So, while spending time with the special people in your life may not be enough to make you happy, it certainly plays a major role. After all, by sharing your life with others, you invite them to share their lives with you. You open your thoughts, feelings and experiences to the people around you. Such exchanges increase the meaning of life as sharing joy is a pleasurable experience, and sharing sorrow can be comforting during painful times. Friends are great for that, but stable and fulfilling romantic relationships also have a profound impact on happiness levels. While researching human well-being, the psychology professor David Myers found that a deep, caring and intimate lifelong relationship is one of the best predictors of happiness. This correlation is only logical because when people love each other unconditionally and feel loved for being exactly who they are, they’re free to express their true selves. But to be successful, romantic relationships need to hold both pleasure and meaning. A hedonistic relationship that's solely focused on pleasure and lust will rapidly lose its meaning, while a relationship based on shared values but lacking pleasure will also struggle. Balance is key. The key message in this book: Happiness is the greatest human goal, and anyone can find it by identifying what really matters in their life. Such clarity can be used to create a life that’s full of pleasure and purpose, leading you to accomplish your ultimate wishes. Actionable Advice Boost Your Happiness Level Write a list of things that bring you joy. These are your happiness boosters: a general booster brings you instant happiness while an explanatory booster is something you think about but aren’t sure will make you happier – like volunteering at a dog shelter or learning an instrument.

They think they’ll need to make some dramatic, scary life changes – quitting their job, for instance, or being more extroverted and practicing positive thinking 24/7. Well, they are wrong.  If you’re searching for a way to enjoy more ease and comfort, more cheerfulness and joy in your life, here’s the good news: tiny, seemingly negligible changes to your home, your lifestyle and the way you talk to your loved ones can add up to you being a much happier person. Reading these blinks, you’ll discover why your nose can reduce your anxiety; about a family with climbing ropes in their hallway; and how being more snail-like will help you live more happily. Get ready to start a nine-month project of happiness! Each month, you’ll focus on a different principle that can make your life at home more enjoyable. If you stick to it, this nine-month plan will have you enjoying your everyday routines and cherishing nearly every moment. Sound good? Then let’s get started! Creating a happier family is all about adapting your home to both your needs and the needs of each and every family member living there. For example, one particularly creative family with four children installed climbing ropes and monkey bars in their hallway. This made being at home all the more enjoyable – for both the kids and the parents! But before you can create a happier home, you need to figure out what needs changing. There are four things that will help you do that: First, you have to find out what makes you feel good at home. Is it the pictures or trinkets that remind you of your family? The smell? The lighting? Next, figure out the primary factors that make you feel bad at home. It could be anything, from major disturbances to a scary painting in your bedroom that keeps you awake at night. Third, ask yourself how you can feel right more often – that is, how you can develop a lifestyle, home and routine that reflect your values and align with what’s important to you. Finally, search for ways to develop an atmosphere of growth at home, an approach to life that keeps you focused on maintaining a go-get-’em attitude even after you’ve accomplished a goal. For instance, if something breaks in your home, you shouldn’t just fix it, but also adjust your behavior so that the problem doesn’t arise over and over again.  Now that you understand the fundamental goals of the nine-month project, our remaining blinks will explore exactly which actions you should take during that time. Is your home full of stuff that you keep around simply because it might come in handy one day? If you want a happy home, you might want to change that. To create a home that offers happiness and comfort, you should surround yourself with possessions that you truly know and cherish. Examine every object in every closet and every drawer and ask yourself: How often do I use this, and how much do I like it? If you don’t use or like it, get rid of it. Then get familiar with the things you decide to keep. For example, you should actually read the instruction manual for your coffeemaker or for your video camera (if you decide to keep these manuals). By familiarizing yourself with everything in your home, you’ll be both competent and comfortable dealing with (basically) any situation within it.  In addition, make sure that the things that matter most to you are in full view. The author, for example, transformed her home into a shrine to her family, displaying photographs of her loved ones throughout the house.  Decluttering your home isn’t just a way of improving your living space; it can also improve your family life. After a thorough decluttering, you’ll suddenly have more time to think clearly about what’s good for your family. Had the author constantly felt pressured to fix things around the home and clean up clutter, she probably would have forced her eldest daughter to take piano lessons just to get some time to herself. But she decluttered her life, getting rid of the things she didn’t need, and she had enough spare energy to address her daughter’s needs and realize that what her daughter really wanted was to make films and edit videos all day long. So, she gave her a book about film editing. Having a happy relationship with your loved ones means being happy yourself. Indeed, achieving a happy marriage is mostly a matter of understanding that nobody but you is responsible for your happiness. So, if you want a peaceful and relaxed marriage, try to be peaceful and relaxed yourself. Over time, partners will influence each other, copying each other’s language and habits. For example, if you quit smoking, your partner is 67 percent more likely to follow suit. Similarly, if you want a caring and affectionate relationship, be caring and affectionate yourself. Try kissing your partner more often, as kissing boosts feelings of intimacy, and at times says more than a thousand words. For example, when the author’s husband seemed preoccupied and distracted one evening, she gave him a long kiss instead of simply asking what was wrong. That was all he needed to cheer up and relax. These same principles apply the relationship you have with your children. Their happiness and self-esteem, and their behavior toward you and others, is bound to reflect the way you behave around them.   Rather than being a dramatic parent who makes a fuss about every little mistake, try to reassure your kid by underreacting to problems. As an example, when her eldest daughter dropped an open bottle of nail polish on the carpet, the author didn’t yell at her and make a mountain out of a molehill. Instead, she calmly told her daughter to search the internet for ways to remove the stain, and to clean it accordingly. In the end, the stain was gone, nobody was upset and her daughter even learned a new skill. Finally, it’s absolutely vital that you pay attention to each of your loved ones individually. One simple way to do this is acknowledging every family member whenever they leave or return home with a warm greeting. As you’ve learned, the less cluttered your home is, the happier you’ll be. But it’s also true that your general happiness can generate domestic happiness. So what else can you do to increase your personal feelings of joy? You can start by protecting yourself against unhappy people; such individuals can drain all the happiness out of you. Unlike happy people, who are enthusiastic, optimistic and full of energy, unhappy people are apathetic, plaintive and intent on making everyone in their life as miserable as they are. There are three types of happiness leeches: the needy and pessimistic grouches, the jerks who gossip and embarrass others and the slackers, who use feigned helplessness to get attention. Protecting yourself against happiness leeches of all varieties starts with the awareness that, while happiness is contagious, some people are simply immune to it. It’s impossible to cheer up a bona fide grouch, so don’t waste your time trying.  Furthermore, you can become happier if you learn to be mindful of the present moment by tuning in to your senses. A particular sense of smell, for example, can bring back pleasant memories, while also reconnecting you with what’s there right now.  For instance, if you ever feel yourself being overcome with anxiety, try sniffing lavender oil; this can bring you back to the (unthreatening) present moment. Third, if you want to feel good, you need to look good – and knowing yourself can help you look your best.  There are countless temptations, like indulging in unhealthy foods or smoking cigarettes. To resist these temptations, it helps to know which strategies are easiest for you to follow and then to act accordingly. Maybe you need to avoid temptation altogether (never eating those delicious Christmas cookies) or enjoy them in moderation (eating just one cookie at a time).  Family is something that you can never have too much of. And although your relationship with your spouse and children is what matters most, that doesn’t mean you have to abandon the family you grew up with.  Your parents and siblings are part of who you are, and connecting with them more often can improve your overall happiness. The author, for example, started working on a children’s book with her sister. Despite all the time and effort they had to devote to the project, they enjoyed the extra time they spent in each other’s company, and the project ultimately brought them closer together. Appreciation for your family is a wonderful feeling, and practicing gratitude can help you feel even closer to them. So develop habits that remind you of how grateful you are for your family. For instance, whenever you lie awake at night and everyone else is asleep, remind yourself of how grateful you are to be at home, surrounded by the people you cherish most. Moreover, getting to know your neighborhood can broaden the feeling of having a big and happy family. Deepening your connection with your neighborhood will make you feel even more at home. Start with the places and buildings. For example, you could take a walk through your neighborhood and try to learn more about the landmarks in your area.  While you’re out, try to remember personal events that are connected to specific places in your neighborhood, like how you and your family once took a special walk down a certain street. But your neighborhood isn’t just a collection of streets and buildings. Get to know your neighbors, too, and treat them as if they were your family. Be considerate and affectionate, and help them out whenever you can. Remember: the bigger your family, the happier you’ll be. Snails may be slimy and generally pretty gross, but they do have one thing going for them: they get to bring their homes with them wherever they go. With the right perspective, you can do the same. If you truly know yourself, you can feel at home no matter where you are. In order to create a happier home, your private space must reflect the real you. But discovering who the “real you” is can be a difficult and even painful exercise, as it requires you to confront your own faults.  For instance, you may discover that, despite what you keep telling yourself, you actually dread family trips because you hate being away from home and sleeping in an unfamiliar bed. But both you and your family expect you to love these special outings! If your home is a reflection of who you are, then everything you find within your space can also be found in you as well. If your home is warm and welcoming, then that means you are, too.  In this way, it’s possible for you to carry the things you cherish most about your home – the memories and warmth and comfort – wherever you go. This way, you can feel at home anywhere. So when’s the best time to start your quest to feel happy at home, no matter where you are? Right now! If you’re like most people, you see happiness as something that you will strive for in the future. In fact, according to one study, when people were asked how they’d be in ten years, 95 percent expected their lives to be better than they are in the present. But it’s in your best interest not to postpone happiness. If you wait around too long, you might not ever have the chance to do what really makes you happy.  The key message in this book: Finding happiness in your everyday life requires you to develop a home that actually reflects your needs and the needs of your family. With a little soul searching and a few practical exercises, you can transform yourself and your home into generators of real happiness. Actionable advice: Always take the atmosphere of your home into consideration.  Next time you buying something for your home, ask yourself whether you really need it and whether your family will feel comfortable with it, or whether it will make you feel disconnected from your own values. This simple exercise will keep your home free of clutter, and also ensure a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere.  Suggested further reading: The Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin What is happiness and how can we bring more of it into our lives? Gretchen Rubin asked herself this question because although she fulfilled all the prerequisites for a happy life – an intact family, a good job and enough money for a rainy day – she found herself frequently unhappy. During her year-long Happiness Project, she read about various techniques and theories on increasing happiness and tried to become happier with their help. Got feedback?

We tend to think it’s something we either have or don’t have – something that can mysteriously materialize and just as mysteriously vanish. And this belief, that luck is something you can’t influence, is enough to make one feel more than fatalistic. But despair not – because being lucky isn’t just a matter of, well, luck. These blinks explain the basic tenets of luck. You’ll learn how and where it happens, as well as how to manifest more of it in your daily life. Arming yourself with knowledge on how you can influence luck will increase your chances of success and happiness. Good luck! In these blinks, you’ll learn how to stand out from the crowd; what a Fosbury Flop is; and how to avoid bad luck. There’s a common misconception that luck lies beyond our control – and that it occurs randomly. In reality, however, it’s much more tangible than that. Luck is not the same thing as chance, but chance does play a part in luck. Equating the two is probably the biggest mistake people make. It’s important to understand that while chance is totally out of our control, it’s always accompanied by other factors that we can control. In fact, luck is the result of chance meeting talent and hard work, and increasing your luck involves preparation and the ability to seize opportunities. For instance, let’s say that, by chance, you get seated next to an investor at a dinner party and that, after pitching your idea to her, she decides to provide you with the initial capital to start your company. Now, some people would call this a random stroke of luck. But notice that there are two parts to it: the seating arrangement and how you handle the seating arrangement.  The first part is chance. The second, which depends on your ability to pitch your idea to anyone at any time, is preparation. Together, they both combine to generate luck. Having established that chance events are completely out of your control, you should thus ignore them and focus instead on what you can influence – that is, luck. Think of luck as a slot machine: if you can ensure that two out of three cherries are always lined up – by being curious and working hard – then it’s much more likely that that third cherry will, at some point, fall into place. Most of us are actually already aware of this. In a national survey conducted by the authors, 67 percent of respondents believed that hard work played a role in luck in their lives, and 64 percent thought that luck depended on curiosity and seeking out opportunities. So, as you now know, there is a lot more to luck than just random chance. In the upcoming blinks, you’ll learn how to exert control and increase your chances of getting lucky. Everyone wants luck on their side, and the good news is that there are a few ways to help you transform your day-to-day approach to life and improve your luck. The first method is to be persistent and passionate about your ideas. With enough determination and hard work, you will eventually find the break you need. Luck presents itself to those who continue hanging around even after the majority have given up – people like best-selling author John Grisham, who didn’t give up even though he was rejected by 28 publishers. Today, he’s sold over 275 million books globally. Persistence and passion may help, but to be truly effective, they must be combined with placement – that is, putting yourself where luck will be. This method is used by ice-hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, who explained that his high scoring rate was due to the strategy of skating “where the puck is going, not where it’s been.” Likewise, if you put yourself in places where opportunities are likely to arise, you’ll increase your probability of success. This is why aspiring actors move to Hollywood and why most tech start-ups are based in Silicon Valley. These methods may increase your luck, but, unfortunately, you’re not the only one who’s persistent, passionate and placing yourself in high-opportunity environments. So to stand out from the crowd, you need to start thinking differently. In the 1960s, athlete Dick Fosbury developed a unique approach to his high jump and improved his performance by six inches. Fosbury’s awkward, midair rotation became known as the Fosbury Flop, and even though experts dismissed it at first, the Flop landed him a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics. Eventually, the experts and fellow high-jumpers caught up with Fosbury’s “weird” technique – the Fosbury Flop has been the technique used by every gold medalist since 1972. Go against the flow, and with enough persistence and clever placement, you’ll be well on your way to getting luck on your side. There are several techniques you can adopt in your life that will help you be ready when an opportunity comes knocking. The first is to establish a wide network of acquaintances. The possibility of new opportunities is greater when you’re around people you hardly know, as opposed to your close network of friends and family, a phenomenon the sociologist Mark Granovetter calls the strength of weak ties. When you know what kind of lucky break you’re after, communicating this to every new face you meet will eventually lead you to the right person – someone who can, for example, set you up with an interview at your dream company. The second technique is to diversify your life. You never know what will pay off, so having multiple activities will increase the likelihood of success. Furthermore, if one opportunity begins to crumble, you’ll have plenty of others that are doing well. For instance, when fashion designer Kate Spade quit her editing job to start a company with her then boyfriend, Andy Spade, he continued to take on jobs in the advertising industry. The extra support and income allowed them to keep pushing and innovating on their fashion company until they finally got that lucky break. The thing with lucky breaks is that they can start out small – so you need to be able to spot them. In 1928, physician and microbiologist Alexander Fleming returned to his laboratory after a long vacation to find that a strange bacteria-killing mold had somehow entered his office and fallen into a petri dish. While many people would have thrown out this invader, Fleming knew its potential importance. Only because he’d done lots of research beforehand was Fleming able to see what was happening, and his observation led to his discovery of the bacteria-killing drug penicillin, which won him a Nobel Prize in 1945. Now that you know how to increase your luck, let’s move on to some practical examples that can be applied to everyday life. There’s a legend about the investment firm Goldman Sachs. Apparently, the applications of first-year analysts are divided into two piles: one pile will be considered; the other will go into the trash. And, according to the hiring personnel, you’ve simply got to be lucky. So how do you avoid the wastebasket and ensure that you’re in the lucky pile? Well, no matter what position you’re trying to land, you should always aim to be in a third pile – that is, a pile that consists of select candidates that are already being considered because they stand out. Remember the strength of weak ties? Those ties are the key to getting into the third pile. For example, having a family member at the company you want to work for would be a huge advantage. This seems unfair, but, really, it’s a matter of placement. You’ve got to find people who can elevate you above the pack. According to Jack, an e-commerce executive with whom the authors spoke, a show of effort is what informs hiring decisions. Jack said that he had been swamped with many impressive applications when looking to hire around 20 people. Ultimately, he hired those who’d shown the effort to contact him personally, or who’d gone the extra mile to find someone to recommend them. Those who put in the effort to get the position are the candidates who stand out. However, a recommendation is not enough for success; you also have to maximize your opportunities. All three costars of the TV series Girls had an unfair advantage in the casting process – each either had famous parents or already knew the show’s creator. However, none of them took these advantages for granted and instead worked hard on proving that they were the best candidates for the job, resulting in the show’s great success. Next up, we’ll look at how you can influence your luck in the realm of romance. People often talk about how lucky they are to have found the perfect partner. But what they don’t realize is that there’s much more to the pairing than pure chance. To find the right person, you need to be in the right place. As previously mentioned, to increase your luck you need to put yourself in places where opportunities are abundant. This also applies to meeting potential partners. So, for example, if you love art, you should go to galleries and see who you meet. You should also know that the strength of your connection with somebody is more in your control than simply improving your odds. For example, you’re more likely to meet someone at a friend’s wedding of 125 guests than you are at a football game among a crowd of 20,000 fans. So, when you’re looking to find a good partner, you shouldn’t just head off to any place where lots of people gather. After you meet that somebody great, it’s important to remember that the “perfect” person does not exist. We’re all human, and we’re all flawed, and sometimes the flaws of our partner may lead us to seek perfection elsewhere. Psychologist Dr. Barry Schwartz says that the problem stems from the paradox of choice, which is when you have too many alternatives and, as a result, end up focusing on what you don’t have. This may reduce satisfaction with something that is otherwise a good fit for you. And consider the findings of a national survey conducted by the authors. When asked what it means to be lucky in love, only seven percent of respondents said it’s about finding the perfect person, whereas 80 percent said it comes from paying attention to the other person’s needs as much as your own. Thus, you should think of love as an exciting investment, not something you “settle” for. Given enough time and effort, you can cultivate a strong relationship that will make you feel truly lucky in love. Being lucky in love doesn’t simply fall out of the sky – you’ve got to work at it and build it up. Lucky children are happy children, and you can make your kids luckier by teaching them the principles covered in the previous blinks. To increase a child’s luck, you should show them the wealth of opportunities available to them, while refraining from forcing them down any particular path. Dr. Jessica Levenstein, from the Horace Mann School, in New York, believes that children (and, by extension, adults) will be happier if they believe their lives are governed by their own actions, as opposed to by external actors. She explains that parents who refuse to allow their children to be educated by specific teachers – because, say, that teacher has a poor reputation – often stifle their children’s independence and learning. For instance, the author once wanted to change her son’s teacher, but was encouraged by the school principal to approach the situation with a positive attitude and not get involved. Ultimately, her son and his teacher ended up getting along well and being a great fit for one another. The author also talks about her own father’s habit of ignoring her report cards, and concerning himself instead with how she felt she had done. By letting children see the effects of their own efforts, even if those efforts are mistakes, they’re able to learn a lot about themselves and the world. Another thing you can teach children is that they don’t have to follow conventional paths. In high school, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded a tiny data-analysis business that didn’t really succeed but nonetheless went on to form the basis of Microsoft. Gates was amazed that his father, who had spoken with the headmaster, gave him the go-ahead rather than pushing him to focus on his studies. By allowing him to pursue seemingly unimportant adventures, his parents allowed the space to develop the self-belief that would later make him the successful and lucky billionaire we know today. As you can see, it’s extremely important to build the foundations of success by showing children that they have control over their own decisions. Sometimes, bad luck likes to show up unannounced at your door. But preventing bad luck is similar to encouraging good luck – you’ve got to be prepared and you’ve got to approach situations intelligently. Preparation is the best way to reduce the severity of natural misfortune. And it’s usually best to start small. For instance, when dealing with health, you should focus on the little things that can be controlled, rather than worrying about highly unlikely outcomes. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health discovered that, every year, over a million Americans die prematurely due to weight issues, smoking or high blood pressure. These causes are usually preventable through individual choices. It’s absurd that we worry about things like shark attacks and the Ebola virus – which are extremely unlikely to ever affect us – while showing almost no concern about car accidents, which kill almost 100 Americans every day. When it comes to unfortunate disasters, whether human-made or natural, a little precaution can go a long way. We should be a bit more humble and suspicious of chance. Why not spend a few moments checking the fire escapes in new hotels or buildings, or making sure that you always take heed of fire alarms. Often, people die due to complacency. Bad luck can also be avoided by controlling your reactions. More specifically, you can turn bad luck into good with a positive outlook. Author Lee Child was fired from a job that he held for 13 years. But instead of moaning about his bad fortune, he channeled his frustration into creating the bestselling Jack Reacher novels. This is described by the coauthor as the local hill-climbing strategy: in order to reach for a mountain peak higher than the one you’re currently climbing, you must often first descend into a valley. Hard work isn’t only a way to improve good luck; it can help you make the best out of bad luck, too. The key message in this book: Luck is more in our control than we think. By following the principles outlined here – that is, combining hard work, talent and chance, and preparing and putting yourself in places where opportunity is likely to strike – you can increase your susceptibility to luck. Actionable advice: Steer through life with a compass, not a map. To find the places where the opportunities to become lucky are high, you need to have a plan. But an overly rigid plan – that is, clearly defined life map – can cause you to miss those important opportunities. So trade out your map for a compass. If you know the general direction you wish to go in, you will be able to adapt if the landscape changes around you. It requires courage and self-confidence, but walking your own path will lead you to opportunities that might just change your luck. Got feedback?

These might be expectations from parents or teachers or society at large. Growing up in rural England, Robert Webb experienced what it's like to be a teenage boy who’s expected to love sports, shun all intellectual pursuits and be so full of raging hormones that he couldn’t possibly be taught how to hold a productive conversation. Meanwhile, there’s a whole list of things that boys aren’t expected to be, such as emotionally sensitive. If you think this sounds like a recipe for legions of horrible boyfriends – well, it is! But against all the odds, Webb managed to stay intellectually curious, make it through Cambridge University and become an internationally respected comedy writer and actor. He’s perhaps best known as one of the stars of the long-running television show Peep Show, which has brought viewers on a hilarious and sometimes frightening journey inside the heads of its two lead characters, Mark and Jeremy. Robert Webb is here to tell everyone that there’s no such thing as a “male brain” that’s responsible for making men behave in typically male ways. These so-called typical male behaviors are the result of generations of outdated expectations. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the right pair of socks can be very important; which Prince song Webb will never forget; and how not to play chess. No one sets out to be a bad parent, but some of them can be appallingly stubborn in how they reinforce gender stereotypes. It’s common for a parent to say, “Oh, Sally is such a girl. One day, a boy tried to get her to play with an action figure, and she just put a dress on it and tucked it into bed!” What many parents don’t understand is that a child may adopt certain stereotypical behaviors, but that this doesn’t mean they’re biologically determined to behave this way. Whether parents want to admit it or not, most cognitive and behavioral traits are not biological or gender-related at all. In fact, there’s no such thing as a “male brain” or a “female brain.” In November of 2015, an article in Science magazine explained how neuroscientists determined that all brains are unique, and therefore can’t be categorized by gender. So, if a boy doesn’t want to wear a pink sweater, this isn´t because of biology. Chances are, any recognizable gender differences are the result of social expectations. In her book Delusions of Gender, psychologist Cordelia Fine points to a study from 2000 that shows just how biased society is about gender. In the study, mothers were asked to examine a sloped walkway that had an adjustable level for how steep it could be. Their task was to judge the steepness and try to determine whether their eleven-month-old toddler could succeed in climbing it. The results showed that mothers consistently underestimated the girls’ ability to successfully climb slopes that were quite steep. Conversely, the mothers routinely overestimated the ability of the boys, expecting them to be able to climb slopes that often proved to be too steep. With gender biases like these in society, is it any wonder that men and women will grow up to have different personalities? Here’s some food for thought: women have been comfortable wearing pants for around a century or so, but it’s still generally unacceptable for men to wear a skirt or dress. Why is that? Indeed, the clothing boys are expected to wear is strictly regimented.   When Webb was ten years old, a dramatic crisis ensued when his Aunt Tru tried to give him the wrong socks before a soccer match. They were girl socks – can you imagine!? Young Webb was flabbergasted that his aunt couldn’t tell the difference. Distraught, Webb tried to explain that, first of all, they were clearly too long and, second, they had a pattern printed on them! Didn’t she know that the only acceptable socks on a playground are plain white with, at most, a black stripe or two at the top? Sure enough, poor Webb was ridiculed mercilessly as soon as his playmate, Matthew Tellis, spotted the socks. He began laughing, pointing and calling Webb a girl. Immediately, the other boys gathered around and joined in the fun. Since the strict male dress code is enforced at a young age by terrible bullying, most boys learn to defend themselves swiftly and decisively in such situations. Webb was no exception. He immediately countered Matthew’s taunts by suggesting that he would probably like the socks better if they were covered in shit. This was a rather cutting remark since it referenced an incident especially embarrassing to Matthew.  Once, during class, Matthew had to go to the bathroom, and the teacher let him leave on the condition that he return in 20 seconds. Matthew, knowing that the teacher was in a bad mood, took this 20 seconds far too seriously, cut his business in the boy’s room short and returned with a bit of that business on his pants. It was a masterstroke of playground politics on Webb’s part. He deflected the attack upon his socks and successfully shifted everyone’s attention onto the unforgettable day of Matthew’s soiled trousers. But none of this would’ve been necessary if it hadn't been for society’s useless gender stereotypes. It might seem ridiculous, but many pregnant women still have to deal with people who assume that they’re preparing to give up their career now that a baby is on the way. And there are still those who look on in amazement when they see a man in a coffee shop looking after his toddler. So it’s safe to say that people still buy into absurd stereotypes about gender. The absurdity of these beliefs becomes especially apparent when you compare them to previously widespread misconceptions about race and religion. For example, it’s not uncommon to hear people say things like, “Mark is like all boys, he can never sit quietly.” And, “Sure, boys can learn to enjoy reading, but it doesn’t happen naturally.” Or how about: “What’s great about men is that they’re so straightforward and uncomplicated – none of those messy emotions to deal with.” Now, instead of males, imagine if someone was saying these very same things about Muslims or Asian people. You’d probably consider it unacceptable, and that’s how it should be considered, no matter who’s being stereotyped. Anybody who knows about human nature knows that generalizations like these are simply wrong. For example, Webb’s brother Mark is a man who closely matches what society expects men to be: he’s a father, he coaches a local boy’s soccer team, he drives an Audi and he is a manager for an agricultural firm. At school, he was willing to get tough, and even violent, to make sure he was respected. However, Webb remembers Mark as also being very kind, the sort of person who would take the time to teach his younger brother how to sing and whistle. Mark also babysat his brother on nights when their mom was busy. And one night, he even kissed Webb goodnight – on his mouth! So don’t believe the ridiculous social stereotype that says men don’t have an emotional, nurturing and caring side. Because they most certainly do. There are some very particular, and often hilarious, expectations about male behavior. They’re expected to swagger, to be steely-eyed, to meet the world with a cocksure poker face – and they’re especially expected to do these things when meeting and dealing with other men. Even going back to childhood, there is a prescribed, rough-and-tumble manner in which boys are expected to interact. Webb grew up in rural England, with two older brothers. Sometimes, when Webb was seated at the kitchen table, his brother Andrew would walk behind him and give his head a push. Sometimes it was just a gentle nudge. Other times it was strong enough to dunk Webb’s head into his bowl of cereal. This kind of roughhousing was always done with affection, though, as were the ritual beatings the brothers would engage in every Tuesday afternoon. In Andrew’s room, the trio would engage in all sorts of play-fighting, which, more often than not, ended up with Webb banging his head against something quite hard and then pretending it didn’t hurt like hell. Furthermore, men certainly aren’t supposed to cry out in pain, just as they’re not supposed to be intellectually inclined. This supposed lack of cerebral leanings makes even less sense than the other rules since boys are expected to grow up and be in charge of things. Nevertheless, no schoolboy with aspirations to coolness would dare show a genuine desire to be intellectual, since all braininess is strictly uncool. The enduring assumption is that smart students can’t be good at practical things such as sports. Therefore, all things intellectual are considered unmanly. This goes hand in hand with the widespread belief that the hormones raging within every teenage boy make it hard for them to follow the rules or excel in the classroom. This faulty logic – that studying hard or enjoying intellectual pursuits are signs of effeminateness – can be quite detrimental to a young man’s academic career. Being bullied for getting high grades certainly doesn’t encourage the development of good study habits. One day, while riding the bus to a school outing, Webb was approached by his classmate Gareth, who was holding a chess board in his hands. Gareth wasn’t exactly the type of kid Webb would expect to play chess, but he agreed to play a game and started things off with the standard opening move of sending a pawn forward two squares. What happened next is a classic example of how poorly boys communicate. Gareth’s opening move was to send his queen out and place her right in the spot where Webb’s pawn had just moved from – a blatant violation of at least three or four different chess rules. Flummoxed, Webb couldn’t bring himself to tell Gareth that he’d made an invalid move, so he continued playing for a few more turns until Gareth crowed checkmate. But then Gareth wanted to play again, and Webb had to draw the line and refuse, leaving Gareth to walk away in a huff. This kind of situation plays out all the time between schoolboys. The logical thing, of course, would have been for Webb to pleasantly explain to Gareth how the game of chess is played. Gareth could then have expressed his gratitude, and the two boys could have enjoyed a nice game of chess. But such a conversation would have required a level of communicative skill that boys rarely reach. Unlike girls, boys aren’t expected to become experts in human interaction – yet another stereotype that has unfortunate consequences. Indeed, all too often, boys grow into men who avoid social contact and have trouble resolving conflicts. As an adult, Webb once chatted with a male friend who explained that his neighbors had been using his trash cans to get rid of their rubbish. But rather than having a conversation to resolve the conflict, the friend decided to pack up and move away! Sure, it was to a very similar house in the same neighborhood – but still, this is the level of avoidance a man will resort to in order to avoid conflict. Since boys are thought to be ill-equipped to learn good manners and conversational skills, they become men who either avoid conflict or get into fights. And since fighting is the more frowned-upon response, the only available option is avoidance. Not only can this result in a grown man moving away from his annoying neighbors; it can also lead to isolation and loneliness. Typically, teenage boys are strange creatures – all awkwardness and self-assertion, filled with both a horrible fear of sex and an overwhelming urge to experience it. Somehow, many boys still manage to get into a relationship at this stage, but having sex is no guarantee that things will get better. Male socialization often makes for bad boyfriends. When he was 17 years old, Webb began dating Isabel, his first girlfriend. For the first two weeks, things went pretty well, but then both Webb and Isabel were introduced to his awful boyfriend personality. Just how bad was Webb’s dark side? How about ignoring her at school, being overly critical of her friends and refusing to spend time with them, not laughing at any of her jokes and never asking one question about her life? Webb was dealing with a common situation: he was dating someone he wasn’t in love with. But since he had no communication skills, he didn’t know how to deal with it. To make matters worse, Isabel wrote him a heartfelt love letter that asked him if he was just in the relationship for the “Sunday sex” or if it was truly meaningful to him. An emotionally intelligent person would see this as an opportunity to be honest and politely break up. But, instead, the author responded with a love letter of his own, and Isabel believed him. This is one of the many societal plagues caused by male uncommunicativeness: bad boyfriends who can’t even break up properly. In this scenario, dumping Isabel was never an option, because that required a level of tact, bravery and willingness to forego sex that Webb did not have. So, instead, Webb wanted Isabel to break up with him. This way, he neither had to figure out how to make the relationship work nor give up the regular sex, all while insisting on doing everything his way. So Webb just waited until Isabel was fed up with his refusal to have productive conversations, or engage in anything beyond sex, and finally dumped him. Have you ever seen a grown man cry? Maybe it happened once, when a guy you know was overcome by emotion during a movie or a Bruce Springsteen song. Even if you have witnessed this rare sight, chances are that the man in question didn’t want you to see him engaged in such a quintessentially unmanly activity. But on their own, behind closed doors, men are free to do all sorts of unmanly things, including bawling their eyes out. Once, when we was 17, Webb found himself laying in bed with his friend Will and crying. Webb’s mother had recently died of cancer and, at this moment in bed next to his friend, the reality of her death finally hit him. It was fortunate for Webb that Will wasn’t someone who held on to strict rules about masculinity. Will not only didn’t run away from the situation; he actually held his hand and comforted him, while the Prince song “Sometimes it Snows in April” played on the stereo. When they feel safe and comfortable, men will do more than cry. Sometimes, they’ll even explore their sexuality. Yes, even a straight man can have sex with another man – especially if it’s a man you’ve had a crush on for a long time, as Webb did on Will. Now, lying in bed together, something extraordinary began to happen and no amount of testosterone was going to prevent it from going further. It may have been a matter of curiosity, or just tender and affectionate sympathy on Will’s part, but when Webb touched Will in a sexual way, he didn’t resist. Years later, the two would meet again and Webb didn’t resist when Will touched him. These encounters weren’t exactly steaming-hot sex, but both men shared intense, loving feelings for one another. The romance eventually ended when Will fell in love with a woman, but the two of them managed to remain friends and enjoy road trips together through rural Lincolnshire. They’d engage in heated cultural debates, and crack each other up while trying to see who could come up with the best impressions of their mutual friends. It can be a cringeworthy moment to see a woman get berated by a man, only to have her uncomfortably smile and say, “That’s just his way of saying ‘I love you.’” However, there is some truth to this stereotypical scenario, as it’s yet another example of how bad men are at communicating their emotions. Following the death of his mother, Webb decided to stay at his father’s house for a while, which meant parting ways with his stepfather, Derek, and his younger sister, Anna-Beth. This decision saddened Derek because he was going to miss having Webb around, but rather than explaining his feelings, he made Webb feel guilty by saying that Anna was going to be lonely without him. But the worst was that he said Webb’s mother would have wanted Webb to stay at home. This guilt trip just made the author angry, and it certainly didn’t make him change his plan to move in with his biological dad. But as he was walking out the door, Webb did catch the genuine sadness in Derek’s voice when he said, “We’ll miss yer.” Of course, Webb should have known that in going from one dad to the next, he’d still be dealing with the strained communications of two men trying to have a conversation. In the case of his biological father, Webb was faced with a different kind of man – one who was obsessively organized. As he got older, his dad’s fussiness grew to alarming levels: there were endless household chores to be dealt with, like making the empty milk bottles spotless before they could be put outside the door for the milkman. And immediately after each bath, the tub had to be scrubbed clean. This was just the tip of the iceberg, and the pressure from all this fussiness led to their interactions often ending in the honored tradition known to many men: angry words and slamming doors. After he moved out of his father’s home and began attending Cambridge University, Webb went on to become the actor and comedian we know today. And now, as a writer and a father, he knows that being a man doesn’t have to mean you’re a bad communicator. The key message in this book: Despite all the discussion around gender, we still live in a world where boys are not supposed to be different, intellectual, emotional or good at social connection. As a result of our still too narrow conceptions of masculinity a lot of men don’t know how to be honest about their feelings, struggle with social connections and can even become tyrannically overorganized. By insisting that it’s ok for men not to be interested in typically “male” pursuits, that it’s perfectly normal for men to cry and show their emotions, we can give our idea of masculinity a much needed overhaul. Actionable advice: Guys, be aware of physical disparities when you flirt. Remember that, as a man, you are typically physically stronger than the woman you are flirting with. If you have trouble putting yourself in her shoes, imagine what it would be like to have a huge, very strong gay guy start hitting on you insistently. Imagine how disconcerting it would be if he started leaning into you, grabbing you or even just not taking no for an answer. Remember this the next time you try to flirt with someone who is more “petite” than you are. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Of course, not every day can be as smooth sailing as this. But if you follow the advice offered in these blinks, you can turn almost every day into at least a good day; you’ll feel good about yourself because you get things done, focus without too much effort and bravely withstand the urge to procrastinate. On top of that, you’ll feel comfortable among your colleagues and, when giving a presentation, you’ll find that your audience really listens to you. Sound good? Then let’s get started! In these blinks, you’ll learn why thinking about a past catastrophe can boost our confidence today; how the schedules of top violinists, master chess players and elite athletes are alike; and why your interest in sports could earn you a job in a totally unrelated field. Have you ever found yourself nearing the end of a day and feeling as if it had been completely wasted? Here are a few tips to help minimize that feeling. First, clearly set out your intentions for each day and try to eliminate any activities you know tend to distract you from achieving them. For instance, one of the author’s clients, Martin, is the strategy director of an aircraft manufacturer. He noticed that whenever he felt overwhelmed with his daily tasks, he would turn by default to distracting habits like checking news websites. So, to increase productivity, identify what those distracting habits are for you and put extra focus on avoiding them. Keep your sights on the day’s goals. Second, frame your goals in positive language. Goals framed positively can also be called approach goals – that is, goals that state the positive outcome you’re hoping to achieve, such as “make my product irresistible.” The contrast to this would be an avoidance goal, like “stop losing customers.” There is research to back up the benefits of this strategy: a 1997 study found that students using approach goals improved their performance, whereas the opposite was true for those using avoidance goals. Third, make a when-then plan to prepare for obstacles that could come between you and your goals. Take the author, who is not naturally an early bird. When she founded her own consulting business and no longer had a boss expecting her at work at nine in the morning, she was tempted to sleep in and while away her mornings. So she committed to a when-then plan to overcome this obstacle: when I wake up, first I’ll take a short walk, then I’ll check my e-mails. This little rule helps get her out of bed and face each day in a good mood. Crammed calendars and full to-do lists at work make it easy to feel overwhelmed. Let’s look at some of the ways to deal with these situations. First, the physical: lean back on a couch, exercise ball or even your office chair for a few minutes and focus on your breath until you’ve calmed down enough to think clearly. Then, to order your chaos into manageable chunks, make a plan and decide where to start. First, write down everything you need to do in the next few days or weeks. Mark the most important tasks and take one step toward completing that task today, no matter how small it is. Let’s take Angela as a case study. Angela was an attorney who wanted to run for a post in her company, which self-elects rather than appoints managers. However, the task of “start election prep” always felt too daunting. The enormity of those three words gave her anxiety, so she kept avoiding the task and procrastinating. What eventually worked for her was splitting the task into smaller steps, breaking it down into something like, “have a talk with my boss about my idea.” Once she’d split up the big task into small, manageable steps, “election prep” became much less overwhelming and she was able to tackle it. Another essential prerequisite for focus is scheduling breaks at least every hour and a half. Focus inevitably wavers throughout the day and needs to be recharged periodically. Over the course of 90 minutes, our brains go from highly focused to scatterbrained, which is why we end up doodling or playing on our phone if we’re forced to concentrate for longer. When famed psychologist K. Anders Ericsson studied people at the top of their fields, like world-class violinists, athletes and chess players, he found that they also practiced in blocks of 90 minutes or less, with short breaks in between. Getting along with the people around you is essential for getting the best out of your day. Here’s how to kick-start those relationships! First, build rapport when you interact with someone at work. Don’t just awkwardly slip by them in the office kitchen when you’re both reaching for a mug – engage them and ask open questions like, “how are you spending your holidays?” Find commonalities or shared areas of interest by showing a genuine curiosity in your coworkers, as well any other people you meet. Creating this sense of connection is important because it creates a culture of trust and collaboration in the workplace. Highlighting shared interests is also important when looking for work, as employers are more likely to hire people they share similarities with. Let’s take a look at a study conducted by sociologist Lauren Rivera from Northwestern University, where she asked recruiting managers about their most recent hires. She found that 74 percent admitted feeling some similarities with their new hires, whether it was based on a shared interest in sports, technology or something else. This indicates that managers prefer to hire and be around people with whom they share commonalities. To have a good day, it’s also important to address and resolve any tensions with coworkers, as they can really sap your enthusiasm. The best way to go about this is to openly explain to your coworker what you’re feeling and why in a polite but firm manner. For example, let’s take Simon, a real estate advisor who was annoyed with a client who kept promising him specific assignments but rarely followed through with them when the time came. Instead of reproaching his client or bottling up his frustration, Simon was up-front and communicated how he felt: “I’m confused because I received positive feedback from you, but didn’t get the project. Would you mind telling me what you were dissatisfied with and what I can do better next time?” This approach helped his client understand him without feeling attacked and getting defensive, and they ended up having an in-depth discussion about what the client was looking for. Do you struggle with making difficult decisions because they make you feel overwhelmed? The next time you feel this way, try these simple steps: First, develop a versatile routine that helps you reach sound decisions in all manner of situations. The routine might be as simple as asking yourself a set of questions like, “what are the alternatives and potential disadvantages to this choice?” or “what would the worst-case scenario be, and what are some of my options if that happens?” Peggy is an advertising art director who developed a routine that works for her. Her trick is to always invite colleagues to give her feedback about her current work. While she doesn’t agree with them all the time, their input often helps her catch potential problems in her campaigns, thereby improving her decisions. Remember, good advice can come from anyone, not just experts. Peggy once received valuable feedback from someone in customer support about an air freshener campaign. The support representative had on-the-ground knowledge suggesting that customers didn’t understand the visuals of the campaign, and Peggy was able to adjust accordingly. Another tip for optimizing your problem-solving skills is to break down a complex problem with an issue tree. Start by jotting down the key issue – let’s say your business is doing poorly, which might make your central question, “how can I increase profits?” That question is now the trunk of the tree. Now, write down the two possible options that form the branches of the tree, in this case increasing revenues or reducing costs. Then, think of concrete actions that would help you realize those options; for instance, you could dismiss employees to decrease costs, or launch a new product to increase revenue. These suggestions make up more branches of the issue tree, until eventually you’ll have systematically mapped out many potential next actions you can take to tackle your problem. Have you ever been giving a presentation, only to look around and see that most of the audience wasn’t actually listening? To avoid this in the future, just follow these simple techniques. First, remember that your audience will be much more receptive if you involve them and make them feel as if they’re choosing what to learn. For instance, Emma organizes training programs covering new pedagogical techniques for teachers. In the past, it was hard to get any of the participants to deviate from their own, entrenched methods, thus making it difficult to get anyone to actively listen during the training session. So Emma tried a new type of meeting, in which ten teachers each presented their own methods at different stations around the table. Participants were then free to walk around and stop by the stations they were interested in. Emma’s strategy gave the teachers more agency in terms of what to learn, which in turn made them much more enthusiastic about the training. Second, make your presentation interesting by incorporating videos or posters that will keep the audience on their toes. Make sure to utilize a whiteboard if there is one; people will internalize much more of your message if you draw and write in real time, rather than just using prepared slides. An experiment at Stanford University showed that people will recall nine percent more of a chart’s content if they see how it comes together as it is drawn, rather than just seeing the completed chart on a slide. And throughout it all, make sure to use short and simple sentences in a fluid manner to hold your audience’s attention and emphasize why your audience should care about what you’re telling them. It’s Monday, you’re tired and longing for the weekend already – but you’ve got a meeting with a dissatisfied customer first thing in the morning. What do you do? First, keep your cool by taking some distance from the situation. Imagine it’s not you but a friend who has to face the client. What advice would you give? You can take this even further by talking to yourself in the second person to gain a more distant perspective. Next, think of a past situation you handled well and ask yourself what resources helped you then. Maybe it was your wit, fearlessness or supportive friends, all of which can probably help you through the present situation, too! Let’s take Jacquie, a college PR officer, as an example. Once, an earthquake cut off her college’s power and water supplies. But instead of seeing it as a disaster, Jacqui spun the earthquake into a positive PR story for the school. The school still managed to hold a graduation ceremony amidst destroyed buildings, a story that the national media covered as a success story of perseverance and community – thanks in large part to Jacqui’s attitude and skills in dealing with the media. Thinking back to how she managed that situation continues to make Jacquie feel like she can handle anything. Turning to positive thoughts in challenging times is another surefire way to inject some energy and cheer into your day. Try out these tricks next time you’re in a tough situation. Start by identifying the mental, physical and temporal patterns and triggers that affect the ebb and flow of your energy. Maybe, for example, you always feel lethargic after lunch. Then, find ways to boost your energy during the energy lows. Maybe it’s getting up to make a cup of tea, having a five-minute chat with a coworker or taking a walk around the block. You can even try a gratitude exercise: think of three things that happened to you today that you’re grateful for, even if it’s just a small thing like remembering your umbrella – or forgetting it, and running like a little kid through the rain! Even small thoughts like this can make a big difference. The key message in this book: It’s normal to feel exhausted at times, but developing positive routines, learning from the past and connecting with colleagues are all good ways to make the most of your waking hours. Know yourself well enough to recognize what you might need to help boost your energy, and you can turn almost any day into a good day. Actionable Advice Cut back on e-mail Every time you check your inbox, you interrupt the work you’ve been doing; it also takes additional time to refocus once you try to get back to your work. This amounts to lots of lost time over the course of a day, so set a few times during the day – or even just one – that you check your inbox, and keep it closed at all other times to keep your productivity high.

Chances are, then, that you’ve already consulted a few self-help books or manuals on how to maximize your skill set. These manuals probably advised you that, first of all, you have to change in some fundamental way. If you’re an introvert, you should become the life of the party in six simple steps; if you’re a creative, somewhat chaotic person, you were probably told to stay organized, keep your desk clean and follow strict schedules. Well, did it work? Not likely. This is exactly the approach you won’t find in these blinks. The truth is, you don’t need to change at all! The key to being successful is to find out who you really are and then create the perfect niche that matches your unique traits and talents. In these blinks, you’ll find out the connection between an unnamed Mesopotamian from 3500 BC and Steve Jobs; why you might be a bit like a long-last artistic masterpiece; and how your efforts to sell your groundbreaking ideas are like the attention span of a goldfish. Perhaps you’ve heard this story: a priceless painting is sitting up in some forgotten attic, collecting dust for decades. Then, one day, someone stumbles upon it and sets off a million-dollar bidding war. Do you ever feel like that painting, waiting for someone to recognize your potential? The problem is, you have to be in the right environment for people to notice your unique talents and the great things you have to offer. Take Joshua Bell. He’s one of the world’s most famous violinists – but even a musical genius needs the right environment. He participated in an experiment in which he busked anonymously in a Washington, D.C., subway station. While he played, the people passing through the station were naturally caught up in their daily routines and failed to notice his amazing talent. In the end, he only made $32.12 whereas, under normal circumstances, he could easily earn $45,000 for a single performance. So, whether it is a priceless painting, Joshua Bell or you, without the right environment your talent will go unnoticed. You need to stay on the lookout for the kind of environment that will maximize your unique contributions. Luckily, there are some simple indicators that can tell you when you’ve found it – or if you might already be there. A good sign is when your boss approaches you to ask for your feedback and advice. The same goes for when clients decide to work with you rather than with more affordable competitors; this shows you that your good work is being recognized. On the other hand, you might not be in the right environment if your emails and calls are going unreturned. And if you’re self-employed, it should raise a red flag if you have to attract clients by offering the lowest price. So, finding the right environment is crucial to success, and in the next blink we’ll take a look at the obstacles that can stand in your way. Let’s say you’ve finally finished that novel you’ve been working on. How can you get it published and get on your way to becoming a famous author? There are three things you must be aware of. First, you have to overcome the distractions that can keep people from connecting with your ideas. It’s difficult to get someone to pay attention to your ideas if they don’t listen or bother to look at the portfolio you sent them. So, to get your message out there, you have to grab their attention right off the bat. Sadly, the average attention span has shrunk to a mere nine seconds! So, if you want to have an impact on your audience, you have to act quickly and start strong. And if you’re trying to sell that novel, one way to grab a publisher’s attention is to start the book off with a memorable and captivating opening. Second, avoid the competition by creating your own niche. There are plenty of competitive entrepreneurs out there today, each fighting to be the best in their field. But no matter how hard they try, there will always be someone better. You’re best off avoiding the desire to outperform everyone by trying to be the world’s best. Instead, you should aim for success by being different and creating a niche that plays to your own unique set of skills. Rather than trying to top Ernest Hemingway, embrace your own quirky writing style or subject matter and attract readers by setting yourself apart from the rest. Finally, avoid being perceived as a commodity. Commodities are replaceable and thus, if you’re perceived as one, you’ll end up losing clients to competitors. To find long-term success, you need a loyal customer base; otherwise, you’ll always be searching for new ones, which is a costly and time-consuming process. To retain your customers, become the opposite of a commodity – become someone special to them. You can do this by connecting with your customers and showing them that you care. If you encounter a complaint, respond personally. And if you get a letter from a reader, reply thoughtfully and start building a loyal fan base. Are there things in your life that fascinate you and allow you to forget the world around you? Fascination allows you to enter a state of flow, a psychological state in which you can focus on something completely. The stronger your fascination, the more likely you are to enter into this state. Flow was discovered by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who defined it as being completely, blissfully and effortlessly immersed in an activity. And this could be any activity: solving a crossword puzzle, doing woodwork or having a deep conversation with a friend. More importantly, being in a state of flow allows your brain to perform more efficiently, which improves your performance. Neuroscientists have shown this by comparing the brain activity of expert golfers and novices as the two groups imagined performing a golf swing. As they took their imaginary swings, the experts were able to focus effortlessly and enter the state of flow. This same efficiency appeared in the experiment’s brain imaging: the experts showed relatively low brain activity while the novices struggled hard to focus on the task and, consequently, showed relatively high brain activity. If a simple job already taxes your brainpower, as it did with these novices, more demanding tasks can overwhelm you, leading you to make mistakes or crumble under the pressure. But someone who is fascinated with what they do will enter a state of flow and will still have enough spare brainpower to meet a challenge. And fascination can be contagious as well. You may have heard of actors and musicians saying they are at the top of their game when they perform alongside the best in their field. This is because fascination and flow are contagious to those around us. Of course, the activities that are most likely to fascinate you are those that suit your unique personality traits. Let’s take a closer look at this important factor in the next blink. Were you ever scolded as a child for doing what came naturally? Perhaps you were too bossy, too cautious or too hyperactive. But childhood traits like these could prove to be the foundation for your greatest strengths, or your fascination advantages. There are seven fascination advantages and each of them has a unique way of helping you perform better. Many people struggle to become someone they’re not – to try and get a job or fit into a role that doesn’t suit them. To prevent this from happening to you, recognize one or two of your personal fascination advantages to discover the work that fascinates you and matches your personality. As we’ve already seen, we’re much more likely to excel at a job that fascinates us. In addition, being aware of other people’s fascination advantages and personal traits can help you set up productive teams. This way, you will know how each of your employees can contribute specific skills and strengths to a team. For example, one person might be more detail oriented and another more of a promoter; knowing their traits, you can position them so that they can both excel and achieve great things for you, too. The first fascination advantage is called the power advantage. People with this advantage are very confident and excel at convincing others of their opinion. They are willing to take calculated risks and won’t shy away from making difficult decisions. While the power advantage is helpful in many situations, it’s crucial to a role like that of a CEO, where difficult decisions and convincing others is part of the daily routine. Be careful, though: having too many people with a power advantage in one team can be disastrous, with every group discussion becoming a fight for control. But the power advantage is just the first of many. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at the next two fascination advantages. Do you know someone who’s always the life of the party? These are the kinds of people who exude charisma and have that magnetic personality that draws people to them. If so, chances are you know someone who has the passion advantage. People with the passion advantage are friendly, emotionally open and can connect quickly with other people. Since they tend have high levels of energy, they’re often enthusiastic about ideas or projects, and their enthusiasm can be contagious. In addition to having good social skills, they tend to rely on their intuition rather than on hard facts, and it usually works well for them. People who are high in passion are usually very good at giving presentations and forming relationships with customers. Though they can have difficulty hiding their emotions, their openness helps them communicate their message and persuade audiences. At the other end of the spectrum, people with the mystique advantage are level-headed observers who listen before they speak. Mystique personalities are often quiet intellectuals who like to think things through before they act. In contrast to passionate personalities, mystique individuals aren’t open with their emotions and you shouldn’t be surprised if they reject your idea of joining in a karaoke duet at an office party. These people have great time-managements skills and are very analytical. They like to make rational decisions and can excel at formulating business improvement strategies by studying performance data. Mystique personalities make great experts, and if you’re looking for someone to fill a scientific role, join the IT department or become a business analyst, look no further. So, passion is about people and mystique is about data. Next, we’ll investigate the main traits of perfectionists and project managers. When you finish a project, do you always feel you could have done better? Then you might fit the bill for the next advantage. The prestige advantage is all about striving for excellence and the desire for self-optimization. The most important motivation for people with this fascination advantage is to exceed expectations. Whether it’s a work project, running marathons or hosting a dinner party, being “good enough” is not an option; these competitive individuals will never settle for second-best. They’ll often have a business hero or public person that they admire and model themselves after to become better. When someone with a prestige advantage gives a presentation, it will usually involve the following: First, they will study a previous successful presentation, such as Steve Jobs’s presentation of the iPhone. Then, they will stand in front of a mirror and do a few training performances. Finally, after the presentation, they will conduct a self-evaluation, determine what went wrong and how they can improve. But when it comes to attention to detail, no one beats the people who have the alert advantage. The alert advantage involves careful precision and a passion for details, which makes these people the perfect project managers. They also like to stay on time, within the budget and have an eye for details that might otherwise fall through the cracks. As you might sense, this trait comes in handy for anyone involved in quality management. If someone you’re about to meet sends you a text to say that they’ll be five minutes late it’s a sign that they have the alert advantage. This is the kind of advantage you might also look for in a doctor, so they won’t miss any ominous signs during your next check-up. In Mesopotamia, somewhere around 3500 BC, someone came up with the brilliant idea of the very first wheel. While we don’t know anything about the inventor, it’s a safe bet that this person’s fascination advantage was the innovation advantage.  As the name suggests, the innovation advantage characterizes people who are always coming up with new ideas. These people are full of creativity and hold little regard for the status quo. Instead, they keep coming up with new ideas and ways to disrupt it. Just about any great scientific and technological breakthrough can be traced back to people with this advantage, be it that unknown Mesopotamian, Nikola Tesla or Steve Jobs. While other people are busy trying to improve an existing product, innovators will work on developing a new one from scratch. In leadership positions, these individuals tend to look at the big picture and excel at creating a vision for their team to fill with details. In this environment, they pair well with alert people, who would never miss a single detail that the innovator is after. But if you are looking for consistency and dependability, look to those with the trust advantage. It’s always nice if someone in your team has the trust advantage because they work hard and will commit to getting things done. If they are asked to perform a task, you can be certain that they will do it well. There are some tell-tale signs that suggest someone has a trust advantage. For instance, do you remember that classmate who always got straight As at school, even if they hated the subjects they were studying? They had the ability to keep their head down and work hard to finish whatever task was at hand. You can also be sure that a colleague has the trust advantage if he likes to stick to routines, shows up at the office at the same time every day and never misses a deadline. So don’t hold back any longer! Find your environment, discover your fascination advantage and be extraordinary. The key message in this book: There are seven fascination advantages, overarching personality traits people can use to help improve their performance and fascinate others. Everyone has one or two strong fascination advantages and identifying these traits will help you honor who you are and become more successful.  Actionable advice: Know about your dormant advantage. While reading these blinks, you might have realized that some fascination advantages describe you very well while others don’t describe you at all. These advantages are called dormant advantages and tasks that require you to exercise them are usually very exhausting. As a result, you might want to think about how you can change or even delegate these tasks. Remember, you don’t have to be good at everything. Got feedback?

He lives alone. In fact, you often see him wandering around the area by himself. Bizarrely, though, he seems to enjoy it. What a loser he must be! No “healthy” person could possibly enjoy so much solitude. Well, you’re wrong. Solitude is an immensely powerful and positive thing. Those of us who truly experience it, can be, in fact, far healthier and more relaxed than the rest of us. But this doesn’t mean that we should dump our friends and partners in favor of a lonely existence. There is a happy medium, as these blinks will explain. You’ll also discover how to ensure your children get enough time alone; why taking a bath is time well-spent; and why society dislikes a loner. Do you ever wish you had more time to yourself? These days, society puts a lot of pressure on us to stay socially active and focus on work, which means less time for ourselves. And yet, alone time can improve your personal well-being and creativity. That’s because, first of all, spending time alone allows you to discover your real “self.” When you’re alone, you can focus on a deeper understanding of who you are and what matters to you. Only by spending time alone, free of outside influences, can you discover these important parts of yourself. For example, the famous author Henry David Thoreau spent over two years alone in the woods of Walden Pond rediscovering himself. This time allowed him to assess his own values and those of the society around him. All of this led to Thoreau publishing his groundbreaking book Walden in 1854. With this kind of dedicated time alone, you can unlock and increase your creativity. In fact, many creative people in various fields have recognized solitude as a main source of creative output. The influential author Virginia Woolf believed that spending time alone was vital to creativity. In her 1929 book, A Room of One’s Own, she saw the lack of solitude as being linked to the relatively small number of female writers at the time. Woolf saw that females were not lacking talent, imagination or intelligence; they were lacking time alone to allow their creativity to blossom. The link between solitude and the happiness of creative freedom can be seen throughout history. Another example is the actress Greta Garbo. At the age of 35, after having appeared in 28 movies, Garbo decided to retire from acting and live a simple and solitary life. She continued to have an active social life, but by giving herself plenty of time alone, she was able to enjoy peace and creativity. So make sure you schedule yourself some alone time and reap the joys of solitude. Now that you recognize the benefits of spending some time alone, you might be wondering how you’re supposed to find this peaceful solitude. One of the best ways to find seclusion is to escape from the city and enter nature. By immersing yourself in nature, you can find a sense of connectedness to the world around you. But to achieve this, you should make sure you are completely alone as even bringing along your dog can be a distraction. When you’re completely alone, and you focus your attention on the natural environment around you, you’ll start to feel united with nature. This connection with nature is a beautiful and even mystical experience. Thoreau and others who have sought to escape the pressures of society through solitude have described it. People who have had this beautiful experience call it transcendence, or an interaction with something that goes beyond the conscious mind. Some have found spirituality in the transcendent experience; others have simply found joy and happiness. But, no matter what, solitude is a requirement in order to achieve a truly transcendent experience. For instance, whether someone in the Middle Ages was training to become a monk or a knight, both would spend time alone before their initiation into that profession. This period of solitude was called a vigil and was meant to prepare them for the next phase of their lives. To cite another example, in Australia, young Aborigines are sent on a walkabout: a six-month period of solitude meant to prepare them for adulthood. In many cultures throughout history, spending time alone has been considered necessary for the transition into adult society. So now that we’ve seen the many benefits to solitude, in the next blink we’ll find out why people who spend time alone are often described as selfish, unnatural – and sometimes even dangerous! Most people consider it socially acceptable when someone takes an occasional hiking trip on their own or secludes themselves for a brief period to work on a project. But when it comes to people who choose solitude as a way of life, they can often be looked down upon. This reaction is strange because modern society nurtures individualism. Today we can see many examples of people who are accepted for expressing their own individuality through bold fashion and lifestyle choices, tattoos or other body modifications. Yet, modern culture finds it threatening when people choose a lifestyle of solitude. If people support unique individuality, why is it considered suspicious for someone to choose being alone as a means of self-discovery? It looks like our evolution might be to blame. Philip Koch, a philosophy professor, researched the negative reactions to solitude – social anxiety and mistrust, to name a few – in his book Solitude. He found that, due to human evolution finding success through companionship, people have an inherent reaction to solitude as being unnatural. Others might consider seeking solitude as a pathological or harmful behavior. This is likely due to psychological research that has determined positive relationships with others to be necessary for an individual’s happiness. But if this research was true for everyone, then those who chose solitude wouldn’t find happiness. We also have a tendency to view someone who is isolated as putting themselves in danger. If they hurt themselves, who will be there to help them? Ultimately, these views are an unfair social stigma. If one desires the freedom of solitude, they should embrace it. After all, the problems of society don’t have to influence your own pursuit of happiness. If you want time alone, go for it! Perhaps you’re curious about living a life of solitude, or maybe you’ve recently lost a partner and have suddenly found yourself alone. Whatever the case may be, there are steps you can take to feel at ease on your own. First of all, it’s important to identify any fears you might have about being alone. Sometimes, if we tell ourselves we want time alone but never seem to find it, it might be due to a subconscious fear of being alone. This fear can even result in a negative reaction or anger toward a friend who is experiencing happiness through solitude. You can overcome these fears by simply giving yourself small doses of alone time that test your comfort levels. For example, rather than taking a shower, try taking a bath and allowing yourself to linger and focus on the fact that you are alone. You can even try to focus on being alone while you’re with others in a store or riding public transportation. While doing this, it’s important to realize that solitude isn’t dangerous or scary. History actually shows us that it’s healthy. Anthony the Great was the founding father of monastic living and remained in isolation for 20 years. When he came back to society, he was both mentally and physically fit. Impressed by his way of living, many people became his followers. The same can be said of the British-born Tibetan Buddhist nun Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo. Starting in 1976, she lived alone in a cave for 12 years during which time she remained healthy, and accepting and welcoming of others. So, once you overcome your fears, you can start looking for other ways to enjoy your solitude. Even if you’ve come to accept that there are many benefits to solitude, you might be doubting that you’ll find the time to fit it into your busy schedule. But there are some easy ways to squeeze more alone time into your life. One simple way is to spend more time focused on solitary activities you already enjoy. While many might consider reading, watching movies or listening to music as part of our important alone time, these are actually things that keep us from ourselves. These are vital activities and can be enriching, but it is important to consider the fact that, if you are concentrating on the writing or music of another person, then you aren’t truly spending time alone. A better solution is to take solitary walks in nature. These can be a great source of happiness for anyone and it doesn’t cost any money. Such walks are the perfect way to give yourself time to reflect, connect with nature and feel better about the idea of being alone. Likewise, running is a great way to get more in tune with your body, mind and nature. It’s a simple step to turn running into a meditative exercise that can lead to self-discovery and fulfillment. Once you feel ready for longer periods of solitude, it might be time to go on a “solo adventure.” For this you should choose a challenging but achievable trip that you can do on your own. For example, this could be a simple camping trip, a boating adventure or a visit to a foreign country by yourself. Ask yourself what you’d really enjoy and consider your realistic options. Whatever it ends up being, you’ll be spending valuable time with yourself by developing your sense of fulfillment and learning from your own experiences. Once you start expanding your periods of solitude, you might experience daydreaming. We’ll explore this sensation in the next blink. Do you ever think back to childhood and fondly remember keeping yourself entertained with just your imagination? As it turns out, the happiness we get from solitude can come from these experiences, which we tend to lose touch with as we get older. Psychologist Donald Winnicott has traced our adult ability to enjoy solitude back to when we were infants. During this time of early childhood, we could feel content to be alone after our basic needs, like being fed, were met by our parents. In these situations, we felt safe and secure, and free to wander around on our own and explore our surroundings. Unfortunately, as we grow older we no longer have the security and freedom of such moments. Often, once we enter the world of schools and social pressures, we can lose the sense of safe alone time and our ability to happily experience solitude. But it doesn’t have to stay this way. We can get our safe alone time back by learning how to engage with our active imagination and daydreaming. Active imagination, or reverie, is what psychoanalyst Carl Jung used to examine his subconscious. He would spend time alone daydreaming, recalling memories and dreams and taking notes to record his reactions. By writing it down in a notebook, he could figure out which thoughts and memories made him happy and, as it turned out, much of it was related to childhood solitude. Jung encouraged this reverie in his patients. He suggested they embrace solitude, return to thoughts of joy and happiness and reclaim the kind of safe alone time they experienced when they were children. While we can’t change our own childhood, we can foster solitude later on in life and pass on the benefits of safe alone time to others. Even though many of us hold on to meaningful childhood memories of solitude, few of us realize the importance of passing this along to our own children. Because, in today’s society, it’s more common for parents to teach their children about the dangers of being alone. Kids are thus denied the chance to learn the important benefits of solitude. We should, however, be more concerned about creating a safe environment for children to spend time in on their own. Childhood experts Anthony Storr and Richard Louv offer advice on how you can create such an environment. Even infants can use their active imagination: you don’t have to constantly engage with them. Even when they’re in your arms, they can let their eyes wander and explore their surroundings. This allows them to be on their own in a safe environment. Give toddlers alone time: give them space outdoors in parks or even in the woods where they can explore independently under your supervision. You’ll be surprised to see how creative and peaceful they can be in these environments. When it comes to story time, don’t be overprotective. Let kids enjoy stories where children encounter danger by themselves. Many parents try to protect their kids from stories that might be too frightening, but kids actually enjoy being a little scared. Many fairy tales, like The Snow Queen, have been passed down for many generations and contain tales of young boys or girls battling evil on their own. These stories are important for teaching children that, even if they are alone, they still have the strength to overcome challenges. But remember, since everyone is different, the amount of solitude a person needs differs from one person to another. You might think that the amount of alone time a person needs comes down to one simple question: Is she an introvert - someone who is shy, or an extrovert - someone who is socially outgoing? But it’s not that simple. First of all, the division between extroverts and introverts is nearly impossible to test given that most people will respond differently depending on the context. Let’s say you ask someone if she likes going to parties, thinking the answer will tell you if she’s an introvert or extrovert. The rational response would be that it depends on what kind of party it is and who else will be there. Another important thing to consider is that these categories are culturally biased. For example, introversion is appreciated in Japanese culture, whereas extroversion is highly valued in the United States. Therefore, if you were to ask someone from each of those countries the same personality questions, you’d get two different sets of answers based on the kind of behavior that’s considered socially acceptable. There’s a wide range of traits that make each of us different and unique – not just two categories. The same goes for the amount of solitude that’s right for us. There isn’t any psychological theory behind it: you simply have choose what works for you. Our society values individualism and unique differences, and the same should apply to your solitude. You wouldn’t want anyone telling you what to wear, and you shouldn’t let anyone tell you exactly how much time alone you should enjoy. It’s only natural that people in different parts of society are going to need more or less time alone. The more you learn and discover about yourself, the easier it’ll be to decide how much time you need. Whatever the case may be, we should respect one another’s decisions and not interfere when it comes to spending time alone. The key message in this book: In a society that values freedom and individualism, you should not be afraid to execute your right to solitude. There are numerous benefits and joys of solitude. Discover who you are, connect with mother nature and enhance your creativity by simply being alone.  Actionable advice: Start small and simple. When you’re tempted to find some time alone but unsure where to start, think about expanding something you already like to do, like a bike ride or a visit to your local café. Then think about making this activity 15 to 30 minutes longer while focusing on your individual experience. You might be surrounded by people but you’ll be at peace with your solitude. Got feedback?

Well, now you can learn all the tricks of the trade from the YouTube sensation Lilly Singh, who’s here to teach you how to become a bawse. By following her tips and advice, you’ll learn how to excel in any area of life – not only on YouTube. She lets you in on the ideologies and actions underpinning true success, so you have the tools necessary to stop dreaming and start becoming who you want to be. In these blinks, you’ll learn what a vision board is and how it can be useful; why being the dumbest person in the room is a good thing; and that, occasionally, you need to break the rules. Your mind can be both a delightful asset and a difficult obstacle. Sometimes it generates brilliant ideas, but it may just as often hold you back, refusing to let go of old ways of thinking. Clearly, you want your mind to work for you, and that means you need to befriend it. And the best way to make your brain into your buddy is to develop self-awareness. The first step toward self-awareness is recognizing the intricate layers of your inner issues. Each issue has at least three layers that need to be peeled back before you can reach the root cause. To explain this strategy further, let’s take a look at an issue the author is dealing with: she tends to act like she isn’t currently interested in having a romantic partner. At the first layer, she tells people that she’s too busy with work and building her career. At the second, she tells herself that the commitment of a relationship would impede her progress toward her goals. At layer three is yet another reason for her not wanting a relationship: she doesn't know how to balance her career aspirations and a healthy partnership. But, at the fourth and deepest level, she avoids relationships because of her childhood experience. She was never exposed to healthy relationships, and this resulted in her believing that they only bring out people’s ugly side. If you want to resolve a personal issue, you must first dig beneath these layers and identify its exact root cause, all while being completely honest with yourself. Only then can you start investing time and effort into resolving it. The second step toward self-awareness is conquering the thoughts and emotions that negatively impact you. Understanding why you feel certain emotions at particular times is important because it will put you in control of your feelings. Here are some pointers on managing typical thoughts and emotions: First, when someone brings out a negative reaction in you, try not to take it personally. In all likelihood, there are issues in that person’s life – issues that have nothing to do with you – that are influencing his or her behavior toward you. Second, remember that happiness is a better motivator than fear. And, thus, you should work toward something that makes you happy. Identifying the root cause of your issue, and managing negative thoughts and emotions, are the two key steps in developing self-awareness. If you want to be physically stronger, you head to the gym and hop on the elliptical or do a few reps on the bench press. Likewise, in order to strengthen your mind, you’ve got to train your brain – and the brain, like the body, has different sets of muscles. Here are three methods for exercising one of those muscles, your self-control muscle. First, you need to set goals for yourself. For example, set the goal of finishing a task in a certain amount of time. Once you’ve reached that goal, try to beat it. Second, remember to reward yourself every time you reach your goal. You can try asking a friend to hold your phone hostage, and tell them not to give it back until you’ve finished the task you’re working on – so getting your phone back is like a reward. The third method is challenging yourself to break a bad habit. If you’re a nail-biter, try to abstain from that habit for 24 hours, resetting the clock every time you gnaw your nails before that time is up. As important as it is to practice self-control, it is just as important to train yourself to hit pause. Every now and then, you’ve got to give your mental muscles a moment to recover. The author learned firsthand that taking a break was the only way to keep up with a hectic schedule. Once, when at a celebrity retreat in Italy, she got so burnt out that during a face-to-face meeting with the musician and artist Pharrell Williams all she could think about was sleep! Clearly, you don’t want to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity due to sheer exhaustion. So how can you stay sharp? The answer is meditation. This doesn’t mean you have to arise at daybreak or hire a guru. Meditation is flexible, and there are many different versions of it. So pick the practice that’s best for you. For the author, the suitable meditative practice is sitting on the ground, cross-legged, in front of a candle. With her eyes shut, she does some deep breathing while smiling. Finally, she whispers to herself whatever’s on her mind, and this process helps her unravel her thoughts and relax. With plenty of practice, you’ll have a powerful mind in no time! What do distraction and fear have in common? Here’s what: they’re the two biggest obstacles on your path to success. To accomplish anything great, you need to fully commit, and that requires learning how to control any fears and distractions that may get in your way. The author has faced her share of fear and distractions, but she didn’t let them throw her off course or diminish her commitment. As an example, let’s take her video shoot with Seth Rogen and James Franco. When the two actors arrived on set, she was initially distracted by her own nervousness. And then, when it was time to give her creative pitch, she was overcome with fear that they wouldn’t find her idea humorous. But instead of letting it completely derail her, the author kept her cool and pushed through, and she managed to finish the shoot in 45 minutes. How exactly did the author manage this kind of commitment? Well, she learned how to cast aside her fears in critical moments. She imagines her fears as a jacket that she can take off when she needs to. Along with full commitment, another thing you’ll need on your path to success is a vision. A useful way to manifest your vision is to make a collage that illustrates your goal. After you’ve created this collage of images – let’s call it a vision board – place it somewhere you can see it, and it will serve as a regular reminder of your goals and lead you to act in a more goal-oriented way. Your vision board is your brainchild, and you should protect it as if it were your real child. In other words, don’t hesitate to make necessary sacrifices to keep your vision board safe, and discard plans that require replacing it. You need to focus all your energy on your brainchild. For the author, this meant focusing all her energy on becoming a famous YouTube personality. Work out what your dreams are, and don’t hold back on making them come true. Imagine your personal and professional growth as a growing empire. And remember: an empire without a strong foundation will inevitably fall. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and it’s foundation probably wasn’t, either – so, when building your own foundation for success, be prepared for it to take a while. There’s no quick way to the top. Doing something outrageous or dangerous may make your YouTube video go viral, but that notoriety will vanish just as quickly as it appeared. In contrast, if you build your YouTube subscriber base over time, through hard, honest work, you’ll create a loyal following. To succeed, you’ll also need to establish a foundation of knowledge, tools and personal skills. That means investing time, effort and money in yourself. As her success grew, the author invested money in a support team, starting with a manager – and this foresight paid off, enabling her to make more videos, land more brand deals and increase revenue. Not only is having a strong foundation necessary for success, but it also frees you from stressful must-win situations. Once you have a foundational track record of success, no single accomplishment, and no single failure, will make or break your career. This decreases stress – a known performance inhibitor – and makes it easier to relax and focus on performing at your optimal level. Stress can definitely inhibit performance, but that doesn’t mean you should avoid it entirely, since people with stress-free lives are much likelier to procrastinate. The best way to make your life just stressful enough is to set deadlines for yourself. We all know that procrastination is detrimental to productivity, and yet many of us still tend to postpone things until the eleventh hour. This is where deadlines can save the day. To illustrate the importance of deadlines, let’s take a look at one of the author’s dreams. She wants to be an actress. The author knew that the best way for her to achieve this goal was to be in Los Angeles, so she set herself a deadline: move there by December 1, 2015. This self-imposed deadline propelled her into action and she made the move. Success isn’t going to happen overnight, so start setting deadlines and buckle up for the long haul. Like inspiration, validation is something we all desire – and that means it can be very good at motivating us. However, getting too much validation often spells doom for ambition. It feels great to have someone validate you. Having your peers, family members or coworkers tell you how great you are is sure to put you in a good mood. But here’s the problem: an overabundance of validation in your life can result in your no longer feeling motivated to seek additional validation. This is a problem because the desire for validation is often what drives people to work hard and strive toward their dreams. So, whenever you can, dismiss validation that’s unwarranted or offered too often, since it may make you complacent and unmotivated. In the author’s case, she attributes some of her success to how her mother handled validation. Her mother offers validation very sparingly. For example, when the author signs a huge new deal, her mother simply says, “That’s really good.” Furthermore, to be successful, you need to hang out with smarter and more experienced people than you. This may require leaving your comfort zone and seeking out people who you feel are more experienced, talented and knowledgeable than you. What you’re looking for are people who can challenge, intimidate and teach you, because these are the people you’ll learn the most from. You will have to leave behind your ego and accept that you’re not the best, and instead focus on gathering knowledge from others. Just ask Snoop Dogg and he’ll tell you the importance of surrounding yourself with great people. The rapper credits his long-standing career to being the dumbest person on his team. So if you want to enjoy success like Snoop Dogg’s, make it your goal to be the “dumbest” person in the group. How can you differentiate yourself from the throngs of other success-hungry people? Well, to stand out, you need to break the rules for the right reasons. This was exactly what the author did in order to meet her childhood hero, the actor and wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Having learned that it’s considered inappropriate in Hollywood for celebrities to directly message each other to meet up, the author knew she couldn’t grab a coffee with The Rock by simply sending him a text. And, as hard as she tried, neither she nor her team was able to make the arrangement. So she eventually decided to text him, Hollywood taboo be darned. And to her surprise, he replied to her message and they met up the very next day. Another way to stand out is to be fully present. This time the author was in an interview with a YouTube-channel management company. The CEO kicked off the interview by asking what he could tell her about the company. Instead of replying, she turned the question around with a smile and asked what they could do for her. This bold statement set the tone of the rest of the interview. When the CEO asked her what her goal is, she responded, “World domination,” followed by a pause and then a detailed version of her aspirations. Later that day, she got an email from the company, informing her that the CEO claimed, “She’s an absolute star,” and that she had completely won him over. To successfully embody a powerful presence that leaves an impression, like her performance at the interview, the author uses the following tools: first, she focuses on the situation at hand, taking in the room’s energy, and turning off her phone. Second, she focuses on being her genuine self. This means that she smiles when there’s a reason, such as when hearing a person’s name for the first time, and not simply to be pleasant and likeable. Working on your presence and breaking the rules when necessary will help you stand head and shoulders above the rest of the competition. What happens when you consume unhealthy foods? Well, you compromise your body. Similarly, when you consume negative thoughts, you compromise your mind. Thankfully, positive thinking is a skill we can develop. People talk negatively about others because it’s a quick-and-easy way to temporarily feel superior. However, this negativity comes at a price. First, such talk is a waste of precious time, since negative conversations tend to be protracted and repetitive. Negative talk also prevents you from noticing or appreciating other people, which in turn will prevent you from learning and embodying the positive traits of others. To train yourself in positive thinking, there are only two steps you need to follow. The first is to practice stopping yourself from saying negative things. Take the bad thought and pretend it’s your personal secret. Wait until you’re alone and then whisper it to yourself. The second step involves preventing negative thoughts altogether. You can practice this step when you meet a new person. Right away, pick out one admirable trait, such as that person’s calm personality. Then remember this characteristic as that person’s identifying feature. Over time, this process will train your mind to seek out only the positive aspects. In addition to thinking positively, having clear values will be useful on your path to success. By “clear values,” the author doesn’t mean a jumble of vague notions you sort of believe in; she means actionable moral guidelines that you can list in a personal manifesto. So simply jot down the list of values you want to live by, and add to it whenever a new one arises. An example of a value could be refraining from joining in on gossip. In order to put your value system into action, you need to learn it by heart. This means reading your list once a week, and reciting your values to yourself daily. Clear values are the foundation for a meaningful life, so grab a pen and paper and write that manifesto! Does being nice and working hard pay off? Or is the saying true, and nice guys really do finish last? Well, what the author can say about kindness is that it creates opportunities. An example of this is when the author saw Justin Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun, at a YouTube party. Being an admirer of his, she wanted to greet him, but didn’t know what to say. Eventually, she decided to approach him and simply say, “Hey! I think you’re really awesome and here’s why…” Braun, who just so happened to be going through a tough day, was really appreciative of the author’s kindness. The next day, he posted an Instagram picture of their meeting to express his gratitude, and has since supported her career by re-posting her videos. So being nice can pay off, but you need to be proactive about it. Niceness means a lot of things – smiling, behaving politely, being patient and leaving the last piece of cake. But if you want to be kind like a bawse, you need to be proactive, which means actively thinking up and behaving in ways that will make an impression. To do this, you need to make “being nice” a daily task on your to-do list. For instance, the author makes sure that she talks to everyone when shooting a video. After the shoot, she creates an email thread, thanking everyone who worked on the set. This action has earned her a reputation for pleasantness. Finally, if you want to generate change, you need to promote what you love. Bashing on what you hate doesn’t create a lasting effect. To create real, long-lasting change, you need to find solutions instead. To do this, the author focuses on promoting what she loves. When a reporter asked her opinion about drama involving Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, she replied that she respects both women for being strong and inspirational figures for young girls. After all, that’s what’s important, not the drama or whatever tiff they got into. By promoting strong and inspirational women as one of her values, the author established herself as a respectable bawse herself. The key message in this book: Becoming a successful and confidence-exuding bawse requires a strong foundation of hard work, discipline and values. With time, you’ll be able to train your mind to function effortlessly in this success-optimizing way. Actionable advice: Align your mind, body and soul. Your mind, body and soul are all players on your team. All three need to be in sync for you to be and function at your best. To determine whether you’ve lost synchronicity, ask yourself, are there things you constantly feel guilty about? Or do you fail to do things you say you’re going to do? If so, then you need to take a moment and realign your team and make sure that your thoughts, actions and emotions are working in harmony. Got feedback?

This might seem innocuous enough, but the truth is, all that time spent staring at a screen is not healthy. It’s not just that constantly using a smartphone will prevent you from being aware of what’s happening around you. More seriously, these phones are addictive because they’re designed to be that way. Using them for a little bit is fine, but letting your phone usage snowball can become problematic. These blinks will show you the basic psychology and science behind phone addiction. Using that knowledge, you’ll learn how to build a better and healthier relationship with your phone – and with technology more generally. This is not a diatribe, but a practical guide that will give you some common sense tips on how best to break up with your phone. What’s more, once you’ve made that decision, you’ll be shown how to get the most out of all that free time you’ll find yourself with. In these blinks you’ll learn: how hunter-gatherer living shaped modern phone habits; the relationship between getting distracted and poor memory; and what hormone regulates sleep cycles. Just take a look around you. On public transport, in restaurants, on street corners, whichever way you look today you’ll most likely see people – including children – glued to their phones. And the evidence is not just anecdotal. The data is clear. According to a 2016 Deloitte survey conducted in the United States, the average American checks his or her phone an average of 47 times each day. In the 18 to 24 age bracket, this number shoots up to a whopping 82 times per day. What that means, in terms of time, was clarified by research published in 2015 on hackernoon.com. Americans spend an average of four hours a day with their phones. That’s 28 hours per week, basically the same as having a fairly busy part-time job! So how do you know if you’re addicted? Thankfully, there’s a straightforward test you can take. It’s called the Smartphone Compulsion Test. It can be found online, and was designed by the University of Connecticut’s Dr. David Greenfield. Some of the key questions include: Do you occasionally spend more time with your phone than intended? Do you scroll without any sense of direction? Do you find yourself communicating more with people via your phone, rather than in real life? Do you keep your phone switched on in bed? Do you tend to stop what you’re doing so you can respond to something on your phone? If you find yourself answering yes to questions like these, then chances are you’ve got an addictive relationship with your phone. But don’t panic – you are not alone. Let’s begin by looking at why checking your phone really is a form of addiction, and what it means for you. If there’s one type of scientific experiment ever-present in the popular imagination, then it’s the ones in which rats have their behavior manipulated in some way. Traditionally, the rats are given food or electric shocks to encourage, or discourage, certain behaviors and tendencies. Such experiments rely on the presence of a certain hormone in the brain called dopamine. And you guessed it, humans react to it to. But how does it work? Well, when dopamine is released, it attaches to pleasure receptors in the brain and we experience pleasure. If a specific activity consistently causes dopamine to be released in the brain, we start to connect that activity with the dopamine release, and will engage in it more often. This dopamine hit served a useful function when humans were hunter-gatherers. It motivated us to forage and hunt, again and again; eating was a reward that produced a fresh release of dopamine. The downside to dopamine, though, is clear: it can also generate undesirable addictions and cravings. Those who know the science can use dopamine for their own purposes. Just look how social media is designed. Take Ramsay Brown, the founder of the start-up Dopamine Labs, which creates algorithms for social media apps. Each algorithm is designed to trigger a dopamine release in the brains of individual users. That way, they’ll keep using their phones and continue interacting with the app in question for longer periods of time. For example, an algorithm stores “Likes” or messages from other users, but it doesn’t release them to the user in real time. Instead, the algorithm takes note of the user’s app interaction patterns, and knows when the user is likely to shift to doing something else. At that precise moment, the app releases its stored Likes and messages. This user feedback results in the release of dopamine in the user’s brain. This, in turn, keeps them in the app environment. The user becomes hooked. Distraction is commonly thought of as something negative. But in reality, distraction is an entirely natural phenomenon. In fact, distraction was key to survival in early human history. Back then, we had to be highly attuned to our surroundings. After all, a predator could be lurking in the undergrowth, and so we needed to be ready to run. However, that’s not the whole truth. Our inclination to being distracted also comes down to neurobiology. For starters, the act of concentrating is hard work for the brain. There are two reasons for this. First off, the brain has to decide what to focus on. It’s a complex task performed by the prefrontal cortex. And the prefrontal cortex tends to get fatigued pretty quickly – you can think of it as a large muscle. If it has to make too many consecutive decisions, it becomes overwhelmed. Distraction soon sets in, as we find ourselves unsure of what to concentrate on. Second, sustained concentration takes effort. The brain must shut off all unnecessary internal and external inputs. Additional sensory information and distracting thought processes must not be allowed to interfere and compete for attention. Although we’re not aware of this occurring, it takes our brains a lot of effort to sustain high levels of concentration. So what about phones? Well, as it turns out, they are great at distracting the brain. Let’s compare them to books to get an idea of why. When you’re reading a book, distractions only come from the outside world. Perhaps there’s a knock at the door, or you get a phone call. It’s pretty clear for the brain what it should devote its attention to. But with phones, it’s different. Ads, links and pop-ups appear on-screen, right where we’re trying to concentrate. Simply put, the brain has to go to a lot more effort to maintain focus. It gets drained sooner, and maintaining attention becomes more difficult. The result is that it succumbs to distractions more quickly. Before we know it, we’re surfing the web or checking emails, rather than doing what we intended. There’s a lesson we can learn from this. If you’ve got a text to read, you’re better off reading a hard copy or an ad-free e-book than attempting to do it on your phone. Memory makes us who we are. That’s why the onset of illnesses like Alzheimer’s among older people is so feared. But issues with memory affect younger generations too. Just think of how difficult it can be as a student to memorize facts and figures for tests. It won’t come as a surprise to learn that phones are a contributing cause of this. Phones can do real damage to your short-term memory. Your short-term memory – or working memory – is the part of your brain that tracks what’s going on in the present moment, juggling all the bits of information that you need to process. For instance, it stops you from forgetting that you’re looking for your keys while you’re looking for your keys. But short-term memory can only keep track of a small number of things at any one time. In fact, in a study from 1956, psychologist George A. Miller found that can only hold around seven items simultaneously. Recently, science author Nicholas Carr scaled that down to a more realistic two to four items. Phones can interfere with your short-term memory through constant distraction. Every time you glance at your phone, your short-term memory is prevented from retaining information about what’s going on in the real world. After all, the working memory can only keep track of a few things simultaneously. Good luck remembering who you’ve just met at a dinner party if you’re receiving a stream of notifications via social media. And it’s not just your working memory that suffers. Phones also damage long-term memory. Your long-term memory’s function is to retain information about what happened last week, last year or a long time ago. But here’s the rub. Data like that starts its journey in the short-term memory, and is then stored in long-term memory. What’s more, only some of the information ends up getting transferred from one to the other. That’s because the transferal process takes up a huge amount of energy. The result is that when the short-term memory receives too much distracting input from a phone, the whole process breaks down. Information does not get relocated to the long-term memory. And your phone is to blame. Social media is one of the great innovations of the digital age. There are many practical benefits to its existence, but its effects on individuals’ emotional states can be tremendous. It is not unusual to be flung between feeling happy, anxious, interested, disgusted and lonely within just a few minutes on social media. Needless to say, all that turbulence wreaks havoc on rest and relaxation. Most noticeably, phones disturb your ability to fall asleep. This is due to the fact that phones are designed to be highly stimulating and to grab your attention. Trying to fall asleep with your phone nearby is much like trying to doze off on the living room sofa – with the TV blaring or your friends having a heated political discussion. It’s these conditions that you take to bed with you if that’s where your phone is. Furthermore, the blue light given off by phone screens can also cause problems. This part of the color spectrum tricks your brain into thinking that it’s still daytime. So if you’re replying to a late-night text, you’re going to find it harder to fall asleep. There is a science to sleep. When the brain no longer detects blue light, it starts producing the sleep regulatory hormone melatonin. And it’s melatonin that gets your body ready for sleep. All this means that if you look at your phone too late in the evening, getting to sleep will become more difficult. But that’s only the first step to poorer health. Sleep disruption, as caused by phones, can lead to chronic fatigue. And chronic fatigue, in turn, may result in more severe illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease. According to a 2008 Harvard Medical School study, even low-levels of sleep deprivation may adversely affect mood, decision-making and learning ability. What’s more, according to the same study, the onset of symptoms can arrive fast. Normally you need seven to eight hours of sleep a night. But all it takes is a stretch of ten days with six hours of sleep per night for damage to be done. Your alertness will be as poor as if you’d gone 24 hours without any sleep at all. The lesson is clear. Not only do you not need your phone in bed, you should try to avoid it in the hours before going to bed as well. Let’s be clear. Deciding you want to spend a little less time with your phone is not about making a moral judgment. There’s no need to fundamentally change your view on your phone. However, a trial run breakup is a good place to start. It will help you decide whether your phone habits are unhealthy, and how you can improve your interactions with your phone. There’s no need to panic. You can have a little break from your phone, and you’ll always be able to go back to your old habits if it’s not for you. If you do decide to reduce your phone usage, you’ve got to be crystal clear with yourself as to why you’re doing it. In other words: What is your motivation? It’s not enough just having a hazy notion that less time spent on your phone would be good. You have to be prepared. After all, you wouldn’t leave your partner for someone else just because you have some ill-defined idea of a better relationship. No – you should be certain about what would be different in this new relationship. Find your motivation. Breaking up with your phone could, for instance, give you the opportunity to learn a new language, or to spend quality time with loved ones. The other element to breaking up with your phone involves being aware of your own behavior. Try to work out exactly how much time you spend on your device every day. Don’t worry – you don’t have to carry around a stopwatch. Tracking apps like Moment or Offtime can record how often you look at your phone, and the amount of time you spend on your phone each day. The process of working out your phone habits will mean that you’ll be in a much better position to set a realistic target. If you know how long you’re on your phone, then you know how much time you’ll be able to save, and what activities you could use that time for instead. Without a doubt, some of the most addictive elements on your phone are social media apps. Much like junk food, it’s hard to stop consuming social media once you’ve started. But deleting them really isn’t that hard to do. Simply delete the app from your phone. Certainly, some message will pop up to ask questions and cast doubt on your intentions. Perhaps it’ll warn you that data will be permanently deleted. Just ignore it. In the digital age, that data can be recovered. It’ll be sitting in the internet cloud, ready to be downloaded to your phone if you ever come back. Still unsure? Just think of all the real-life experiences you could have, instead of messing around on an app. Maybe focus on one that’s brought you a lot of joy, like an excursion in nature or a house party. Think hard, which kind of experiences do you value more? The shadow world of social media, or human connections in the real world? Asking yourself this, and articulating your wants, will ensure that you can delete those apps and move on. If you’re worried that deleting your social media apps might be too big of a step, there’s really no cause for concern. This decision is not final, and you can always return after a few weeks or months. There’s nothing stopping you. Of course, remember that you’re not actually deleting your accounts; all social media is still accessible from your computer. The key word here is accessibility – you can now start to interact with social media when you consciously wish to do so. And the same lessons we learned about phone usage can be applied to your computer habits. Only open your internet browser when you have something specific to do. Even then, limit your activity to a set time. One of the classic symptoms of breaking up with your phone is called “Fear of Missing Out,” or FOMO for short. In order to avoid FOMO, it’s very important to know what you’re going to fill your time with in advance of your breakup. Otherwise you’ll just reach for your phone when you get bored. Begin by recalling what you enjoy when you’re disconnected from the world. Make some lists, trying not to feel limited by the recent past. Perhaps there were activities you loved doing as a kid, or maybe there are things that have always fascinated you, but that you never had time to pursue? And of course, there are bound to be people that you’d like to spend more time with. Once you’ve jotted down your ideas, the next step is to create a more concrete plan. Make a schedule that fits with your routine. Remember that you don’t have to do everything at once – pacing things out will work wonders. Imagine you’ve decided on a two-week breakup with your phone. Some of the things you could do might include solving a crossword puzzle, going on a nature excursion, taking a drawing class, organizing a board games party, visiting a local museum, meeting friends or experimenting with a new recipe. But there’s one activity that trumps all others, and it’s the most basic one to human existence. Use your newfound time to exercise. We live in an industrialized, digital age. That means that we can end up feeling quite disconnected and alienated from our bodies. Phones don’t help in the slightest here: overuse your phone, and your body will start to feel like an unnecessary appendage. Needless to say, it’s also far healthier to exercise than it is to use your phone. There are all kinds of exercises that can help you explore and reconnect with your body. They could range from something as simple as a walk or doing a bit of relaxed yoga, right through to dance classes. Exercise with friends can also be fun, and there are even some video games that require vigorous effort. So, no more excuses.  After all, even if you do go back to using your phone more regularly, there’s every chance your life will have been enriched in the meantime. Who can really turn their nose up at reconnecting with friends, getting back into hobbies or learning new skills? So far we’ve got to grips with the issues involved with phone usage, and how you can benefit from a break. But abstract reasoning will only get you so far. You have to break habits, and that challenge should not be underestimated. So in this and the next blink we’ll look at a 30-day plan that’ll help you unplug from your phone. Let’s get started. Over the first two days you should use an app to track how often you’re on your phone. You’ll probably find it’s more often than you think. This step, therefore, is all about increasing your awareness. On days 3 and 4, you should pay close attention to your feelings before, during, and after using your phone. You should also pay close attention to how often you interrupt a given activity to check your phone. In particular, consider whether you feel better after working on a task without interruptions. During this time, you may notice that your brain craves the dopamine reward triggered by checking your phone. Equally, try to detect the disappointment of distraction, of realizing that there is nothing new or noteworthy when you look at your phone. On days 5, 6 and 7 you should refrain from using social media apps. As we discussed earlier, put that free time to active use for things you love. Exercise, podcasts, or picnic – anything you like doing. On day 8 disable all notifications. Remember that all those pings and vibration alerts have been designed as cues to get you back on your phone. Days 8 and 9 are also the time to prune down your apps. Only keep essential ones, such as apps for banking or maps. Everything else should be deleted. Social media, gaming or dating apps are all no-gos. Now, all that freed-up mental energy and time you used to spend on these apps can instead be used for productive tasks. On day 10, set up a charging station that’s not in your bedroom. That way you won’t be compelled to use your phone before sleep and then again the moment you wake up. Prepare yourself for days 10, 11 and 12 by getting some interesting books, setting up a meditation corner, or simply thinking of any other meaningful activity that doesn’t involve your phone. On days 13 and 14, you should establish phone-free zones around your apartment. The dining table is a good place to start. You can also sketch out phone free time periods. Do you really need it after 6 p.m., for instance? Doing that will also stop you phubbing. That’s the “phone snubbing” that occurs when you check a message or a notification, ignoring everyone actually around you in real life. Great! You’re halfway through the 30-day program. Let’s take the last steps in the last blink. The first two weeks of the 30-day plan were all about the phone. Weeks three and four are about you. On days 15 and 16 you should try to practice some basic mindfulness. Whenever you find yourself reaching for your phone, tell yourself to stop, breathe and just be. Listen to your breath. Then ask yourself whether looking at your phone is really that important. This process will strengthen your behavioral awareness and give you a simple tool to stop you unnecessarily checking your phone. On days 17 and 18, try some concentration exercises. This could be as simple as repeating the two times table as long as you can or listening to a piece of music with your full concentration. If you work on your ability to focus, you’ll improve your resistance to being distracted by your phone. Days 19 and 20 are big ones. They’re for your first trial separation. You need two full days for this, so it may be best to do it over a weekend. It’s simple. Just switch off your phone. That’s it. Be sure you keep a notebook on hand in case you need to jot anything down or look anything up later. This will help you resist reaching for your phone. On days 22 and 23, reflect on your two-day trial separation. You’ll be able to recognize and weigh up what you like about your phone, and, alternatively, what you like about phone-free time. On days 24, 25, and 26, clean up those last aspects of digital life that have been annoying you. For instance, if your email inbox is overflowing, unsubscribe from anything that’s no longer relevant. Next, create a new folder for emails that need a reply. That way, from now on, you’ll have a clear visualization of tasks that actually require your attention.   During days 27, 28, 29 and 30, keep on monitoring your phone behavior. Perhaps you’ll find that you’re checking your phone less frequently –  and possibly more consciously too. If you’re up for it, now’s the time for a second two-day trial separation. Just be sure that in this final stretch that you also plan for the future. Schedule a regular time each month for checking in on how your new phone rules are working. That way, you’ll be less likely to fall back into old habits. The key message in these blinks: More and more people the world over are becoming addicted to their phones. And it really is a form of addiction. Social media developers are partly to blame; they engineer apps around this principle. Addiction such as this can be detrimental to your attention span, memory and quality of sleep. Consequently, it’s well worth breaking up with your phone, or at the very least, reducing the time you spend on it. You’ll finally have the time for real-life experiences, and the space to get started on lifelong projects and dreams.  Actionable advice: Buy an alarm clock! One of the best indicators of phone addiction is the need to take your phone to bed. You think you’re just using it for the alarm, but more often than not you’re off using it within minutes of waking. There’s an easy way around this. Buy an old fashioned alarm clock that does nothing more than ring. You can leave your phone in another room and ensure a good night’s sleep, as well as a healthy start to the next morning.

Meeting someone new almost always entails meandering small talk, awkward silences and uncomfortable eye contact. And so most of us avoid the hassle and the horror of friend-making. We stick to our group of friends and steer clear of people we don’t know. Yet making new friends is incredibly beneficial. Not only will it expand your social circle; it will also help you develop your interpersonal skills – skills that can bring a host of benefits, both personal and professional. These blinks will teach you how to be instantly likable, and equip you with the tools to impress prospective friends in just a minute and a half. You’ll also discover how much you can learn about someone from their eye movements; why we like a person who leans forward; and why making new friends can help you live longer. Ever since first cohabitating on the plains of Africa, we Homo sapiens have understood the benefits of living in communities. Back then, early humans would come together to hunt and cook; they knew that, as a group, they stood a much better chance of surviving than they would if each individual had to fend for him- or herself. This profound desire to connect and bond with others is still with us. Whether it’s at cocktail parties, town-hall meetings or Star Trek conventions, we simply love the chance to meet and be around others. It’s a universal human trait. And, in addition to being written into our very nature, bonding with people is actually incredibly beneficial to our health and well-being. Those of us who are good at connecting with others stand a better chance of living a long life. One study by Dr. Lisa Berkman of the Harvard School of Health Sciences observed a group of 7,000 people over nine years. Her results showed that those who lacked quality social or community connections were three times more likely to die of a medical illness than those who had strong social ties. But a longer lifespan isn’t the only benefit of continuously making new friends. It’s also essential for success. Whatever we dream of in life, whether it’s a great job, a new partner or a ticket for that sold-out Broadway show, you’ll stand a much better chance of finding it if you have a wide social network to help you. You’ll hear about job openings from former colleagues; friends will set you up on blind dates; and, who knows, an acquaintance may well be selling exactly the ticket you’re looking to buy. Okay, so the benefits of bonding are clear. But that doesn’t mean connecting with others is easy.  In fact, it can be pretty hard to connect with new people, especially if you don’t have any shared interests. What’s more, whenever you meet someone, you only have around 90 seconds to make an impression. If you don’t spark the person’s interest in that time, it’s highly probable that you’ll never spark it. Luckily, it’s possible to kindle connection in under 90 seconds. In the following blinks, you’ll learn the essential skills and hacks that will enable you to do this. You now know that the first few moments you spend with a new person are crucial to forming a connection, but did you also know that people start forming a first impression of you before you even open your mouth? The first things a person will notice about you are your body, your eyes and the expression on your face, and it’s essential for all three of these elements to transmit a feeling of openness. Start with your body. To display openness to someone, you must position your body with your heart aimed directly toward them; this will communicate sincerity, full commitment to the conversation and a readiness to connect. Next, look directly into their eyes. Direct eye contact is a great way to establish trust, making it an essential element of any successful first encounter. Finally, be sure you’re the first one to smile. Let your positive attitude shine through your bright grin. The other person will subconsciously understand that you’re sincere and open. After you’ve set this warm and welcoming mood for the encounter, break the ice by introducing yourself. Don’t overthink it. Just offer a standard greeting like “hi” or “hello” in a pleasant tone. Then tell the person your first name and encourage them to introduce themselves as well. Once they do so, immediately repeat their name to ensure it sticks in your memory: “Brenda. Nice to meet you, Brenda!” Finally, lean slightly toward the other person to subtly indicate interest and openness. As you perform this slight lean in, you can either combine it with a firm and respectful handshake or use the hands-free technique in which you leave your hands by your sides. When it comes to establishing a natural rapport with someone, nothing beats talking about shared interests. For obvious reasons, you’re more likely to hit it off with someone who supports the same sports team or reads similar books. But what do you do when no such common ground exists? Well, in such cases you need to establish rapport by design. There are several ways to do this, which we’ll cover in the next couple of blinks, but the prerequisite for all of them is having the right attitude: you can either have a useful attitude or a useless attitude. A useful attitude means you’re focused on what you want out of the conversation, while a useless one is focused on what you don’t. If you display a useful attitude, you will automatically show the positive body language and facial expressions that will make you more likable. On the other hand, having a useless attitude will leave you with passive or negative body language that puts people off. So, if you want to improve your rapport with others, it’s best to adopt a useful attitude. But how exactly should you do this? A useful attitude begins with deciding what you want from each conversation. Therefore, when beginning a conversation, consider your end goal and the approach that will help you reach it efficiently. For instance, say you’re going home for the holidays, and your flight is cancelled. If you have a useless attitude, you’ll be focused on the fact that you don’t want to be stuck at the airport. This may lead to your shouting at the airline staff about how urgently you need a replacement flight. However, if you adopt a useful attitude, you’ll concentrate on your desire to find someone who can help you get another flight. All that screaming and shouting won’t get you the assistance you need, but being open and likeable to a member of the staff might. In short, by focusing on a desired positive outcome from the  conversation, you'll automatically adopt the body language and smile that will endear you to those who can actually help you get another flight. As you’ve learned, a useful attitude is the foundation for effective body language. But what exactly is effective body language? Generally speaking, body language can be divided into two categories: open and closed. Open body language exposes your heart and body, signaling to others that you are not only willing to communicate, but enthusiastic about it. As a result, when two people begin a conversation with their hearts facing one another, they form a powerful connection and mutual trust is likely to increase. On the other hand, closed body language protects the heart through gestures that express resistance, frustration, impatience and nervousness. Crossed arms are one of the most common instances of defensive body language, as crossing one’s arms protect the heart and therefore one’s feelings. Turning your body sideways relative to your conversation partner can also evoke a similar feeling. And body language isn’t just about your body. It’s also your facial expressions, which can be open or closed as well. For example, an open face smiles, makes eye contact and displays clear expressions such as raised eyebrows, while a closed face looks stern and avoids eye contact. Another key to ensuring that people like and trust you is displaying a consistent and congruous message across your whole body, as inconsistencies will bother people. According to former UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian, a prominent figure in the field of communication, credibility depends on the congruity of three communicative aspects: the vocal, the verbal and the visual. In other words, what you say, how you say it and the signals your body sends while you’re saying it all need to be aligned. If they’re not, the other person won’t feel you’re being honest, and both of you will feel unpleasant. Just think of a friend telling you that he’s “fine” while he looks away with crossed arms and taps his foot. It’s not hard to tell that he doesn’t seem fine, which robs his words of their credibility and creates awkwardness. Mimicking others is a fundamentally human trait. In fact, even if you don’t realize it, you’ve been synchronizing yourself with other people since the day you were born: a baby’s body rhythm is literally synchronized with that of its mother. And this tendency to synchronize continues later in life. For instance, an adult’s taste in clothes will often be influenced by that of his or her partner’s. But why does this happen? Does it mean everyone is just a copycat? Actually, it’s completely natural to adapt to others. For instance, when someone smiles at you, you immediately feel a desire to smile back. Similarly, when someone yawns, it makes you want to yawn. And if you’ve ever seen a boxer get punched in the stomach, you know that it makes you feel like wincing in pain, too. This synchronization is a major part of our lives and is especially important when it comes to building rapport. After all, we do seem to prefer people who are in synch with us. We typically feel best when in the company of people whose behavior is in sync with our own, and studies have shown that we even tend to hire and even date people that look like us. But what exactly is meant by synchronization when it comes to increasing your likeability? Specifically, it refers to discreetly copying and subtly imitating the gestures of your conversation partner, as well as their body posture, facial expressions, breathing and tone of voice. Synchronization is especially important for salespeople because a mismatch in communication styles can kill a sales pitch. Imagine a quiet man who’s respectfully and silently perusing an art gallery being accosted by an aggressive salesperson, who stands way too close to him, grabs his shoulder and gregariously praises the pictures. It’s safe to say the salesperson would be better off matching the patron’s own quiet demeanor and respectful manner. Synchronizing your voice with that of your conversation partner is also a particularly powerful tool, especially if your interlocutor speaks in a quiet voice and you tend to be louder. Simply lowering your own voice will help put your partner at ease; he’ll feel more comfortable speaking with someone who shares his same gentle tone. Up until this point, you’ve learned a lot about how to make someone feel comfortable in your presence through the right visual cues and intonation, but obviously the content of what you say is also vital to making a good impression. So how do you get a chat going in the right direction? Well, questions are perfect for starting conversations, and they come in two forms: those that open people up and those that close them down. Let’s start with open questions, which invite other people to talk. Say you’re at a restaurant and decide to strike up a light conversation with a stranger. You might say something like “What a lovely restaurant” and then ask, “Where do you think the chef is from?” The key is to use conversation-generating words like “Who,” “When,” “What,” “Where,” “How” and “Why” to request an explanation or opinion from your interlocutor. Closed questions, on the other hand, encourage a yes or no response and are formed with phrases like “Are you...,” “Have you...” and “Do you….” If you ask someone a closed question – for instance, “Do you come here often?” – you’ll be lucky to receive more than a simple affirmative or negative in return. So it’s best to stick with open questions to keep the conversation flowing. However, asking the right questions is only half the conversation game. The other half is active listening, meaning not just listening to the words coming out of the other person’s mouth, but paying attention to that person’s feelings and emotions as well. So how do you do this? Well, you’ve got to listen with much more than just your ears. Use ample eye contact (but don’t stare), listen with your body by facing your heart toward the speaker, lean in and nod your head when you agree with what is being said. And when you want to say something, remember, first, not to interrupt the other person and, second, to enthusiastically respond to what’s been said. For example, if your conversation partner says, “I really like living in Chicago, but my husband got a promotion and we might move to Miami,” you could say, “Wow, that seems like a huge and stressful decision. How are you going to decide where to live?” In 1970, Richard Bandler and John Grinder, the founders of the approach to communication known as neuro-linguistic programming, or NLP, realized that people perceive the world by filtering stimuli via one of three different senses: visual, auditory or kinesthetic. Naturally, all people use a mix of these three senses as they go about their life, but one always dominates, and knowing which is prevalent in your conversation partner can greatly affect your rapport. People who are predominantly visual care a lot about how things look. They generally tend to think in images, and they probably dress sharply and talk very fast. These people like to use expressions like “How do you see yourself? or “I see what you’re saying.” Auditory people love conversation, have fluid, melodic, expressive voices and enjoy the spoken word as well as sounds in general. As a result, they gravitate toward careers in broadcasting, teaching and the law. They tend to say things like, “Sounds familiar,” “Tell me more” and “I didn’t like the tone of his voice.” Finally, kinesthetic-focused people like solid things that they can feel. They have lower voices, like textured clothing and tend to speak very slowly. Often, they’ll use expressions like “How do you feel about . . . ?” and “I’ll get in touch with her.” By matching your responses to a person’s dominant sense, you can make that person like you more. For example, a visual person is more likely to like you if you speak as quickly as she does or if you dress nicely. Someone with an auditory focus will prefer it if you speak very clearly and use a pleasant tone of voice, and those with kinesthetic sensibilities will prefer it if you match their tone of voice and speak quietly and sensitively. So how can you tell which type of learner someone is? Just watch how they move their eyes. For instance, if you ask someone what he liked most about his vacation, a visual person will tend to look up to the left or right as if he’s seeing the answer, an auditory person will look left or right (toward his ears) and a kinesthetic person will look down to either side, toward his hands and body. In other words, if you’re unsure how best to communicate with someone, just look at their eyes. By doing so, you’ll learn which sense that person favors and will know how to adapt your conversational style accordingly. The key message in this book: Endearing yourself to a new acquaintance begins from the moment the two of you meet. The way another person feels around you in the first meeting is key to your likability, which is why it’s essential to adopt a genuinely open attitude and willingness to connect. But remember, speed is of the essence. If you don’t get someone to like you within the first 90 seconds, you’ll probably never click. Actionable advice: Control the tone of your voice with this simple exercise. Say you notice that your conversation partner speaks in a calm and relaxed tone, but you tend to talk a mile a minute. To bring yourself down to your interlocutor’s level, try some belly breathing: focus on breathing into your abdomen, rather than your chest. Pretty soon your breathing will slow down – and your speaking pace will, too. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Just finding the time to sift through all of the competing news and lifestyle sites can be a chore. And this is where theSkimm comes in to help you make sense of it all. Launched in 2012, by Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg, theSkimm set out to give young women a reliable source of meaningful information – the kind of news and insight people need in order to feel capable of making good decisions. This service has grown over the years and has resulted in How to Skimm Your Life, a collection of tips and information on the kinds of subjects that affect all of us in our day-to-day lives, from food and travel to finances and politics. It’s a complex world out there, and a lot of critical things, like knowing how to invest your money or how to pack properly for a trip, are never taught in school. So let’s skim through some of these things together and get up to speed. In these blinks, you’ll find four items every kitchen needs; ways to make air travel less of a hassle; and the steps needed to make your first investment. Does the following sound familiar? You’re standing in front of a wall of wine bottles, wondering what to bring to a party, and your mind is a total blank. Should I buy white, red, bubbly or a dessert wine? Will I look foolish if it doesn’t pair well with dinner? Wine should be enjoyed as a stress-reliever, not a stress-creator. So let’s look at some tips and essential info that will help you feel more comfortable the next time you find yourself chatting about wine with a friend. Wine is essentially fermented grape juice, and the color of the wine is determined by the color of the grape skins to which it is exposed after the juicing process. Likewise, the amount of tannin a wine has is determined by how long the wine spends soaking with grape skins, seeds and stems. Tannin is a compound with natural antioxidant properties, and is generally found more in red wines than in white; it’s the reason your mouth tends to feel dry after a glass of red. Now, when it comes to tasting wine, you may have noticed that people like to swirl the wine in their glasses and take some air into their mouths after taking a sip. This may come across as pretentious, but there’s a good reason for it: swirling the wine and taking in air are both ways of getting oxygen into the wine, which opens up more of the wine’s complex flavors. Of course, knowing why you’re doing it won’t change the fact that it still looks a bit goofy. There’s a whole list of words people use when talking about wine as well, such as crisp, bright and flat. A lot of these words refer to the amount of acidity in the wine, and speak to the amount of citrus flavor it has. A good amount of acidity can lead to a crisp and fresh-tasting wine; no acidity, and the wine can taste flat or even flabby. And if you hear someone say the wine tastes oaky, that’s a reference to the oak barrels in which the wine spent time. New barrels will impart an oakier flavor, while old barrels tend to impart more subtle ones. So whether you’re enjoying a Chardonnay with some chicken or pork, or a Zinfandel with your pizza, now you know what goes into your favorite wine to make it so distinctive. If you’d like to cook something to go with your favorite bottle of wine, here are a few things that every kitchen should have. First of all, make sure you have a ten-inch stainless steel skillet, which is good for frying, searing, making sauces and so much more. This pan is the all-round MVP of most kitchens, as is an eight-to ten-inch chef’s knife. Your kitchen should also have two cutting boards, with one set aside for just fruits and vegetables. They can be wood or plastic, but keep in mind that the wooden ones don’t dull your knives nearly as much as the plastic ones do. If you’re hoping to follow a recipe, you’ll want to have two sets of measuring cups – one for liquid ingredients and one for everything else. And finally, no kitchen is complete without a colander. Sure, they’re the best at draining pasta, but they’re also an ideal tool for helping you wash your fruit and veg. These days, when people are considering their diets, they may also be thinking about the environment, sustainability and how they can live more “green.” While the issue of climate change may be a hotly debated political topic, the reality is that around 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real and something we should act on. And there are some simple actions you can take around the house to reduce your impact on Mother Nature. For instance, buying energy-efficient light bulbs, programmable thermostats and “smart” power strips are all relatively easy ways of upping your eco-friendly game.  Smart power strips are helpful because when we turn off certain electronic devices like the TV or stereo, they often end up in a standby mode that still uses electricity. By plugging your appliances into smart power strips, you’ll be sure that off really means off – and you’ll save money on your electric bill. That’s a win for the planet and your pocketbook. Anyone can forget to turn off the heat on the way out the door, so programmable thermostats are great for reducing wasted energy. Drafty windows are a less-obvious source of such waste.  During the cold months, you can practice green living by making sure the areas around your doors and windows are sealed up. You can do this with V-seal weather strips, which you can stick around the edges of your windows. Do you love to travel, but hate dealing with airports? Then join the club! No, seriously! If you live in the United States, then by filling out the right paperwork and meeting the requirements, you can qualify for TSA PreCheck. This allows you to skip the dreadful security lines that are most travelers’ worst nightmare. The cost for a five-year TSA PreCheck membership is $85. But keep in mind that you’ll not only need to fill out the paperwork, you’ll also need to show up for an interview. These interviews usually take place at an airport, so if you’re a frequent flier, you may want to try to schedule your face-to-face for just before an upcoming flight – when you’re planning on being at the airport anyway! If you live in the United States but most of your traveling takes place outside the United States, you’ll want to consider Global Entry. This one costs $100 for a five-year membership, and it not only includes TSA PreCheck, it also allows you to skip the customs line that no one looks forward to when returning to the United States from abroad. Another way of making travel less of a hassle is to pack smart. One helpful tip from which everyone can benefit is to pack your clothes using the military roll technique. Basically, this means rolling your clothes up instead of folding them. You’ll be able to pack more into your luggage and you’ll find fewer wrinkles and creases when you take your clothes out of your suitcase. As for how you should pack a pair of shoes: by slipping a shower cap around them, you can put them in with the rest of your clothes and not worry about contamination! Making some small tweaks to your traveling can make a world of difference. Likewise, with some small tweaks you can seriously improve your networking skills as well. Cue spreadsheets. You don’t need to have advanced Excel skills in order to turn a spreadsheet into a valuable tool for networking. All you need to do is make a few columns for name, email, job title, date of last contact and a place for some useful notes.  By putting all your networking contacts into such a database, you’ll be able to keep track of who’s who and know exactly how much time has passed since you last touched base. Ideally, you should keep your contacts active by getting in touch at least once a quarter, and with your networking database you can make sure no one falls through the cracks. Bragging about yourself can be uncomfortable, and yet this is essentially what a good résumé is all about. So it’s no wonder some of us need help putting a decent one together.  Here are some tips on how to strengthen your résumé and get it to stand out from the pack. First of all, try to keep your relevant employment history, with your most recent jobs on top, to one page that’s been spell-checked and saved as a .pdf file. When you save as a .pdf, you’re locking down the formatting on your résumé so that it won’t look a mess when someone else opens up the file. As for the cover letter, don’t send this without spell-checking, either. And try to make it compelling by telling your story in the first person, while also capturing the spirit of the business you’re interested in. For example, you can start out describing your past roles: “I was a senior salesperson at Z Incorporated, where I brought in X amount of revenue per year.” Then let the reader in on your future plans by writing something like, “Now I am interested in exploring new opportunities in team-building and client relations,” and explaining how the position being offered is perfect for you.  At the same time, keep in mind the spirit of the company to which you’re applying. If it’s a super formal and straitlaced company, then don’t be too casual in your cover letter. Likewise, if it’s an easygoing organization with not a suit or tie in sight, then don’t be too stuffy in describing yourself.  If you have real data, such as readership numbers or the amount of money you’ve generated for a company, these are great details to add to your résumé, as they are clear indicators of what you can deliver. Another professional skill that may not come naturally is getting through the interview process. But like any other skill, this is one that can be improved by practice.  So whether you’re talking to yourself in the mirror or to a helpful friend, spend some time before your scheduled sit-down asking yourself questions and saying your answers aloud. It also helps to show up with a few questions of your own to show that you’re knowledgeable and curious about the company. Job interviews are already stressful, so don’t make it any worse by rushing to get there at the last minute and showing up a sweaty mess. Get there early and give yourself plenty of time to simmer down and make a cool and calm first impression. If there’s one thing that can be more stressful than interviewing for a job, it’s negotiating for a better salary or benefits. You could even say that negotiating is like dancing, since there’s a certain amount of give and take that goes on when it’s being done well. So if you feel like you have two left feet when it comes to these kinds of things, here are some tips on being a better negotiator. First of all, it’s best to know exactly what’s most important to you. For some people, it’s all about the money, but for others it’s more time off, better health care coverage or equity in the company. Knowing what’s important, and making HR aware of what really matters to you, will undoubtedly make any negotiation process run more smoothly and satisfactorily for everyone involved. It’s also best to have a good sense of timing and a certain level of preparedness before you enter negotiations. For instance, if you just botched a deal or the company just filed for bankruptcy, it’s probably not the best time to ask for a raise. But if the circumstances are right, then come prepared with solid statistics and data that show just how productive you’ve been, or that prove how your current pay rate is unusually low compared to what people in your position elsewhere are making. Now, whether you’ve just secured a chunky bonus or you’re struggling to make ends meet, it’s never a bad time to think about your financial security and figure out how you can save more. A simple way to begin is to take an honest look at your spending, identify your biggest expenses, and then ask yourself, How can I cut down on spending and put more into my savings account? One goal you may want to consider is the 50/30/20 rule. The aim here is to have 20 percent of your paycheck go into savings, or toward paying off debt or investing; to put 30 percent toward hobbies or entertainment; and to use 50 percent for necessities like food and rent. An effective way to meet this kind of goal is to set up an automatic payment plan with your bank, so that 20 percent of your paycheck is directly deposited into your savings account. This way, you won’t have to worry about transferring or not touching certain amounts in your checking account. There’s a good chance you finished school with little knowledge about how to save or invest money. So let’s cover some of the basics on how to get started. Investing doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, the first step in opening a brokerage – that is, an investment account – is quite easy. Businesses like Charles Schwab or ETrade allow you to open up an account online, and then you’re on your way to investing your money and watching it grow. As for what you should invest in, you may want to get in touch with an advisor who will help you diversify your investments so that you don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Investing in mutual funds is often recommended, since such funds are essentially a package containing a diverse selection of investments that will be managed by a firm whose job it is to make you money. Because well-managed mutual funds are so reliable, retirement plans often include them. If you want to be more involved in picking and choosing your investments, then you may like ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. These contain things like stocks and bonds; they’re traded daily, their value fluctuates regularly and you can sell and trade ETFs at any time. Likewise, if you’re into doing research and feeling lucky, you may want to focus directly on stocks and own a piece of a public company. This is risky, but the rewards can be high; your fortunes are tied to how well the company is doing. It’s still recommended that you diversify over a broad range of companies to reduce the chance of losing all your money in one fell swoop. Another significant financial concern is whether you should spend money leasing or owning property. Unless you have enough cash to pay for a house outright, owning will probably mean going the mortgage route, which often involves a loan that covers around 80 percent of the cost. This loan is then repaid, with interest, over a period of 30 years or so.  So, unless you can put down between ten and 20 percent of a home’s cost right away, you’ll probably be renting. And if you do, make sure to get renters’ insurance. This often goes for just five to 15 dollars a month, and it will mean that your possessions are covered in emergency situations such as fire, flood or theft.  That’s a small price to pay for a lot of peace of mind. Depending on how you look at it, the world is either a tiny speck in the universe, or a massive place with 7.5 billion people speaking 6,000 languages and adhering to over 4,000 different religions. What we can all agree on is that it’s complicated, especially when you factor in politics and the global economy. To understand the current geopolitical situation, let’s turn the clock back to 1914, the year Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated. This caused a huge uproar, as Ferdinand was next in line to rule the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  As the heir to the throne was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist, Austria-Hungary, along with its close ally Germany, declared war on Serbia. Things quickly escalated into an all-out world war when Germany took things farther, first by declaring war on Serbia’s major ally, Russia, and then doing the same with France and Britain. Many things that happened during World War I are still relevant to this day, including the killing of up to 1.5 million Armenians by the leaders of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the land now known as Turkey. There’s also the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which carved up the Arab lands within the by-then-fallen Ottoman Empire and divided them between Britain and France in an attempt to increase European influence in the area.  And in 1919, with the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was made to pay for the costs and damages of World War I to the tune of $33 billion. Many elements related to that treaty meant that some 14 years later, in 1933, the Nazi regime had taken hold in Germany, and World War II was soon underway. It lasted until 1945, when the only two nuclear bombs that have ever been used in armed conflict were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in Japan. A war of a different kind, the Cold War, started in 1947, when tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, former World War II allies, began to brew – largely related to the Soviets’ expansionist communist regime. This conflict would last until 1991, when the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, established more open diplomatic relations with the West. The year 1947 was also the year Britain gave up control of Pakistan and India, which sparked a conflict over Kashmir, an area located between the two countries. China also entered this conflict, which has claimed the lives of around 50,000 people. Kashmir is now divided among the three countries. A year later, the state of Israel was established on land that had been part of British-controlled Palestine. Disputes between Israel and Palestine over this land have continued ever since. In 1948, government-enforced segregation, known as apartheid, began in South Africa, following political gains made by the white-run National Party. Around 21,000 people are believed to have died as a result, before apartheid was finally abolished in 1994. Two years later, the Cold War heated up over Korea, after the Soviet-backed north invaded the US-backed south. The conflict ended in 1953, with the two regions still distinctly separated. Not long afterward, in 1955, the conflict moved to Vietnam, and went on there for two decades before communist forces prevailed. In 1959, the Soviets claimed a new partner when Fidel Castro gained control of Cuba, located just 90 miles off the coast of Florida. Unhappy with this development, the United States tried to topple Castro in 1961, in a failed operation known as the Bay of Pigs invasion. Tensions grew from there, when the United States detected the Soviets housing missiles on Cuban soil. This resulted in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and for 12 tense days the United States and Soviets sat on the brink of war until the Soviets agreed to remove the missiles. Another crisis began in 1979, when the US-backed government in Iran was replaced by an anti-US Islamic one. The coup involved storming the US embassy in Tehran, Iran’s capital city, and taking around 60 hostages, many of whom were held captive for over a year. At the same time, a communist government was taking power in Afghanistan. This led to another Cold War conflict as the United States backed the anticommunist Afghans, known as the mujahideen, while the Soviets backed the communists. Ten years passed before the communist government was defeated. The US-backed victory precipitated the Islamic extremist movement in the area, which gave birth to groups including the Taliban and al-Qaeda. A while later, in 1990, Iraq tried to expand its power by invading its oil-rich neighbor Kuwait. An international response, led by the United States and codenamed Operation Desert Storm, forced a peace deal on Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein. Among the conditions was that Iraq would get rid of all weapons of mass destruction. In 2003, the Bush administration accused Iraq of still having weapons of mass destruction and of supporting the terrorist organization al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. A US-led military coalition invasion took place, and attempts were made to install a stable democratic government – but those weapons were never found. Violence continued, with hundreds of thousands of civilians and thousands of coalition soldiers losing their lives. As you can imagine, this history of relatively recent conflicts has left some nations with strained relationships. But in the next blink we’ll look at some of the partnerships that have also emerged. We’ve covered many of the conflicts that have taken place over the past 100 years or so, but some significant alliances were made as well. For instance, one of the biggest developments following World War II was the creation of the United Nations, which has brought together 193 countries with the stated purpose of promoting peace and human rights. Every autumn, dignitaries from these countries meet in New York City for a General Assembly and address issues that are threatening peace and violating human rights.  Deciding how these issues are treated is the UN Security Council, which consists of representatives of 15 nations. Britain, France, the United States, Russia and China have a permanent seat on the Council, while ten other nations get elected on a rotating basis for two-year terms. Another important union is the European Union, which currently has 28 nations on board, forming an economic alliance designed to stabilize each other’s economies through standardized rules around trade and travel. This policy of creating more open borders among EU nations was also a response to the nationalism that led to World War I and World War II. Then there are the influential alliances known as the G7 and the G20. The G7 used to be the G8, but Russia was booted out in 2014, leaving the wealthy and industrialized countries of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Canada to deal with matters of security, energy and economy.  The G20 is an annual meeting of finance ministers and banking bigwigs from the G7 countries, as well as reps from other countries, including Saudi Arabia, Australia, China and, yes, Russia, along with others. It seems Russia’s involvement in supporting separatists during the Ukrainian conflict of 2013 and 2014 was enough to lose membership in the G8 but not the G20. Finally, there’s the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, a security coalition of 29 countries that includes many European nations as well as the United States and Canada. This was formed early in the Cold War as a response to the threat posed by the Soviet Union. An attack on one NATO ally is seen as an attack on all NATO members. Despite all these alliances, there are still many issues straining relations among a number of the world’s countries and threatening peace. Religious differences still play a role in many conflicts, including the ongoing dispute between Iran and Saudi Arabia – the majority in Iran are Shiite, while in Saudi Arabia they’re Sunni. These two nations often back the forces in Sunni-Shiite conflicts in other countries, including the civil war in Yemen. Some of the tensions in the world today are due to a rise in nationalism and populism. Often, the terms nationalism and populism get used interchangeably, and while there are similarities, there are differences, too. Let’s say there are two political candidates: a populist and a nationalist. The populist politician would have a message that calls for taking control of the government out of the hands of perceived clandestine enemies like the “elites,” while the nationalist’s agenda would be about putting the interests of the country, and the people seen as the rightful masters of that country, above all others. The reason these two ideologies have meshed in recent years is that they both tend to call for a retreat from the growing trend toward globalized trade and economies. Populism and nationalism were both issues that colored the 2016 election of Donald Trump in the United States – an election that once again exposed troubling schisms that exist within the country and raised questions about the electoral college. In America’s history, five presidents have won the election despite losing the popular vote. It happened in the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, and it happened again in 2016. As a result, many people have been wondering what’s really going on with the country’s voting system. The presidential election is unlike any other election in the United States, and this is due to the electoral college. It works like this: There are 538 electors within the electoral college, and voters in each state are actually deciding which candidate the electors in their state will vote for. Generally speaking, the candidate who gets 270 electoral votes wins the election.  How many electors a state has is directly related to how many senators and House representatives it has. For example, California has 53 House reps and two senators, earning it 55 votes in the electoral college. Rhode Island, on the other hand, has two House reps and two senators and therefore only four votes. Ultimately, this is a dated system that has ended up placing a disproportionate amount of influence on a few select states. Currently, fewer than half of the eligible voters in the United States take part in elections, and among the excuses for this sad fact has been the feeling that an individual’s vote doesn’t matter. But every vote does matter, and the good news is that 100 million voters took part in the 2018 elections. You’d have to go back over 100 years to find such a big turnout for a midterm election. So there’s hope that more Americans are now embracing the importance of civic engagement. The key message in these blinks: There’s a lot going on in the world these days, and probably a lot going on in your life. Every day can be filled with an overwhelming number of decisions to make and amount of news to keep up with. Fortunately, staying informed on the basic issues doesn’t have to be difficult or boring.  Actionable advice: Grossed out by your shower curtain? Here’s how to give it a quick clean.

Have your emotions been so frayed that going insane seems the next obvious step?  We’ve all experienced these “breaking point” moments, and it can be terrifying. So how do you avoid going crazy amid a crazy world?  These blinks give you the tools to keep your cool even when it seems the world is falling apart around you. Learning to observe yourself in the moment is crucial; equally so is encouraging moments of “positive stress.”  In doing so, you’ll find healthy ways to maintain your mental health and reassure yourself that you’ll never “lose it” again.   In these blinks, you’ll discover how your overall sanity is linked to your personal relationships; why it’s so hard to overcome feelings with reason; and how your left brain sometimes tricks your right brain. You might think of yourself as a reasonable person who makes fairly logical decisions. Yet this perception is mostly an illusion! We’re not as reasonable as we might think we are, as we’re mostly ruled by our right brain, the home of human emotion and instinct. At the age of two, the brain’s right side, as it develops, becomes more active than the left side. It’s in this right brain that your personality is formed, guided by cues from your environment.  When we’re young, our social environment is largely made up of our main caregivers. So your personality, in terms of whom you trust and with whom you bond emotionally, is formed early on based on these social surroundings. The brain’s left side, home to language, logic and reason, develops mostly from around age three. By this time, however, it’s long in the shadow of the right in terms of influence. This is why it’s so hard to overcome strong emotion with cold logic – your right brain remains dominant. Why then do we think we are inherently reasonable creatures? Well, it’s because the left brain essentially “tricks” us into thinking this way. When our right brain makes an emotional decision, our left brain in retrospect comes up with a reason that makes the decision seem logical. This process is called post-rationalization. Neuropsychologist Roger Sperry conducted an experiment in which he triggered the command to “walk” in a subject’s right brain, in a way so that the left brain was unaware. Interestingly, the subjects walked when instructed. Yet when asked why they decided to walk, they came up with random reasons, such as wanting to get a drink of water or stretch. The subjects weren’t lying, of course – they believed the justification offered by their left brains! So now you know that how you reason may not be totally reliable, given the relationship between your right and left brains. Let’s examine in this context then why we act the way we do in stressful situations. Are you able to turn your emotions on and off like a light switch? It’s impossible, even though you might try to convince yourself otherwise.  Yet we can ‒ and should – find some space to observe how we feel and who we are at our core.  Practicing self-observation is paramount to keeping your sanity, as it helps you notice and therefore alter the behaviors that stifle your well-being. By observing yourself, you can create some distance from an event to better assess your feelings and thoughts in a non-judgmental way.  Let’s say you’re furious over something a friend said to you. Instead of just being angry, try to observe your anger. This helps you to separate yourself from your feelings, and calms you down. One of the most effective methods of practicing self-observation is to keep a diary. Write down your feelings, thoughts or random memories that come to mind during the day. Then read what you wrote, looking for any places where you seem to repeat yourself or show emotional habits. Once you are aware of these moments, you can better get rid of them in the future. Another way to practice self-observation is through focused attention. Here, you focus on and experience your body and mind in the present moment. When people meditate or pray, they are using focused attention. Doing so improves your concentration and reduces anxiety and depression. So what do you do? Simply breathe. Sit down for one minute and focus on your breathing.  After a short while, you’ll notice that your mind starts to wander. When it does, gently refocus your attention on your breathing. You’ll need to practice, but soon you’ll be able to do it without effort. Through self-observation and focused attention, you create a gap between you and your thoughts and feelings, and in turn, begin to get a better handle on them. Have you ever caught yourself judging a person before you’ve even spoken one word to her? Sure, many of us have.  The problem is, judging someone prematurely can prevent you from forming a relationship that might be actually beneficial to you. Humans are social animals, and one way we all stay sane is to maintain and nurture healthy relationships. Yet too frequently we judge others based on our past experiences. Let’s say for example you were abandoned by a caregiver when you were young. As a result, you may not be able to trust people, as you assume that they, too, will disappoint you. You’re essentially projecting your past experiences on new people you don’t even know. So what can you do instead of judging others prematurely? You can work to understand the new person and her true feelings. But before you can do that, you must understand yourself. According to psychoanalyst Peter Fonagy, this means that when you’re familiar with your inner emotional life, you become more sensitive to other people’s feelings ‒ which in turn enables you to maintain and nurture relationships. If you know that you’re offended when a friend pokes fun at you, for example, you’ll realize that your friend might also be offended if you made fun of her. Therefore, you’ll know to keep any off-hand remarks to yourself! We sometimes get stuck in behavioral patterns that hold us back from having fulfilling relationships. This is where self-observation again comes in handy. Zara would fall in love yet watch as relationship after relationship would quickly fall apart within months. Tired of the heartbreak, she began observing herself and keeping a diary. She soon found a pattern. She realized that she quickly jumped into bed with every new romance, then became extremely needy and demanding in the relationship. Once she recognized the cycle, she worked hard to break it – and eventually formed a healthy, long-lasting relationship. High levels of stress can make us sick, sometimes evolving into full-blown panic or anxiety attacks. But did you know that not all stress is actually harmful?  If you want to keep your brain working like a well-oiled machine and continue to learn, experiencing moderate amounts of stress can actually help your brain’s neural pathways grow. This sort of stress is called good stress, and occurs when we engage in something new and challenging. Such activities stimulate the brain more than usual, and in turn improve the brain’s overall functioning. Importantly, good stress also promotes longevity. Welsh researcher David Snowden looked at a number of subjects and found that individuals who held a university degree and continued to learn and cultivate new interests throughout their lives were actively encouraging levels of good stress. Consequently, these individuals enjoyed significantly longer lives and were less affected by the mental deterioration often observed with age, such as dementia. But how do you cultivate good stress in your life? The answer is simple: you have to move beyond your comfort zone. Pushing beyond your comfort zone means engaging in activities that make you a little nervous. The first step is to think about which activities are within your comfort zone; these are the things you are absolutely comfortable doing, such as reading articles online. Then think about the things that you’d like to achieve, but for which you’d need a push, such as writing your own blog. Now think of something you’re pretty scared of doing, such as writing a book. The trick is to start in the middle: writing a blog. This will push you a little past your comfort zone but not so much that you’re too frightened, and at the same time will increase your self-confidence. Before long you’ll feel ready to tackle the things you didn't have the courage for before. Your brain and body will thank you for the stimulation! Whether it be fairy tales from our childhood or the latest drama series on Netflix, we’re all fascinated by a good story.  What is it about stories that capture the imagination? Stories, or narratives, help structure our thoughts as well as aid us in interpreting our daily experiences, allowing us to find meaning in our world. Many fairy tales, for example, follow a particular structure, with a villain being vanquished and a prince or princess living happily ever after. Such “happy endings” help children especially make sense of negative experiences, showing them that often things do turn out well in the end. Narratives can also instill negative views, however. Some stories can encourage prejudice or pessimism, trapping us in a pattern of negative thinking. Thus we need to be careful, ensuring to question the point of stories we share with each other. Too often, we just don’t realize how stuck we are in certain ways of thinking, and how these habits influence our behavior. Consider this “story.” A man is driving through a long stretch of desert when his tire blows out. As he pulls over to address the mishap, he realizes he can’t fix the tire himself as he has no jack. Yet he remembers that he passed by a garage only a few miles back, and starts off on a long, hot walk. Along the way, he thinks of all the times he’s had bad experiences with his car at auto shops, and the memories build until he’s quite paranoid of what is waiting for him at the desert garage.  He knows the mechanic can take advantage of him, given he has nowhere else to turn. Yet when he arrives at the garage, the friendly mechanic is all smiles – but our stranded motorist doesn’t see it. All he sees is the narrative in his head and as a result, his misplaced anger keeps him from dealing with the mechanic politely and getting the immediate help he so desperately needs. Yet don’t forget that you are not a victim of how you think. Stories are flexible; they can help us see the world in a positive light, too.  We can rewrite our stories. By editing the narratives we live by, we can change the way we think, draw more positive meaning from the world around us and fulfill our goals. Stories with a positive spin can also work wonders for personal motivation. One artist was struggling with repeated rejections from artists’ residencies. To improve her morale, the author told her a story about a salesperson who made the realization that he only made a successful sale every 50 calls. So with each rejection, the salesperson would become more excited, knowing he was actually closer to that sale. This story transformed how the artist viewed her rejections, and boosted her confidence to keep applying. Eventually, she was selected for the artist’s residency she wanted. While positive narratives can help us push through, visualizing good things happening and being optimistic can also increase our well-being. This is how we can attract more good things into our lives. Say you’re going to a party where you don't know a single person. If you enter the room with an optimistic mind-set and your head held high, you’re likely to catch someone's attention, spark up a conversation, find some common ground and learn something new. If on the other hand you wander into a gathering with your eyes to the ground, convinced that no one is interested in talking to you, you’ll probably have a terrible time. This doesn’t just apply to parties, but to life in general. Invest in optimism! Some researchers have discovered that optimists tend to have better physical and mental health and live longer than pessimists do. So pull your shoulders back and keep your head high – it might just prolong your life! The key message in this book: You can benefit tremendously from the measured observation and better understanding of your inner life. Through self-observation, thinking optimistically, pushing beyond your comfort zone and nurturing relationships, you’ll not only understand yourself better but also will be healthier and happier. Actionable advice: Sharpen your awareness with the 30-minute exercise. Sit down without any distractions for 30 minutes with a notebook and a pen. Pay attention to your breathing. When a thought crops up, write it down using one or two words, and then release it. After 30 minutes, take a look at your thoughts. They will make you more aware of your thinking patterns and empower you to change those patterns if they’re overly negative.

Who doesn’t want that? But knowing what you want is only half the battle; you also have to know how to get what you want. Written by a successful entrepreneur, this book will show you how you can achieve your goals through the very same principles used by the author himself. You’ll learn that it’s OK to be selfish and that you can’t be successful without being yourself – among other lessons. We’ve taken the eleven principles identified by the author and combined them into six easy-to-follow blinks. By following them, you, too, can become a real-life success story. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you shouldn’t dress up like Lady Gaga; how to deal with haters; and what a “brain dump” is and when it’s useful. You may think that living a good life involves pleasing others, but to fulfill your life goals, you need to first start taking care of yourself. Making yourself a priority – or being selfish – will lead to a better life not only for you but also for others around you. If you work on improving yourself, you will focus on becoming a better caregiver, parent, sibling or friend. Imagine a teacher coming to class with a bad flu instead of staying at home to rest. In his poorly state his performance is affected, and, as a result, the students won’t benefit from his being there at all. It would be better for everyone if the teacher put his own needs first and focused instead on getting better before he thought about attending to anyone else. Taking care of yourself and your life is crucial. Remember that your life is unique and so you shouldn’t be trying to live it any other way; trying to live someone else’s life would be a waste of time and energy. For example, the author took the career path he thought he should have, every week working 100 hours in corporate jobs that paid well, yet he never felt happy. In fact, he felt burnt out, stressed and unfulfilled. This was because he was following someone else’s dream and ignoring his real passion, which was to start his own business and become his own boss. Being selfish involves balance in areas of your life like nutrition, exercise and mental health. If you are sick mentally or physically, it will be difficult to start a business or approach another equally big goal. Therefore, you need to focus on keeping yourself balanced by working out and getting into shape even if you hate the thought of exercising; eating nutritious food but not being too strict about it; and developing or having a strong support group of friends and family. Stop hanging out with those who bring you down. It is important to prioritize yourself and check that key areas in your life are in balance. That way you will be fit and well enough to start working toward achieving your goals. Have you ever tried to impress someone by acting differently, either to get a job or to win over that potential partner? So many people try to fake who they are to get ahead, not realizing that this strategy is sure to backfire. Rather, the best tactic is to stop concerning yourself with what other people think of you. If you fear being judged by others, and to spare your ego, you end up losing a lot of opportunities. For example, the author used to be guided by negative feelings and “what-ifs.” He spent many years afraid to even say “hi” to people because he feared being ridiculed or simply not liked. The truth is that, of course, the reality is never as horrifying as the worst-case scenarios you imagine. What’s more, not only should you not worry about what others think of you, but you should also be willing to show your authentic, “weird” self. People can smell fakes from a mile away, and besides, your uniqueness is what will draw people to you. So don’t even try to copy Lady Gaga by donning similar costumes and ripping off her pop tunes; you’ll only turn people off because no one’s interested in a fake or a copycat. Instead, be original and trust your own ideas and personality. Sometimes it can be hard to show your real self, but you shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. We’re hesitant to ask for help or advice because we’re afraid of coming across as weak. Furthermore, we think it’s unfair to be bothering others with our problems. However, admitting that you need guidance isn’t a sign of weakness or that you’re a failure. Contrary to what most people might think, people like helping others. So when you ask someone for help, it’s a win-win situation because you’re giving them a chance to be useful and share their advice or expertise! Don’t be afraid to ask for help and don’t be afraid to be yourself. By letting go of your fears, you’ll allow yourself to open up and be honest, which is what we’ll be looking at next. Let’s be honest, nobody likes to admit their weaknesses or shortcomings – not even to themselves. But to achieve our goals, we have to be willing to look at both sides of ourselves, and not just our best aspect. Be honest with yourself, and you’ll start reaching your goals. To do this, you should first write down your strengths and weaknesses. Although you yourself should come up with your strengths, you’ll probably need others to help you list your weaknesses. Reflect on your life, focusing on where you are currently, and make it a priority to change anything you don’t like about it. The author devised a form and sent it round to his friends and colleagues, asking two questions: “What do you really think of me?” and “How can I improve?” The responses were sent anonymously, and though they were brutally honest, they helped the author gain a different perspective on what he needed to change. Another advantage of being honest is that it’ll help you discover areas where you can be of value to others. People appreciate those who are ready to admit that they’re not the best but that they are pretty great at what they can do, and that they still have some room for improvement. Only once you’ve identified your strengths and weaknesses can you show others where your skills lie. After recognizing those key areas, you can start to generate work around them, making sure you set your prices to reflect your skill level so that you’re charging less in the beginning. When the author was starting out as a personal trainer, he charged £15 per hour. Only after he gained more experience and confidence in his skills did he begin charging around £100. Take a deep, honest look at yourself and evaluate your skills. Focus on improving areas in which you shine, and you’ll be increasing your value in no time. Once you have the momentum to lift your project or goal off the ground, you’ll want to tell people about it, and for that, you need to be interesting. Being an interesting person helps draw attention to your products before your business becomes well known. To become more interesting and well-rounded, you must build and develop your own opinions and thoughts – on books and articles, for example. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, you can share your insights with others. And remember, having a diverse range of interests will make you all the more appealing. Another great strategy for being interesting can be summed up in the quote, “If you want to be interesting, be interested.” This means that you should be legitimately interested in what makes other people tick. When the author wants to find out what motivates other people, he asks them a simple question: “So, how do you spend your free time?” Bear in mind, however, that not everyone will think you’re interesting, or even like you. Instead of letting it demotivate you, use this spitefulness to boost you into action. Haters are going to hate, and the hard truth is that there’s no way to get rid of them. But be mindful that some judgments contain a small piece of truth; understand these slight criticisms to help you grow. Make sure that you’re able to separate the jealousy-filled comments from constructive criticism. It’s not helpful if someone tells you that your business is awful, but if they tell you that your business doesn’t have a logo, which means it might fail, then there’s some valuable information you can use. Also, keep in mind that there will always be hatred toward those who are doing well or doing their own thing. Haters are jealous and feel threatened because they haven’t achieved the same level of success in their own lives. Understand that the hate is their problem and not yours, and walk away from it. Now that you’ve got the gist of why being yourself, being honest about your abilities and finding a supportive network are important for living an awesome life, the next blink will show you how to turn your healthy habits into concrete goals. It’s not possible to talk about goals without using the words “plans” or “habits” in the same sentence. OK, maybe it is, but hopefully, you get the idea just how vital planning and habits are in making anything happen. To start planning, you need to set up your priorities with a one-two-three ranking system. This system was developed by the author, who was first struck with the idea when he observed a successful man from his town. This man achieved all of his goals by his twenties by tackling three to five items on his to-do list every day. Improving upon this system, the author added a one-two-three ranking, marking each task from a one (a supreme priority) to a three (not critical). Before starting this ranking system, make sure you have a “brain dump.” This is where you scribble down all your ideas, tasks and things to be accomplished on a piece of paper so that you can clearly see and identify which need prioritizing. So, planning your habits seems easy enough, but how can you find the time to do it? One strategy is to try “the dentist appointment,” where you set aside a daily one-hour time slot to complete a certain task, rather like setting aside time for a check-up. Make sure you have a reliable environment that holds no distractions and where you can consistently work. The author preferred planning and doing concentrated work on the train. He picked a journey that would take two hours so he could take a break at his destination and then commit two more hours to working on the return trip. So, we’ve discussed planning and routine, but there are still two more important principles coming up that will keep you on the path to success. Ever shared your goals and aspirations with a friend or family member, only for them to not understand, or be unable to relate? This is why motivation and inspiration are best fueled by connecting with people who have similar dreams. But who exactly should you be looking for, and where? It’s vital that you don’t just surround yourself with those whom you look up to, but also with people who are chasing similar goals. You could try joining or creating a Facebook community that focuses on your goals, invest in a mentor or coach to help you improve or attend seminars or workshops with your target audience. The latter is just what the author did; he went to classes with fitness professionals, and through natural conversations, he was able to spread the word about his fitness-focused copywriting business and gather clients organically. Finally, remember that people are the fundamental blocks that build most of your goals and businesses, so don’t forget to be pleasant to them. Always give credit to those who have helped you – you never know when you’ll need their support again. Conversely, for those who try and shut you down – the haters – don’t react or lash out. Perhaps try replying to them when you’re in a calmer and happier mood, but not when you’re upset. A good tip is to avoid checking your email first thing in the morning until you’ve established the right mood. Also, consider what the haters are going through and that they’re maybe having a rough time – perhaps they’re experiencing a financial crisis, have just lost a loved one or experienced a health scare. These events could cause anyone to act out of character, so try your hardest to be understanding and patient. We’ve covered a lot of ground today in these blinks, but now it’s time to take in all the information and put it to use. Half of the work is learning, and the other half is action. Don’t just read this and continue with your day as you normally would; put these principles to use immediately in your very next project. The key message in this book: Now is the time to be fearless and strike out toward your goals. Don’t let haters or insecurities take advantage of your limited time in this life. Instead, think about what you really want and make it happen! Actionable advice: Emotionally detach yourself from the outcome One important principle to begin practicing right away is letting go of the unknown outcome of a situation – that is, letting go of the crippling fear over whether your project will be a dud or a success. Detach yourself emotionally from the outcome as this will decrease your stress and make everything feel lighter and more manageable. Remember, the real failure is in not trying at all. Got feedback?

Perhaps you texted someone you liked and were flatly rejected, or maybe you made a major blunder at work in front of all your colleagues. That feeling? It’s shame – a complex blend of embarrassment, pain and a sense of isolation that makes you suspect your mistake somehow marks you as a mediocre or deeply fallible person. But in the end, absolutely everyone is fallible. Realizing that mistakes, and the profoundly negative feelings they can prompt, are shared by many helps to mitigate our experience of shame, and can let us feel safe in the knowledge that we’re not alone. In these blinks, you’ll learn what can trigger shame; how empathy can be a powerful antidote to shame; and why we should all give up on the pursuit of perfection. There are plenty of uncomfortable topics of conversation that most of us will try to steer clear of, but one subject that people particularly loathe discussing is the emotion of shame. As a result, many of us don’t have a proper understanding of what it really is. Shame is a visceral emotion whose exact characteristics are difficult to describe, but at its core, it has to do with a feeling of not being good enough. Articulating such an experience can be difficult – after all, discussing shame requires us to, at least to a certain degree, relive the pain it causes. That being said, when the author interviewed over 300 people about how they experience shame, she discovered a theme; shame is a negative feeling connected to a sense of rejection and the exposure of aspects of ourselves that we tend to hide. Based on this information, the author put together the following definition: shame is a deeply painful sensation that stems from the belief that we’re not good enough, and that this shortcoming will prevent us from being accepted by and belonging to a group. But how does shame arise? Most often, shame occurs when people seek compassion, but experience rejection instead. For instance, one participant in the author’s study spoke about how her mother persistently shamed her because of her weight. When the participant visited her mother, the first words out of her mother’s mouth would be about how she was still fat, and the last would be about how she hoped her daughter could lose weight before they saw each other next. Or consider another participant whose mother committed suicide when she was in high school. It was a time when she needed support and compassion, but she was instead ostracized by her fellow students for being the daughter of a crazy lady who hung herself. Even from these examples, it’s clear that a lack of empathy precipitates shame, and that’s precisely what we’ll explore next. If you get bitten by a venomous snake, you can receive a dose of antivenom that will save you. This is a dramatic example of the many antidotes available to us, and thankfully, a powerful antidote also exists for the feeling of shame – it’s called empathy. Since everyone experiences shame, what truly matters is that we learn how to manage it. Every participant interviewed by the author pointed to empathy as the essential factor in quickly overcoming and recovering from shame. However, receiving empathy from others isn’t the only important step; it’s also essential for you to empathize with them. Most people first feel empathy by sharing a difficult experience with another person and hearing them say that they understand. Knowing that another person has experienced what you’re experiencing, and that it’s not unusual or uncommon, makes you feel less isolated and more accepted. But to achieve this understanding, you need to be able to see things from the other person’s perspective without passing judgment, which means being present and aware of the other person’s story. For instance, one year, the author was overwhelmed by the number of tasks she had to complete one weekend. She had promised to bring cookies to a party at her daughter’s school, but she forgot. In her embarrassment, she lied to the teacher, claiming a dessert brought by another visitor as her own contribution. Later, when she told a friend about this, the friend responded by saying that the author had done her best, that she was juggling too many things and didn’t want to make a bad impression on the teacher. This response was purely empathetic; there was no judgment, just a simple taking of the author’s perspective. You now have some sense of how to relieve shame. Next up, you’ll learn how to identify when exactly you’re experiencing it. Have you ever felt like you’re coming down with some sort of illness, but just decided to ignore it? If you have, you likely learned that listening to yourself is important to your physical health – and the same goes for your mental health. As such, to deal with shame, you first need to recognize it. Through her research, the author found that the people who could notice and precisely describe their shame were much better at handling it. Some of these people, when confronted with shame, might get a dry mouth and have difficulty swallowing. Others turn red and start shaking, while still others become incapable of even getting out of bed. However it manifests, noticing your shame enables you to overcome it, because to truly deal with shame, you also need to understand what triggers it. Accurately identifying shame lets you start looking for these triggers. That being said, there are no universal causes of shame, since it’s largely dependent on negative personal experiences from early on in one’s life. For instance, one of the people interviewed by the author, Sylvia, made an error at work and found herself on the company’s loser list, a piece of paper posted in the hallway detailing all the people who had messed up that month. While others might have shrugged it off, Sylvia, who grew up with an extremely competitive father, simply couldn’t. Her father had always told her and her sister that nobody likes losers, and that there’s nothing worse than being one. Naturally, being publicly shamed as a loser was deeply triggering for her. The good news is that by knowing the triggers of your own shame, you can take a step back when it starts to flare up. Doing so will give you a better shot at processing the emotion and emerging with a positive feeling on the other side. On one occasion, while giving a presentation on critical awareness to a pharmaceutical company, the author found herself losing the interest of her audience. Rather than feeling shame or panic, she simply told them that they seemed more interested in the pizza that would follow the presentation than in her talk. By doing so, she was exercising awareness of herself. She went on to explain that she knew they only had a short lunch break and that the pizza was a major incentive for them to be there at all. By pointing this out, she was displaying critical awareness. This all-important ability refers to understanding both why and how something happens. Critical awareness is vital to handling shame because it gives us the ability to zoom out. After all, when we feel ashamed, we can’t really think of anything else. By taking a step back we can notice the social causes of our shame and address it more easily and effectively. For instance, when we complain about our frizzy hair, our freckles or the size of our bellies, it can feel like we’re the only ones experiencing such thoughts. But the reality is that beauty and body image are almost universal triggers for shame. To understand these thoughts, we need to look at society and understand the expectations it places on us. Not only that, but critical awareness helps us see when we’re being manipulated. By zooming out even further, we can see that there’s an entire industry fuelling our negative feelings regarding body image, and that we consume its content in the form of magazines and TV shows. Such media makes us feel shame, and that’s exactly what this industry wants; this shame is what makes us spend so much money trying to live up to impossible standards of beauty and attractiveness. Naturally, the results of such a process are disastrous. For instance, some 7 million women in the United States alone suffer from eating disorders. But by being able to see this bigger picture, we can realize how others suffer too, normalizing shame and taking away its sting. When we feel hurt or ashamed, a common reaction is to retreat into ourselves. However, what we actually need is to do exactly the opposite; connecting with others is crucial to healing from the experience of shame. The opposite of shame is self-esteem. There is a broad tendency to believe that certain things, namely a successful career or a terrific outfit, will boost our self-esteem – but the reality is entirely different. The psychologists Jean Baker Miller and Irene Stiver found in a 1997 study that forming and maintaining relationships is the most reliable way to make people feel grounded and sure of their value. And this is especially true when it comes to shame. Having friendships and support networks through which we can share our life experiences shows us how others share our difficulties. This removes the isolation from shame, makes it easier to manage and can change the way we see other people. We can even help other people heal by reaching out to them. Such an ability is so powerful that we can actually transform shameful experiences into positive ones. Just take a participant interviewed by the author, whose father was married to a younger woman and whose mother was married to a man with six previous wives. She was often shamed for the eccentric marital histories of her parents, and when she hears someone being judged for having a strange family she shares the story about her own. When it comes down to it, we all have weird families, each with its own imperfections. It’s only because we habitually lie about such things that visible imperfections are met with ridicule. Most of us know that the perfection we see depicted on TV isn’t real. But it’s still easy to get sucked into the illusion that it is. This is a prime example of how perfection is a shame-producing lie. Just take Alex, the iconic 1980s character played by Jennifer Beals in the movie Flashdance. In the famous dance audition scene, Alex nails an incredible number that combines ballet and breakdance. But in reality, the scene is a combination of Jennifer Beals’ face, a professional ballet dancer, a top gymnast and even a male breakdancer. With enough editing and polish, movie scenes or photo shoots end up providing the false image of perfection that we get from the mass media. Naturally, the major problem with such images is that we’re led to believe that we should admire and emulate these perfect humans; who wouldn’t feel ashamed trying to live up to such an unrealistic ideal? But there’s another issue with the perfection lie: it makes it difficult to fill human roles, like that of a caregiver. After all, if we expect to be perfect, we’ll expect it from others too. This can only lead to difficulty in imperfect situations, such as caring for an elderly parent who is losing his cognitive faculties. As a result, caregivers are often extremely hard on themselves, disappointed by their feelings of resentment. For instance, one of the author’s interviewees, Chelsea, cared for her mother for two years before putting her into a nursing home. But when she did, she was overcome by guilt and shame for not having been able to do everything by herself. It’s clear that such ideals of perfection aren’t healthy, and a good way to overcome them is to show the opposite: vulnerability. By accepting our own limitations in such situations, we can alleviate many of our shameful feelings. Have you ever totally lost it on someone just so you didn’t have to be honest about how hurt, ashamed or embarrassed you were feeling? It’s a common reaction, and anger is a tempting tool with which to hide shame. In fact, shame even appears to be directly related to blaming, as people are constantly pointing fingers to avoid confronting their feelings. Psychologists June Tangney and Ronda Dearing say that people can protect themselves from their shame by projecting it outward and blaming others through a self-righteous burst of anger. Essentially, this is a way for people to regain control over their shame by exerting power. However, anger really just makes things worse. Many of the people the author interviewed admitted that they invariably regretted the angry outbursts that resulted from their shame. While such explosions might feel good in the moment because they relieve some of the pain, in the long run, they are simply detrimental to relationships. People can become alienated because they can’t understand where their anger is coming from. This, in turn, isolates the angry person, producing more shame as their connection to the other is weakened. But that doesn’t mean everybody should suppress their anger. Anger is actually a healthy emotion – just not when it’s hiding another one. That’s why, if you’re feeling shame, it’s important to try to stay with it, describe it and reach out to other people. You now know that anger can be a mere mask for shame, that focussing on perfection isn’t a solution and that it’s essential to avoid being trapped by shame. Rather than letting yourself fall into these unhealthy patterns, let yourself be vulnerable, turn to those around you to forge connections and share the empathy that you and others need to heal. The key message in this book: We’ve all experienced shame and we’ll all experience it again at some point down the road. Rather than trying to ignore this inevitability of life, it’s essential to acknowledge and normalize it. By doing so, we can constructively deal with this painful emotion, connect with others and emerge from a difficult experience with our self-esteem intact. Got feedback?

And yet, people still continue to watch romantic movies, featuring passionate love and someone finding real joy in their professional pursuits. So, deep down, most people probably are still longing for such things. But when one starts thinking seriously about achieving happiness, the mind often focuses on the negative: there are dirty dishes in the sink, you never learned how to play the guitar and, sure, you may have a nice partner, but that person isn’t exactly a passionate lover. It would seem that something will always be missing. So how can happiness be discovered when the human mind tends to focus on what’s lacking? In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should value happiness more; how to connect easily with other people; and why you do have control over your happiness, just not in the way you think. You’re a smart person, right? So why do you always end up falling into the same depressing ruts? It might have something to do with the seven deadly sins. Now, we’re not talking about biblical sins, but rather the bad habits that get in the way of happiness. The first sin is the human habit of devaluing happiness. Despite our desire to be happy, we tend to ignore happiness as a goal and not give it the priority it deserves. The author, along with fellow professors Sunaina Chugani from City University of New York and Ashesh Mukherjee from McGill University, conducted a study to determine what things people associate with happiness. Participants were asked to make three wishes for things that they believed would lead to happiness. The researchers found that generally, people wish for things like money, fame and success because they know what they’re getting. Meanwhile, they tended to ignore happiness itself because it seems too abstract a concept to wish for. But if you think about it, shouldn’t happiness be everyone’s top priority? Of course different things make different people happy – so before you can prioritize happiness, you need to define it. Ask yourself what emotion you associate with happiness. This way you can learn to better understand where it comes from. Perhaps you associate happiness with love; if this is the case, your relationship with your partner is probably central to your well-being. With this in mind, try creating a journal to record all the different things that bring happiness into your daily life. Recall all the memorable moments of happiness and write down what you were doing, who you were with and what led to those positive feelings. Maybe you were traveling with someone you love, and seeing the world, or maybe you were spending time with your family during the holidays. Once you have these events written down, you’ll have a clear picture of the kind of things you should be focusing on and making time for in your life, thereby letting in more happiness. What would you rather have, a brand new BMW or a new friend? This kind of question gets to the heart of the second deadly sin: chasing superiority. One thing that many people learn in life is that feeling superior to others does not produce happiness.   Yet people continue striving to achieve a feeling of superiority, even making it a goal, and end up unhappily pursuing it for the rest of their life.   In order to feel superior, you must measure yourself against others. If you can do something better than someone else, you’re doing well; if not, you need to improve. The problem with this approach is that it implies that your failure to perform better than someone else makes you a failure. Sure, it’s natural to feel good about a job well done, but that doesn’t have to lead to the pursuit of a sense of superiority. Studies show that the more we compare ourselves to others, the less happy we are because it sets us up to obsess over every possible failure and how we look in the eyes of others. The better path to happiness is to pursue your own flow.    The concept of flow originated with the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who describes it as a blissful state of total immersion in an activity. It could be anything from sports to woodworking or solving a complex puzzle – anything that makes you zone out and lose track of time. In this state of flow, you can experience perfect focus and pure enjoyment of the moment, which also sets up the ideal conditions to learn a skill. No matter who you are, finding your flow is deeply satisfying and enjoyable. So when you’re thinking about what to do with your life, don’t chase a sense of superiority. Rather, find an activity that you love to immerse yourself in and can bring you into the flow. One of our strongest desires is to connect with others, but one should be careful how one goes about forging human connections. This leads us to the third deadly sin: desperately seeking love. An unhealthy desire to connect manifests itself as a desperation for intimacy that includes neediness and avoidance of intimacy altogether, which can often be traced back to the earliest months of our lives. In a series of studies started by psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1970s and 1980s, newborn babies who are deprived of parental affection were found to become insecure and lacking in self-esteem later on in life. And as the subjects grew into adulthood, they were found to be especially prone to both neediness and avoidance of intimacy. Naturally, this kind of behavior only increases the chances of them being lonely because neediness is not an attractive feature. People tend to be uninterested in things that are easily available, which is why people who are the most desperate for connection often end up alone. But making human connections definitely makes us happier. One massive study followed a selection of men from when they entered college in 1938 all the way into the late 2000s. Researchers discovered that the happiest men were those who had the strongest relationships. And the best way to cultivate meaningful connections is by having an altruistic spirit. When we help others and make them feel happy, we gain a sense of accomplishment and learn that we can spread happiness. This improves our self-image and makes us more capable of connecting with others, as well as making us more attractive. And because generosity raises our own happiness levels, it comes very naturally to us. In 2012, researchers handed out treats to 20 toddlers, asking them to share the treats with a puppet. They found that while the toddlers were happy to receive treats, they were even happier after they shared them with the puppet. The fourth deadly sin is wanting too much control. A lot of people feel most comfortable when they have total control over their environment and everyone in it. But the truth is, this is always going to lead to unhappiness and increased tension because we can never truly be in complete control. And we shouldn’t want to be. Think about it – you probably don’t like to feel controlled, so it’s only logical that others don’t like to feel controlled by you either. Let’s say you try to control your partner's diet by pushing him toward healthier food. There’s a good chance he’ll start eating more junk food just to show you that he’s in control of what he eats. Plus, he’ll likely resent you for being critical of his dietary habits. Feeling the need for control can also lead to your finding more unhappiness in everyday situations. In a 2008 study by psychologist Robert Vallerand, participants with a high need for control of external events were placed in an overcrowded and uncomfortable room. Predictably enough, these participants were more distressed and unhappy than the other participants. To give yourself a better chance for happiness, then, focus on finding internal control over your thoughts and feelings. This will help you both take responsibility for your own happiness and stop blaming outside circumstances for how you feel. So rather than falling into a depression when your significant other has to leave town after you’ve spent a week together, try to stay happy and remain focused and appreciative of the moments you were able to share. By taking responsibility and exerting internal control, you can also choose not to expose yourself to situations or people that you know are bad for you. So if there’s a particular person who always puts you in a bad mood, you can try to avoid crossing paths with that person. Have you ever received a perfectly nice present from someone, only to have it tainted by your suspicion that it was given with an ulterior motive? This scenario is related to the fifth deadly sin: constantly distrusting other people. Sadly, we all have a natural tendency to worry that we could be betrayed by another person at any moment. We’ve evolved to be distrustful because for our early ancestors, distrusting others improved chances of survival. A certain wariness made it more likely that one would live another day and procreate. Distrust is also an effort to protect ourselves from the painful feeling of having our heart broken. Relationship expert John Gottman found that to overcome one incident of untrustworthy behavior, we need the person who broke our trust to be trustworthy five times before they’re fully forgiven.   But if we want to live a happier life, it’s best to learn how to be understanding and forgiving. If you’ve been betrayed, don’t wallow in unhappiness; instead, minimize the pain and try to understand the other person’s side of things. If you hate someone for what he’s done, try putting yourself in his shoes and see if you can’t come to understand his behavior and motivations, even just a little bit. Chances are, you probably can. Maybe his actions have something to do with his genetics or upbringing, or even his own fears. Understanding is the key to forgiveness, and forgiveness is one of the most powerful ingredients for happiness. You’ll find that it’s much easier to forgive once you understand the personal benefits of forgiving. Forgiveness doesn’t mean that you need to keep the person you forgive close to you; all it means is that you let go of the hate and anger, and know that you can move on with your life. Once you learn to forgive, you’ll find that trust will come more easily. The sixth deadly sin is being either too passionate or too indifferent about the events in your life. Here we find two different pursuits that can lead to unhappiness. One is the obsessive pursuit of passion and the other the indifferent pursuit of passion. Being too passionate is like being too stubborn or inflexible about the goals you hope to reach. With this perspective, the only good, or happy, things in life are whatever brings you closer to your goal. That means everything else is bad, and thus you’ll be unwilling to adapt to and unhappy about the many changes and realities life has in store. Let’s say your goal is to marry someone and have two children. If it doesn’t happen, you’ll surely be unhappy, but if it does happen, you might discover that you’re still unhappy because some aspect of your plan didn’t turn out as perfectly as it should have. Either way, you’ll be the one standing in the way of your own happiness. Conversely, someone who’s indifferent to the pursuit of passion is a person who doesn’t care at all about what happens. Such people aren’t interested in or curious about their own life and might even marry someone they don’t like just for the hell of it. Neither of these perspectives is good – so it’s best to find the healthy middle ground: the dispassionate pursuit of passion. With this perspective, you have a preference of how you’d like things to happen, but you’re flexible if it doesn’t turn out that way. In fact, you can be accepting and understand that negative experiences can actually become a positive. All this requires is some patience and the realization that events we originally thought were nothing but horrible can transform into the most meaningful moments in our lives. Even if you get fired, it could very well end up putting you on a new career path that’s twice as rewarding as before. We really do learn the most from the biggest challenges we face. We now come to the last, but not the least, of the deadly sins: mind addiction – that is, the very natural tendency to overthink – which can distract us from our intuition. When we make rash or poor decisions, we often blame our instincts, yet instinctual behavior is far from random. Our intuition is connected to our evolutionary past and can pick up on details we might not be consciously aware of. In a Harvard University study, students were shown three-second video clips of various professors without any sound, and they were asked to provide an assessment of the teacher’s personality. Sure enough, by following their intuition, students were able to use this modicum of information to accurately predict what would appear in their end-of-semester teaching evaluations. Indeed, our instincts are quite finely attuned, and yet we spend a lot of time being distracted from what they are trying to tell us. This is why practicing mindfulness is a great way to reconnect with ourselves. To start with, try focusing on your breathing. Be patient and attentive, and allow yourself to notice your thoughts while at the same time letting them pass without engaging them. This will help you to avoid getting caught in the GATE web, which stands for Goals, Action, Thoughts and Emotions and illustrate how they beget one another. Let’s say you’re in your boss’s office getting a verbal warning for doing something wrong. This might lead to negative thoughts about your boss, which then provokes negative emotions. Finally, you take the action of yelling back at her with the goal of making her feel bad too. But wait, step back from the web and instead take a deep breath and focus on your inhalations and exhalations. There is a way to leave these situations with a healthy emotional state. It might sound too simple, but focusing on your breathing is a remarkably effective way to be calmer and more mindful. Smart people often overthink themselves into unhappiness. So try to use your smarts to avoid the seven deadly sins of unhappiness. The key message in this book: We can find happiness when we focus on the right things. Put yourself on the right track by finding flow in your everyday life and by making healthy, sincere and loving connections with the people around you. Happiness is not something you have to chase; it comes from within. So remember to breathe, connect with your own intuition and give your mind a rest. Happiness isn’t as unattainable as you might think. Actionable advice: Find your answer in your gut The next time you find yourself overthinking a situation, take a moment to find a comfortable position where you can sit for a while. Now start imagining your thoughts as clouds, and watch them drift by without getting in their way. While this is going on, slowly bring your attention to your breath and the air going in and out of your lungs. You will notice that your mind gets quieter, and the answer to your question may emerge from your gut instead of from your mind. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

They fear how people perceive them and struggle to shake off the nagging doubts that they are small and insignificant – that their voice doesn’t matter. Well, Jessica Honegger is living proof that you should do away with your fears, step outside of your comfort zone and live a life of meaning and purpose. Honegger once hosted a jewelry sale to fund her goal of adopting a Rwandan orphan and generate income for poor artisans in Uganda at the same time. She didn’t know it at the time, but her home jewelry sale would, over several years, grow into a $17-million business run by 4,000 Noonday ambassadors, supporting thousands of artisans, many of them women, in countries across the globe. With no business know-how but some Christian faith, more than a little fear and a whole lot of determination, Honegger stepped outside of her comfort zone. In doing so, she achieved her dream of adoption, built a socially responsible business and discovered a life of purpose. In these blinks, you’ll learn why courage, even imperfect courage, is better than comfort; the importance of showing vulnerability; and how you can stop chasing impossible ideals and value yourself as you are. Jessica Honegger never intended to start Noonday, her jewelry and fashion business; it all kind of happened by accident. What she initially intended to do was adopt a child. Years earlier, on a trip to Africa, she held a young child, orphaned after her parents died from AIDS, in her arms. From that moment on, she knew in her heart that the next step for her family would be, eventually, to adopt. Unfortunately, international adoption is expensive, and just at the time their plan for adoption was coming together, the housing market collapsed. Since she and her husband were making a living from refurbishing and reselling properties, their income disappeared too. Honegger needed a side hustle, and she needed it now. She remembered that friends of hers in Uganda had been bemoaning the fact that two incredible local artists, Jalia and Daniel Matovu, a husband and wife team, had no way of selling their artisan crafts for a price their work deserved. Honegger made a decision. She would host a sale for the Matovus’ products to friends and family back in Austin, as well as clothes from her own closet and anything else she could find. She wasn’t sure whether it would work; in fact, she was slightly afraid none of her friends would turn up to her sale, and of what people would think of her. But it worked. Her friends showed up. They cared about her journey toward adoption and were captivated by the connections between fashion and impact, style and history, profit and purpose that came together in the sale of these beautiful Ugandan objects. After an hour, Honegger had sold almost everything. That night, she realized she was on to something. Her first sale led to a second, and a third. She emailed the Matovus asking for more stock while wiring money back to them. Honegger had no experience in business, but she had a whole lot of courage - the courage to stand up and pursue what she cared about. With the help of friends and a little common sense, she turned her hustle into an international business employing and supporting, among others, thousands of women in the United States and around the world. And what started as a dream for adoption later turned into a reality, as the following year, the Honeggers welcomed Rwandan orphan Jack Honegger into their home. For those of us from privileged backgrounds, comfort is an easy option. Staying in your comfort zone is, well, comfortable. For most of us, settling in on the couch to binge-watch Netflix while sipping a warm tea or glass of wine sounds like an ideal plan. It brings a sense of safety, security, comfort and the nice feeling that things are alright – after all, not much can go wrong during a Netflix binge. Many of us go through life seeking comfort, choosing a pizza night on the couch over going out and learning something new or meeting new people. It seems we can’t get hurt by staying in and sticking with what’s familiar. But what does this comfort really offer us? A boring life, in which we have no impact and live in a spiritual void. A better approach is to choose courage, not comfort. For the author, courage had always meant complete fearlessness. Courage evokes thoughts of Martin Luther King Jr, who stood up for what he believed in, despite facing threats to his life. Or of the firefighters who ran toward danger on 9/11, while everyone around them ran away from it. But the truth is that for most of us, courage is something a little less bold. For the author, courage was pursuing her adoption process despite having a near-empty bank account; courage was opening up her home for a jewelry sale, not knowing whether any of her friends would turn up. It may have been imperfect courage, but that was the only kind she had. And making that choice, to embrace risk instead of accepting her lot in life – to run scared toward her goal – changed her life profoundly. It led to her successful adoption and also launched a business career that she, as a house flipper and educationalist with no business experience, never imagined she could lead. And, in doing so, she managed to forge connections with thousands of inspiring women, who themselves were finding their own courage daily, in the company’s US offices and abroad. Do you also have goals in life but feel unable to break through your fears? What follows is a guide to how you too can find the imperfect courage that you need to get up and chase your dreams head-on. A study by political scientists at Brigham Young University recently found that if women are the minority in a group that is trying to solve a problem they speak up to 75 percent less than the men in the group do. Girls and women are trained by society to be nice, polite and humble, and not to speak out. But if you want to achieve your full potential and follow your dreams, you have to speak up. When the Honeggers’ adoption of their child, Jack, was nearly complete, there was just one final, crucial step. They needed official permission from a local judge in Rwanda – and they needed it urgently. On very short notice, Rwanda was changing its policies on international adoption, and any delay could mean losing the opportunity to adopt Jack. Unfortunately, their attorneys told them that immediate granting of permission almost never happened. So Honegger went and waited at the judge’s office, along with her husband and other prospective adoptive parents. Facing up to the possibility of losing her new baby boy, the author decided that she couldn’t just wait for her family’s fate to be decided for them. She had no idea of acceptable etiquette in such a situation in Rwanda and was wracked with nerves. But she stood up, stepped forward and addressed the judge. She told him what an honor it was to be in his country and to meet with him. And she told him that all those present would be honored if they could be granted permission to take their children out of the orphanage that day. To the shock of the attorneys and the judges’ staff, he acquiesced. Everyone’s adoptions were approved that day. If Honegger hadn’t had the courage to stand up and speak out, the process could have dragged on and all the scheduled adoptions would have been in jeopardy. Whenever Honegger is tempted to keep quiet, she thinks back to that moment and is reminded of the power of embracing her fear, standing up and speaking out. So if you ever find in life that you have a nagging feeling in your gut and that you should stand up and say something, then listen to it. Respond to those thoughts and don’t let your fear hold you back. There is a world of opportunity out there if you’re willing to stand up, step out and reach for it. When Honegger was a schoolchild, she hated sports. In particular, she hated one exercise in gym class. A teacher would hand one end of a rope to Honegger and the other end to one of the fastest kids in school. The other kid was told to run off at her normal pace, and Honegger just had to try and keep up. Sweating and panting, she’d chase around, desperately trying to maintain the pace. It was a miserable experience, but sadly one that millions of women are replicating every day. Too many women have internalized the idea that they need to keep up with others. This is particularly true when it comes to body image. One international study showed that 98 percent of women want to change at least something about their physical appearance. So unless you are one of the incredibly lucky 2 percent, chances are that you are chasing what you believe is a better version of yourself, instead of loving who you are. So how can we get better at embracing our true worth? First, take a global perspective. In the United States, thinness is highly prized. According to the author, though, many African women regard big hips as beautiful, because they show you are living a life of plenty. And, she says, many Latin Americans value gold front teeth as both beautiful and a sign that you can afford dental treatment. So whatever your imperfections are, from frizzy hair to a little extra cushion on your bones, remember that there is a culture somewhere that values these traits as beautiful. Recognizing that standards are subjective is one thing; another challenge is to speak and think kindly to yourself. One practical way to get better at this is to reconsider the labels you attach to yourself and to others. If you call yourself “unstylish,” change that to, “I’m a person who struggles with style sometimes.” If you find yourself saying, “I’m flat-chested,” say instead that you are “a person who has smaller breasts.” Why? Well, you may struggle with style, your breast size, your weight or any number of your features of traits, but this does not define you. Put yourself, as a whole person with dignity, at the center of your own conversation. We all have parts of ourselves – particularly those parts that contain our fears and anxieties – that we prefer to keep to ourselves. The thing is, it’s only when we share those parts that we can truly connect with others, invite support, empathy and compassion, and build true and meaningful relationships. It’s not always easy to reveal our vulnerabilities, but doing so can have a powerful effect. It could even be a life-changer, as in the case of a young Ugandan girl named Hope. In Uganda, HIV carries a huge stigma and, as a result, many people hide their positive diagnoses. Hope’s mother had contracted HIV and passed it on to Hope during pregnancy. When Hope discovered her condition as a girl, she was filled with shame. She denied the reality of her condition and became iller. Hope’s mother pleaded with Jalia Matovu, Honegger’s artisan friend, to persuade Hope to take treatment. For Hope, admitting her vulnerability – in this case, her HIV diagnosis – to Matovu, was the first step in her treatment and was almost too much for her to bear. But Matovu not only heard Hope’s story, she accepted it with empathy and compassion. Hope’s sense of shame disappeared, and she learned that owning her vulnerability was the only way she could emerge from her pain. Today, Hope lives like someone with nothing to be ashamed of. In treatment, and open about her condition, she is both happy and healthy. Early on in Honegger’s journey, she also spent a lot of time hiding her vulnerability: her anxiety that when it came to business, she wasn’t the real deal. She was worried that if people knew the truth behind her business story – that it all started in a spare room in her home and that she muddled her way through – then they wouldn’t regard her as a legitimate businesswoman. Working with other women and listening to their stories, Honegger started to see the benefits of practicing vulnerability and embracing the truth of her life and business. Whenever she got invited to speak on a panel with super-successful business leaders, she’d be honest. She’d introduce herself by saying that she didn’t want to fake it anymore, and would openly admit that she had no experience leading an executive team, just a lot of experience hustling. And the more open she was about her vulnerabilities, the more she experienced true connection with other people, because she was able to show her whole, true self. Try it yourself and embrace your own vulnerabilities. After all, what is a more valuable thing to share than the reality of who you are? Have you ever encountered another woman in a store, at the beach or in a cafe and judged her? Perhaps because she looked more attractive and thinner than you, you resented her at that moment? Or maybe because her kids were misbehaving, you felt a little disdain for her parenting? Honegger once found herself in such a situation in a shoe store. Another woman was shopping while her children were causing a fuss, making noise and crashing into displays. But as Honegger found herself slipping into judgmental thoughts, she remembered that, on a different day, this could have been Honegger herself, with her own kids. So instead of judging, she started to play with one of the children. She also started talking with the mom, who said she had recently moved to Texas from Egypt. The mom, Honegger realized, was doing her best, struggling with everyday tasks while adjusting to a new life. At that moment, Honegger also realized that if you want to build a better world, women need to look at each other with compassion and understanding, not judgement. Women need a Sisterhood. And this Sisterhood, at its best, can be an unstoppable force. After Noonday took off, Honegger’s Ugandan partner, Jalia Matovu, hired new women for her workshop in Uganda. One of them, Nakato, often arrived at work with a bruised face and body. She was obviously upset, and Matovu suspected domestic violence but wasn’t sure what she could do. When Nakato arrived at work one day so badly bruised that she could barely open her eyes, Matovu decided enough was enough. She summoned up her courage, walked down to the police station and demanded an arrest shouting, “you will support this woman!” Matovu couldn’t afford to bribe the police to convince them to take action. But what she lacked in money, she made up in sisterly tenacity. So she resolved to go to the police every day until they did something. Day after day, she arrived, until eventually, the police could no longer ignore her. Thanks to Matovu’s efforts, Nakato’s husband was arrested and sent to jail. This just goes to show that when sisters decide not to stand back, but to stand up for one another, they can achieve great things. We all know that there are many problems in the world, from girls’ education in rural Africa to urban poverty in the United States. But sometimes, the scale of the challenge can be intimidating. It can seem impossible to solve the world’s problems, so we stay focused on our immediate surroundings – our work, our friends and our family. But the truth is, just because you can’t make a big contribution doesn’t mean you can’t do anything at all. A few years ago, a friend of Honegger’s, Dee, welcomed Ugandan teenager Rachel to her home. Rachel required major brain surgery, and while a charity had organized a medical evacuation from Rwanda to a hospital in Texas, she would need a local foster family to take her in and look after her following the surgery. As a busy mom, Dee didn’t have much time or money, but she had a big heart and volunteered to help. Dee had never met Rachel before, but she spent nights by her side in the hospital. She took her home, bathed her, nursed her and was her friend and foster mother for 18 months. During this time, Honegger herself was particularly busy with work commitments, and she felt a little guilty that she couldn’t do much to help Dee. One day, while grocery shopping, Honegger realized that just because she felt unable to make a large contribution, she could still help. She loaded up her cart with groceries and goodies and dropped them off at Dee’s house. From then on, she just kept doing the same, week in, week out. This story reminds us that even if we can’t all do big, incredible deeds, such as what Dee did, there is always something we can do to help make the world a better place. So what can you do? You don’t have to turn your world upside down. Think about how you could make a small adjustment to your current life that would have an impact in the world. For example, if you are a photographer, why not help out Heart Gallery, an organization that takes and showcases compelling photo-portraits of adoptable children to help them find parents. If you are an accountant, you could choose a local charity and help it get its accounts in order. Whoever you are, whatever you do, you have the power to make a difference in our world. Use it. When Honegger’s daughter was days old, Honegger admitted that, amidst the exhausting chaos of having a newborn, she wished she could put the baby back inside her. Her doctor told Honegger to give the baby to her own mother and get some sleep. Five hours later, Honegger felt better. The challenge of motherhood was still a large one, but it felt more manageable. You can't always be available for others; eventually, you will simply burn out. It’s essential to dedicate some time to taking care of yourself, so here are some practical tips for avoiding burnout to make sure you pace yourself and take the occasional break. First up is meditation. For Honegger, meditation is simply about spending ten minutes affirming her value in front of God. She has found a mantra that she repeats to herself until she believes it saying, “In your presence, I have nothing to change, fix or prove.” So take ten minutes out of your day to affirm to yourself that you don’t need to be thinner, harder working, a better mom or anything else except what you are, right there and right then. It will help remind you of your own value. The next tip is to be present. If you, like many people, struggle to put down your phones and really connect with people around you, give your children, husband or friends permission to unplug you. When Honegger gets home, she operates phone-free until the next morning. And if she gets caught breaking the rule, her children have permission to hide her phone. To date, they’ve only forgotten where they hid it once. Finally, celebrate effort. When Honegger talks to her Noonday ambassadors on Facebook Live and asks what there is to celebrate, she’s not looking for results; she wants to hear about the new girl who pushed through her fear to lead her first sale or the teammate who made the bold decision to miss out on short-term sales in order to properly recover from an illness. Effort is worth celebrating because it’s effort that, in the long run, brings results. There’s no point in getting to where you want to go in life if, when you arrive, you aren’t in one piece. So take care of yourself. You will flourish, and you will be able to make your best possible contribution toward a continually evolving world. The key message in these blinks: Many women know, deep down, that something more fulfilling is out there. But instead of pursuing their deepest desires for a meaningful, impactful life, they stay in their places of safety and comfort. If we do find our courage and step scared but hopeful out into the world, huge opportunities await. Stop letting fear keep you on the sidelines, and embrace your courage today.  Actionable advice: Unwrap some of the bubble wrap surrounding your life.  Consider enrolling your children in a public charter school. Shop at a grocery store where you rub shoulders with people different to you. Make friends with foster families and diverse members of your community. Try to take off a little of the bubble wrap surrounding your life, and you’ll find you’ll not only learn more about the world, but you’ll also be better positioned to help make it a better place.

Sure you have. But did you ever stop to consider why you did that? Why did you give up something you wanted to make sure someone else got what they wanted? Because it felt good? Because it would give good karma? This kind of self-sacrifice might seem innocuous enough, but, as these blinks will show you, the idea of altruism, universally hailed as a moral one, is not only false, but irrational and dangerous, too. A society based on altruism can lead to totalitarianism and the loss of the only freedom that counts: the freedom of the individual. So what’s the alternative? Selfishness! Note that this does not mean the amoral, predatory behavior of criminals like Bernie Madoff, but rather leading a principled, honest and self-respecting life based on voluntary exchange, where neither party has to sacrifice themselves. These blinks explain more fully what selfishness really is and why it’s better than altruism. In these blinks, you’ll learn why discrimination is sometimes a good thing; why selfishness is more rational than altruism; and why altruism leads to a society of mindless yahoos. Does altruism pave the way to honesty and integrity? Can it bring about equality and social harmony? If you answered yes to either of those questions, you're wrong! Nearly everyone assumes that it’s moral to put others before yourself; even people who choose to behave unethically usually don't question the theoretical value of altruism. However, the real consequences of altruism are rarely investigated.  Altruism is about subordinating yourself, because it requires servitude, not benevolence. Generously helping a victim of misfortune is not enough; rather, this doctrine of self-sacrifice claims you owe an unchosen debt to which the recipient is morally entitled.  Altruism requires you to put other people's interests before your own and suggests you have no moral right to exist for your own sake. So, to be altruistic, you must be prepared to sacrifice your wealth, goals and interests. In other words, altruism effectively takes away your possessions, money, time and possibly even your life. Those things are no longer yours, as they now belong to the larger group or society. You surrender yourself for the good of the group; effectively, you're now serving those who have less.  A recent proposal regarding airline safety in the US illustrates the illogical nature of altruism. Many airlines forbid blind people from sitting in emergency rows; this policy, however, was opposed by the New York chapter of the National Federation of the Blind as discriminatory. The NFB proposed blind people be allowed to sit in the emergency rows. This proposal even turned into a Senate bill, which would endanger everyone on the plane in the name of equality – or, in other words, altruism.  In a purely altruistic view, there are only two kinds of people: those who have needs and those who can ensure that those needs are met. That's why governments constantly sap money from those who are able to provide and give it to those who aren't. Governments often subsidize transportation or farming, for instance. People accept these policies because of their altruistic nature, not because of their moral righteousness. At some point in your life, you've probably heard the argument that, in the name of public interest, it’s sometimes good to subordinate yourself. But is this true? No. The concept of public interest is a myth. Proponents of altruism argue that society benefits from personal sacrifice. But this idea is false. Why would it be in the interest of the public to build a park, but not a shopping mall? Those in favor of the park would say that a park merely requires government funding because it doesn't have an entry fee; however, someone still has to pay for it. Citizens pay for the park with their taxes even if they don't use it and would rather have the shopping mall. The concept of altruism ultimately leads us to collectivism. Modern states are founded on the Hegelian idea that the state has supreme rights. The collective nature of society becomes part of your identity, as it is from your membership in the collective group that your identity derives. And any form of collectivism ultimately makes you dependent on the society you're a part of, which effectively renders you helpless as an individual. When a member of a collective society accepts his position as nothing more than a small piece of a whole, he’s more likely to blindly follow orders. In the direst scenario, collectivism leads to totalitarianism.  States care for individuals in the same way that farmers care for their chickens or pigs. Farmers tend to the animals because the animals produce goods – ham, eggs – that benefit the farmer. You serve the same function for the state: you're a means of income. The state stands to profit by expending your labor, your time or even your life. No one can take away your thoughts, right? Wrong – if you adhere to altruism! The altruistic doctrine doesn't only control your sense of morality; it also tells you what to hold true.  A person who lives a fully selfless life no longer has her own convictions. Altruism preaches that disagreement is bad. It's not only your actions that make you a servant to the group; you have to obey with your thoughts, too.  This leads to people in an altruistic society believing what they're told. Two times two, in such societies, needn’t equal four! In fact, Hermann Goering, the founder of the Nazi Gestapo, defended Hitler's unusual economic policy by saying, “I tell you, if the Fuhrer wishes it, then two times two is five.” This can push people into believing that even their lives should be handed over to the group. Selflessness isn't merely a means to an end – it can be an end in and of itself. That's what motivates suicide bombers to sacrifice their lives. And giving yourself up can even take away your ability to love. You can't love someone unless you have your own identity, and altruism robs you of that. Altruism says that you can't think of yourself as important. Love, however, isn’t a selfless act! The concepts of selflessness and public interest will also lead societies to value the redistribution of money or other goods. This means that the best parts of society have to be watered down to match the worst. If some people aren't beautiful, no one can be beautiful. The highest goal of altruism is to achieve a complete lack of selfishness.  The greatest irony of altruism is that it doesn't even help those it purports to help. It only makes them dependent on others and conditions them to paternalism.  Even those who oppose altruism usually don't consider “selfishness” a viable alternative. Selfishness is bad, right? Well, no – selfishness is not inherently harmful or immoral. We assume this only because we misunderstand the concept itself. Selfishness has long been demonized. When you hear the term, you might think of a man cheating on his wife or a thief robbing a house – moral personifications of selfishness. That's not what selfishness really means, however.  Proponents of altruism say that selfishness, by definition, harms others. That idea was propagated by Nietzsche, who described selfishness as rude and impulsive. But selfishness isn't simply a blithe attempt to satisfy desire. After all, there are those whose sole desire is to take drugs or commit serial murders. True selfishness, in contrast, is founded on reason. Humans use reason – rationality and logic – to determine what's good for them. Animals, on the other hand, merely try to survive, satisfying each need as it arises. Being in animalistic thrall to the moment can’t properly be called selfishness. So selfishness must be a rational act. Selfishness doesn't push us to hurt others – because it’s more rational to treat them well. Trading is much better for you than robbing, because robbing someone might get you killed. Your selfish desire to not be killed would naturally motivate you to work peacefully with others. So it’s actually selfishness that motivates people to operate through voluntary exchange with others, where both parties are satisfied. If you’re selfish, you regard your individual values, ideas and life as precious. Such things should be embraced and protected, not surrendered, and you should stay loyal to yourself at all costs. Similarly, you should not demand or require that others sacrifice their own values or life for you. Even love is selfish. You form relationships with those who are important to you. It would be absurd to be with someone you don't like just because it makes them happy. While an altruist might regard such amorous martyrdom as a virtue, a selfish person would call it downright irrationality. So if you don't want to be a slave to the needs of others, selfishness is the doctrine to follow. Do you think you'll live well and prosper by giving to others and making sacrifices? Well, you won’t! Long-term happiness and survival can't be based on altruistic values. The only way to achieve those things is through selfishness. Imagine, for example, that you’re very thirsty, and someone gives you a poisonous drink. Would you still drink it to quench your thirst? Clearly not. The drink is poisonous and there’s nothing you can do about that. It isn’t some sort of logic puzzle you can reason your way out of – you have to accept that the drink is a threat. A selfish person, valuing survival, would dash the drink to the ground. There’s really no middle ground between selfishness and altruism. Selfishness is about staying fully committed to rational thinking, so there’s no way to be selectively selfish. It’s a lifestyle you need to adapt to. And don’t feel guilty about being selfish – it’s something to be proud of. Be proud that you’ve committed yourself to a belief system that’s life-affirming. Altruism, on the other hand, neglects life. If you give your kidney to a stranger, for instance, you might be preventing your own child from getting it at some point down the line, when they might need one from a close relative. So selfishness, in this case, would guarantee your family’s survival. In an altruistic view, you don’t judge people for what they really are. You show mercy to those who might not show mercy themselves. Altruism isn’t founded on fact – it’s founded on compassion, but compassion alone is neither rational nor life-affirming. Ultimately, altruism isn’t tied to your personal concerns, so it shouldn’t be a guiding principle for your life. Selfishness is the logical route. But what would a society founded on selfishness actually look like? What does the term “capitalism” make you think of? What about “freedom?” Those ideas are both based on selfishness – not altruism. Freedom is a fundamental concept, but the idea of a government that grants you freedom is incompatible with altruism. Freedom and reason are inextricably linked. That’s why the United States was founded on the idea that humans are rational beings. A society that values individuals and their rights doesn’t have room for masters or servants, so it doesn’t have room for altruism, either. Capitalism regards the rights of the individual as absolute. An individual’s property or livelihood can’t be appropriated in the name of the collective good. A free and capitalist society requires a republic, not a democratic government. The Founding Fathers envisioned a United States based on limited state rights, rather than majority rule, so as to ensure freedom. Democracy can be dangerous. After all, it allowed Hitler to come to power. No government should have as much control over its citizens as Nazi Germany once had. In a capitalist society, public transportation, parks and libraries wouldn’t be owned and controlled by the state. Such institutions would be private, ensuring that only those who want to use them have to pay for them. An altruistic society, on the other hand, would be highly unproductive and, in the worst case, it could result in slavery. In an altruistic view, all humans are interchangeable. That kind of equality is not something to be valued at all. An altruistic country makes everyone dependent on state welfare and robs them of their independent thinking. It is founded on paternalism and control, and unconcerned with productivity. Only a society that embraces selfishness can truly succeed in the world. The key message in this book: Though most people take the value of altruism for granted, it’s really a destructive doctrine that robs society of its productivity and individuals of their livelihood and critical thinking. Selfishness, on the other hand, can ensure our happiness, safety, well-being and the functionality of our state. Selfishness is not something to be ashamed of – it’s a rational mode of thought that praises reason, good will and even love. Actionable advice: Praise the players, not the team. The next time your favorite sports team secures a victory, consider the players that made it possible. You’ve probably heard the phrase, “It’s the team that wins, not the star,” but in reality, victory wouldn’t be possible without the few who have particular skills. There’s nothing immoral about giving credit where credit’s due.   Suggested further reading: The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt The Righteous Mind explores how moral decisions are made, concluding that moral judgments stem from intuitions, not logic. The author draws on his background in social psychology and 25 years of groundbreaking research to explain how morality both binds us and divides us and how religion and politics create conflicting communities of shared morality.

And that’s a shame because it’s an extremely useful tool in our personal and professional lives. Being familiar with our own feelings and being aware of how others see us is crucial to successfully navigating social situations, both at home and at work. These blinks will teach you to recognize damaging thoughts and behaviors in yourself and others. Step by step, you will learn how to deal with your emotions and how to request and receive feedback in order to make positive changes. And it’s not just about individual self-improvement. You’ll realize that self-awareness is a group activity, which will help your entire team work better together. In these blinks, you’ll find out what naming your child Luxx might say about your self-perception; how taking five minutes today can improve your entire day tomorrow; and that if your partner doesn’t pick up on romantic cues now, they probably never will. Self-awareness is one of the more remarkable features that set humans apart from animals. Some 150,000 years ago, the brain of Homo sapiens developed in a way that led our ancestors to begin examining their own behavior, thoughts and emotions. In this way, self-awareness was born. Self-awareness is defined as the ability to know oneself and be conscious of how others see us. Psychologists separate self-awareness into two categories: internal and external. Internal self-awareness is about knowing ourselves; being conscious of our likes and dislikes, our ambitions, our place in the environment and our impact on other people. External self-awareness has to do with understanding how other people see us. It’s about being able to look at ourselves from an outside perspective. Surprisingly, scientific research shows there’s hardly any relationship between internal and external self-awareness. But research has found a relationship between a person’s happiness and how self-aware they are. People who have both internal and external self-awareness are able to make better decisions, have stronger professional and personal relationships, are more successful and more creative. So how do we develop self-awareness? To be fully self-aware requires seven types of insight, the first of which involves insight into our values. Our values are the principles guiding how we live our lives. Examples of these include honesty, humility and fairness. The second and third insights are our passions and aspirations, which are concerned with discovering the things we love doing, and what our life goals are. Fit is the fourth insight. It involves understanding which environment will make us happiest, keep us engaged and enable us to thrive. Then come patterns – the consistent behaviors that make up our personality. We must understand how we think, feel and act in various situations. The sixth insight refers to our reactions – the emotional and physical behaviors we exhibit in certain circumstances. For example, our ability to control our feelings under stress. And the final insight is impact – understanding how our own behavior affects others. It’s not uncommon to encounter the kind of boss who truly believes they’re a visionary leader when everybody else in the office just sees an incompetent jerk. This is because many people are utterly delusional about their own abilities. But how does this come about? The author believes there are three inner roadblocks to self-awareness – knowledge blindness, emotional blindness and behavior blindness. Knowledge blindness occurs when you assess your competencies not on how you actually perform, but on general beliefs about how you should perform. An experiment conducted by American psychologist David Dunning demonstrates this well. Participants were asked to take a geography test. Those who thought they were generally good at geography believed they had scored particularly highly, even though, as a group, their score was average. Emotional blindness is being oblivious to your own feelings. Say somebody asks you how happy you are. You may think your answer is rational, based on an evaluation of your circumstances. But in all likelihood, how you respond will be a gut decision made in that moment. Behavior blindness is the failure to see your own behavior through the eyes of others. The author gives the example of a talk she once delivered. She thought it had been a disaster. However, it turned out that the audience loved it, proven by the fact that she had a record number of sign-ups to her monthly newsletter. And it’s not only these three obstacles that get in the way. The cult of self in our society is another barrier to self-awareness. Have you ever wondered why there’s a growing craze for novel names in America? Names like Izander, Luxx or Sharpay? These are examples of a growing cult of self, where people become convinced that they, and therefore their children, are special. It’s part of the age of esteem that we’re entering, where everybody thinks they’re unique. But be careful. You may feel special, but that doesn’t make you superior. If you behave as if you’re better than everybody else, you’ll soon find yourself the object of other people’s resentment, and you’ll find it challenging to cope with even minor mistakes you make. If we spend enough time and effort navel-gazing, we’ll eventually come to understand ourselves, right? Not necessarily. Yes, examining our thoughts, emotions and habits can lead to greater self-awareness, but the wrong type of introspection can have the opposite effect. In fact, there’s even research that shows self-analyzers have higher levels of anxiety, less positive relationships and a lower opinion of themselves. The problem is that, while we may be quick to grasp at any insights gained from self-analysis, we don’t often question their validity. So, how can we use introspection to become more self-aware? For introspection to be successful, we need to have a flexible mindset. When we accept that we may not find one definite answer, we can let our curious mind wander and explore various perspectives. Another common mistake people make is to ask themselves why they are the way they are. They look for the causes of their thought patterns and behavior. But the human brain is lazy, and often just presents us with the most convenient answer. Therefore, it’s more helpful to ask what kind of person we are. What do we feel and think and do in any given situation? The benefit of asking what rather than why is that we begin to put names to our emotions. Research shows that when we name our feelings – especially the less positive ones – we’re in a better position to recognize them, rather than letting them set off a fight-or-flight response. When it comes to positive thoughts, we should be aware of the risk of over-analyzing. When we try to rationalize our positive experiences, we’re in danger of taking the joy out of them. Lastly, watch out for introspection’s evil twin – rumination. The author defines rumination as a fixation on our anxieties, weaknesses and insecurities. Not only does this prevent us from gaining insight, it could have damaging consequences, including depression. What do you think of when you hear the word “meditation”? If you’re anything like the author, you might feel intimidated by the thought of yoga mats, incense and chanting. But it’s nothing to be scared of – for millennia meditation has helped people increase their self-awareness, and you don’t have to become a monk or make a grand lifestyle change to do it. The author suggests three alternative techniques to increase your mindfulness and, with it, your internal self-awareness. It’s easy to confuse introspection and rumination with mindfulness, but they’re opposites. Rather than analyzing and judging our thoughts, mindfulness encourages you to notice them without judgment. By taking this approach, you’ll begin to make new observations about yourself, and improve your self-awareness. You may even improve your happiness, health and productivity, as many people who practice mindfulness find. The first technique is called reframing. Reframing is all about looking at the bigger picture of your experiences. For example, if you lose your job, you might fixate on what you have lost. To reframe this experience, you would also focus on what you could gain from it. Perhaps you realize that you’d become stuck in a career rut, and that you’re now free to find new opportunities, or even start your own business. Another technique is called comparing and contrasting. It involves noticing how our thoughts, feelings and behaviors have remained the same or changed over time. It’s a mindfulness technique that the author herself has used. Two years into her second job, she began to get restless. When she thought back to how she’d felt two years into her last job, the author realized she felt the same way this time. She was then able to recognize that the problem wasn’t her current job, but an internal pattern that made her feel this way. Why not try this technique yourself? Ask yourself questions about your job and relationships – what has remained the same, and what is different from past jobs or relationships? The third mindfulness technique is the daily check-in. Take five minutes each day to reflect on what went well and what could have been better. Is there anything you can learn from your experience today that you can improve on tomorrow? If you want to know how other people think of you, and gain external self-awareness, you might think it’s as easy as asking friends and family directly. But that’s where the trouble begins – the people closest to you won’t be honest about how they see you. The author calls this the MUM Effect. It means we keep Mum about Undesirable Messages. We tend to remain silent rather than giving others information that will make them feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, we even tell white lies rather than the truth, and this is the first roadblock to self-awareness. The second roadblock is our reluctance to ask for feedback. We tend to make excuses, which fall into three categories. First, we convince ourselves we don’t need feedback. That’s plain incorrect. In fact, how other people see us is just as important when it comes to achieving self-awareness as how we view ourselves. The second excuse we make is that we shouldn’t ask for feedback because surely it’s a sign of weakness. But just think; if somebody asked you for feedback, would you see it as a sign of incompetence in that person, or would you respect their efforts to better themselves? Leaders who ask for critical feedback are seen as more effective. And the final excuse is that we don’t want feedback. We’re afraid of feeling hurt by others’ comments, and for that we need to have courage. It’s easier said than done, but once you’re aware of these barriers and you’re ready to overcome them, there are several ways to do so. One way is to ask for 360-degree feedback. As the name suggests, that means feedback from all angles. In business, this would involve asking everyone from colleagues and managers to clients and board members to fill out a feedback form. One benefit of this technique is anonymity, which allows people to be honest. On the flip side, people who are jealous or resentful may take it as an opportunity to let off steam. To get around this, ask only those who you trust to be fair and truthful. So you finally plucked up the courage to ask your colleagues for feedback. Great! Only, they say you seem over-confident. Your first instinct might be to get snarky with them, or to dismiss or deny what they’ve said, but that’s not helpful. So what is the best way to process feedback? To digest your feedback into something you can use to gain insight, you need to learn how to receive, reflect and respond to comments. This is called the 3R model. Let’s start with receiving feedback. In order to receive feedback successfully, you must first ensure that you’ve understood it correctly. If you’re unsure, ask for clarification. Ask colleagues to explain further what they mean by “over-confident,” with examples if possible. Then you can start to reflect. The following three questions can guide this process of reflection: Can I relate to this feedback? How will this feedback affect me in the long run in terms of my success and my well-being? Should I act on this feedback? You also need to consider how you might act on the feedback. Perhaps you should consult more colleagues before committing to changing your behavior, or you could choose to frame your perceived over-confidence as a strength rather than a weakness. There are two other general points to keep in mind when receiving feedback. First, when you receive harsh feedback that confirms a view you already had of yourself – that you’re a poor team player, or an ineffective leader – it’s tempting to shut down completely. To counter these feelings, try self-affirmation. Before you receive any feedback, remind yourself of your positive qualities. It might be as simple as reminding yourself that you’re a loyal friend and loving family member. Second, you should acknowledge that although it’s worth making the effort to change your behavior, there are some aspects of your personality that you cannot change. Say you’re really bad at reading other people’s emotions and intentions. Particularly if it’s something you’ve already tried to improve but you just can’t seem to do it as well as others, it’s sometimes best to accept it, be open about your weakness, and communicate it clearly so that others will understand. Self-awareness isn’t just a useful quality for an individual to possess – it can exist on a collective level, too. So how can a team of people become self-aware? Just like a self-aware individual, a self-aware team knows itself and knows how others see it. To achieve this, a team must develop five areas of insight, which the author calls the Five Cornerstones of Collective Insight. These cornerstones are objectives, progress, process, assumptions and individual contributions. Any self-aware team must regularly assess how well it’s performing in each area. By asking the right questions and examining issues from all possible angles, the team can become more efficient and effective. What sort of questions might a team ask to gain insight with these five cornerstones? Take objectives. When assessing its objectives, a team must ask itself what its most important goal is. Is it more important to increase sales, or is it more important to focus on the company’s environmental impact, for example? Assessing progress is perhaps the most straight forward. The team might ask “How many units have we sold?” or “How many new clients have we gained?” To evaluate its process, a team should focus on the way it’s currently working, and look for areas of improvement. This could involve questioning how effective the marketing strategy is, or even the format of internal meetings. As you’ve already learned, it’s just as important to be aware of how others see you, and this is no different for teams. That’s where assumptions come in. Assumptions are the judgments made about a brand by outsiders. A self-aware team will take the time to understand how its work is viewed by others, and consider how to build and improve on its image. Finally, a team can gain insight through evaluating individual contributions. This can be done by considering which team members are having the most impact. If you really want to go the extra mile when building your self-aware team, there are three more general areas to consider: role models, psychological safety nets and a culture of evaluation. Any self-aware team needs a role model. This person should be a leader who can communicate their principles clearly and, crucially, act upon those principles. Psychologists have a name for such behavior – authentic leadership. They’ve observed that when leaders are open and genuine about their own performance and how it measures against their own standards, it encourages other members of the team to be honest, too. This allows the entire team to reflect on the five cornerstones of insight truthfully. As well as good leadership, a self-aware team needs a psychological safety net. That means cultivating an atmosphere in which any member of the team feels safe asking for help. A supportive environment also encourages team members to admit failures and raise criticism without fear of negative repercussions. Finally, though following the pillars of insight will help your team gain self-awareness, it’s important to remember this is not a one-off solution. The process of being self-aware should be ongoing, and built into the team’s culture. A great example of this can be seen at computer animation company Pixar. President Ed Catmull introduced a regular “day of honesty” called Notes Day, which encourages employees to think about any issues the company might be facing with complete honesty. You don’t have to look far to find an example of a deluded individual. We’ve all seen the angry, aggressive boss who thinks his approach to leadership is the only way, or the partner completely oblivious to obvious relationship cues. The author calls these people un-self-aware, and how we deal with an un-self-aware person depends on the type of delusion they have. There are three kinds of delusional people – the Lost Cause, the Aware Don’t Care, and the Nudgable. The Lost Causes really hold onto their delusion. They have beliefs that cannot be shaken, and they cannot conceive of any opinion other than their own. As you might have guessed, these people can’t be changed. You can only minimize the negative impact they might have on our own success and happiness by realizing that the problem is theirs, not yours, and be conscious of how you react to their behavior. The Aware Don’t Care is a person who knows exactly how their behavior impacts others, but couldn’t care less. Again, the best way to deal with these people is to manage our own reactions, as any attempt to change such people is doomed to fail. The author has adopted a technique called the laugh track. Her former boss used to make cruel comments toward her. Whenever he did this, rather than cry, she would imagine a laugh track behind his words, which made the experience bearable, and sometimes even amusing. The third delusional person is the Nudgable. Finally, a person we can change – at least in a small way. Nudgables are open to other people’s opinions. The problem is that they’re totally oblivious to what those opinions are. It then falls to you to help the un-self-aware by letting them know how others see them. This enables them – and the team – to become more self-aware and successful at work and at home. The key message in these blinks: Self-awareness is the ability to know our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and understand what others think of us. It’s a vital skill in today’s professional and personal environment, but one that we often lack. This is due to both internal and external societal roadblocks. The good news? The more aware you are of these obstacles, the more easily they can be overcome.  Actionable advice: Rather than a “Meformer,” become an “Informer!” Most of us use social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. And research shows that those who use social media generally fall into one of two categories: “Meformers,” who make up about 80 percent of users and who mostly post information about themselves, and “Informers,” who comprise of about 20 percent of users, and who post information that isn’t immediately related to themselves. The issue is, if we always only post about ourselves, we aren’t engaging and connecting with others. So if you’re one of the 80 percent, try to suppress a little vanity and become an Informer. Move from self-absorption to self-awareness by posting less about yourself and more about the world around you. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Or did you have a fraught relationship with your parents? Chances are that hidden traumas in your family are to blame. Traumatic events can affect the way we feel and behave, and when they run deep, sometimes trauma requires years of therapy to resolve. But if left unresolved, traumas, just like genes, can be passed on from generation to generation. This can have far worse consequences than just suffering a parent’s sour looks over the family Christmas dinner table! How do you overcome the crippling hold of family trauma to ensure that you don’t pass on such feelings to your children? As these blinks will show you, language is the key to unlocking the past. In these blinks, you’ll also learn how the pain suffered by your great-aunt could haunt you personally today; why a few simple questions are all you need to get to the root of pain; and how repeating positive statements can rewire your brain. Many people struggle with emotional problems. Some hold irrational fears, exhibit destructive habits or feel trapped in unhealthy relationships. If you’ve ever faced problems such as these, you might think that you’re to blame, that you’re the source of your emotional turmoil. But often such unhealthy behavior stems from trauma that you instead experienced, directly or indirectly, through your family. Traumatic events, such as an early separation from a mother or an act of violence, can affect a person deeply. These events not only cause stress and fear but also can change a person’s behavior. Importantly, if a person isn’t able to resolve the symptoms of such trauma, that person might instead suppress them and as a result, develop unhealthy behavioral patterns. Worse, such people can even pass the effects of trauma to the next generation. In short, you can carry symptoms of trauma in your life that you didn’t experience. You might have recurrent feelings or exhibit behaviors that aren’t the result of any particular event in your own life. One of the author’s patients, for example, was overwhelmingly afraid of dying. She was severely claustrophobic and feared being unable to escape from a life-or-death situation. She described the feeling as “I can’t breathe, I can’t get out; I’m going to die.” The patient wasn’t reacting to trauma from her life but to the experience of her mother’s relatives, who she later learned were murdered in a gas chamber during World War II. Severe trauma like this can be so powerful that echoes of it can affect people who personally didn’t experience it. But how exactly can this be the case? Even if you don’t know much about your parents’ or grandparents’ past, the lives they lived and traumas they experienced can affect you, too. In fact, past traumas can lead to behavioral patterns that can deeply affect the family dynamic. We know that people often hide the effects of painful or traumatic events. However, it’s important that we find a way to resolve the effects of trauma. If we don’t, families can find themselves in a vicious cycle of inherited traumatic feelings. The death of a child is a traumatic event for a couple, for example. Yet if the couple refuses to deal with the reality of the situation, suppressing their painful emotions, they’ll likely project this trauma on to a second child. Our biology too can be affected by traumatic events. Research has shown that thoughts and emotions can alter a person’s genetic code, or DNA. This means that a person who suffers from trauma might pass “traumatized” genes on to children. According to Stanford University cell biologist Bruce Lipton, emotions like fear or anger can “biochemically alter the genetic expression of…offspring.” Trauma also alters stress hormones, and parents can pass on these changes to children as well. Rachel Yehuda, a researcher at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, studied Holocaust survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. She found that levels of the hormone cortisol were atypically low in the bodies of Holocaust survivors and war veterans. In general, the body increases cortisol levels following a traumatic event in an attempt to “normalize” the body’s systems. Yet people with PTSD often have chronically low levels of cortisol and, as a result, they can potentially pass this trait on to offspring. All in all, trauma doesn’t just impact one person, but potentially an entire family. So when it comes to identifying and overcoming trauma, we must examine the family, too. Even if you had a favorite teacher, a close friend or perhaps someone in your life you felt was your hero, these individuals probably don’t affect who you are and how you feel about yourself as much as your parents. Simply, parents have the strongest influence on a child’s life. Why is this the case? Your relationship with your parents shapes who you are. Your parents bring you into this world, and the life force they give you carries on afterward. There are four ways a parent-child relationship can be disrupted, called the Four Unconscious Themes. These are an overly dependent child-parent relationship; the rejection of a parent; a break in a relationship with the mother; and trauma inherited from a family member. If you suffer from trauma or emotional problems, you should examine your family history and the events of your early childhood. Doing so might help explain what’s happening in your emotional life today. There are questions to help you figure out if your experience fits one or more of the Four Unconscious Themes. If you wonder whether you experienced an interrupted bond, for instance, look to the events of your mother’s pregnancy; whether you might have been adopted; or if you were separated from your mother before you were three years old. The Core Language Approach, a therapeutic process for solving psychological problems through language, can also help uncover suppressed trauma. Core Descriptors are a key component of the Core Language Approach. You can identify them with exercises, such as describing your mother or father to learn better how you feel about them. If you say something like “My mother was abusive,” you can move to the next step, which is writing down an event you blame her for. Exercises such as these can help you pinpoint specific problems in your relationships, so you can start to address them and ultimately resolve them. It’s common to be afraid of spiders or snakes, but there are also many less common fears. And less common fears are often rooted in trauma from your past or your family’s past. We have to be particular with the language we use for describing hidden fears because we often don’t have simple words for them, especially when the fear stems from early childhood trauma or inherited trauma. Sigmund Freud wrote about repetition compulsion, or when a person unconsciously tries to bring her suppressed trauma to the surface through repetitive behavior. Our memory or even an absence of memory can alter past experiences, so it’s important to use Core Language to pinpoint the source of the trouble. One of the author’s patients felt that “The world isn’t a safe place. You have to hide who you are. People can hurt you.” Those thoughts, her Core Language, were rooted in her great aunt’s experience in the Holocaust. Her inherited trauma was controlling her. You can’t overcome your fears until you know specifically what they are. So uncover your fears by first finding your Core Complaint. Your Core Complaint is a phrase that describes your current fear or phobia, such as “I’m out of control right now and I’m afraid of what I might do.” Next, identify your Core Sentence, or the outcome that could result if your fear comes true. It might be “I’ll hurt my child” or “My partner will abandon me,” for instance. Once you’ve found your Core Complaint and Core Sentence, you can start to work on the link between your fears and your family’s history. Fears are like signposts. They direct us back through events, guiding us to the source of our pain. So how do we find these signposts and follow them down the path to better mental health? You can uncover the root of a problem by paying attention to your symptoms. Use the Core Language Approach to ask questions to help you create your Core Language Map. A Core Language Map is made up of four components: the Core Complaint, the Core Sentence, the Core Descriptors and the Core Trauma. Each component serves as a signpost, pointing to events in your family history. Those events tell us what we fear, and why we fear them. Find your Core Trauma by examining your deepest fears and anxieties as well as your relationship with your parents. The grandchild of a Holocaust survivor, for instance, felt that she was going to “vaporize” and that her body would “incinerate in seconds.” Such language indicated that the individual was affected by a deeply traumatic event in her family’s past. When she looked into her family history, she found that her Core Trauma was that her relatives were targeted for extermination as part of the Holocaust in World War II. You can use the insights you gain from your Core Language Map in two ways. The first is through Bridging Questions, or questions that use your fear as a tool to discover patterns in your family history. If a person is afraid of hurting a child, for example, a Bridging Question might be, “Did someone in your family blame themselves for hurting a child?” Or perhaps, “Did anyone in your family feel responsible for a child’s death?” The second is to create a family tree. Trace your family history back three or four generations, and place any traumatic events next to the family member who experienced them. A traumatic event might be the early death of a loved one, exclusion from the family due to a dispute or a major sociopolitical event, such as a genocide. A problem is a lot easier to solve once it’s been identified. Identifying trauma is the first step toward overcoming it. Creating new visual and verbal language that allows you to communicate with yourself is an important part of the healing process. When you recognize that a relative’s trauma is holding you back, you can work on breaking the cycle, so the trauma stops with your generation. To do so, you should use written exercises, visualizations, breathing exercises, your personal language and healing sentences. Healing sentences help you acknowledge your pain and the pain of people who suffered the original trauma. Sentences are powerful. If you repeat a negative sentence like “I’m a failure” over and over, you’ll start to believe it. Healing sentences instead work to instill positive feelings. A healing sentence might be, “Instead of reliving what happened to you, I promise to live my life fully.” Another might be, “These are not my feelings. I’ve inherited them from my family.” You can also try a healing action, such as lighting a candle in memory of someone in your family with whom you’ve become estranged. A ceremonial act could help you find a safe, emotional connection with that person, one step toward finding forgiveness or acceptance. Healing sentences can also help you heal your relationship with your parents. This relationship plays a key role in your healing process, especially if your trauma stems from early childhood. Using a healing sentence such as “I’ll take your love as you give it, not as I expect it” is helpful, even if your parents are deceased. This sentence allows you to accept and forgive your parents’ shortcomings. Coming to terms with your struggle, communicating your struggle using the right language and accepting other people’s struggles, too, are important parts of healing a relationship. The key message in this book: Don’t assume that you are the source of your trauma. Your emotional struggles might have been passed down from relatives, through genes or historical relationships.

Right? Well, not quite. Actually, everyone can become efficient learners. You don’t have to be the next Newton or have a photographic memory; all you need is a specific set of learning methods. Apply these methods and you’ll be on your way to becoming an expert in any subject. In these blinks you’ll be walked through the six steps you need to take to master the art of learning. As well as helping you enjoy the learning process, they’ll show you how to excel in areas where you usually perform poorly. You’ll also learn how you can build the desire to learn any topic, even statistics; how Craigslist can make you learn better; and what “a giant, throbbing, thirty-foot-wide buttocks” has to do with learning. For years it was assumed that learning ability was dependent on innate intelligence. But now experts have begun to show that this isn’t the case. With just a few strategies and tools, you can drastically improve your learning. The biggest finding is that, by employing learning strategies, you can dramatically improve your outcomes. In the 1980s, Anastasia Kitsantas conducted an experiment at an all-girls school. She split the girls into three teams and taught them to play darts. The members of \"Team Performance” were told that they would win by hitting the bull’s eye; those of \"Team Learning Method” were taught throwing strategies, such as keeping their arms close to their bodies; and the girls in \"Team Conventional Wisdom” were simply told to do their best. In the end, not only did \"Team Learning Method” outperform the others; its members also had the most fun! There’s another useful learning tool called self-quizzing. This learning strategy involves repeatedly recalling and testing yourself on what you’ve been taught. It’s a technique designed to help new ideas stick in your long-term memory. In fact, research has shown that self-quizzing is 50 percent more effective than some other learning strategies. A 2006 Washington University study demonstrated just this. Researchers Jeffrey Karpicke and Henry Roediger gave a text to two groups of participants. The first group read it four times. The second group only read it once, but they practiced recalling it three times over. When Karpicke and Roediger tested them all a few days later, they found that the passage had stuck significantly more in the minds of the group members who’d performed self-quizzing. A final method for improving learning is using earplugs to block out external noise. The author used this technique as an 11-year-old. He’d been having trouble focusing on his math problems, and found that judicious use of earplugs really helped him concentrate. So those are some great practical tips to get you going. Now let’s dive in a little deeper with the six steps to better learning. We've seen how effective some learning strategies can be, as well as how they can make learning more fun. But learning can be made more effective still by using the six steps of learning. The first step is all about value. If you can make the skills or knowledge you're learning valuable and meaningful, you’ll be much more driven to take initiative and persevere. Just consider the case of Jason Wolfson, an engineer in his forties. His basement is jam-packed with his artsy Lego creations. It might seem a little strange for a grown man to be tinkering with toys, but there’s a story behind each construction. The blue police phone booth was inspired by Dr Who, and his replica of Gonzo is a tribute to his wife, who’s a big fan of the Muppet character. Wolfson spent so much time and effort on these constructions because they’re truly meaningful to him. And that’s how he became a master! But meaning and significance don’t just appear out of nowhere. It takes time and a great deal of hard work to find them. For instance, few students harbor a burning passion for statistics. And so to get a group of them motivated, Chris Hulleman, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, developed a little strategy. He made the students write essays on how statistics could enhance them and their interests. They put pen to paper and came up with some real gems – for instance, that statistics could help their prospects as nurses, managers or marketers. Consequently, they quickly became much more interested in the subject. In fact, some really got the bug and ended up jumping a whole grade level. The story goes that Isaac Newton suddenly grasped the law of universal gravitation after an apple fell on his head. But you can’t rely on such eureka moments in real life. Learning breakthroughs come from setting targets. And that’s what step two is all about: breaking up larger goals into smaller goals, or targets, that you can focus on one at a time. Say you want to improve your marathon running time. Instead of just trying to run faster, target smaller and more manageable aspects of the run. Maybe you’d be better this week training on hilly terrain, for example? Not only are such smaller targets less daunting; they also make it easier to track improvement. But there’s more to mastering a skill than breaking up your goals. You also need to build up some background knowledge before you begin. That’s because it’s difficult to really grasp a new subject or field before you’ve gotten a handle on the basics. For instance, imagine you have no knowledge of German and are suddenly confronted with the question, \"Hast du heute gefrühstückt?” Without a few fundamental German words and grammar rules under your belt, you’d have no way of knowing that you were being asked whether you’d eaten breakfast. You should apply the same concept elsewhere in your life. After all, you wouldn’t start trying to fix the heating pipes without a little plumbing knowledge. And once you have the essentials down, you'll be that much better at setting yourself small and achievable goals. Have you ever practiced a presentation in front of a friend before the big day? It’s a common thing to do, and with good reason. Being evaluated by an audience is a fantastic way to improve. That’s why the third step is to develop – that is, to hone your skills by getting feedback. After all, when you’re learning, you often don’t know in what areas you need to improve. Someone else’s perspective is bound to help in the long run, even if it feels like it’s slowing you down at the time. The author actually personally benefited from this step. He’d always loved playing basketball, but he’d never been very good; in fact, he was pretty much the worst on his team. Even though he shot hoops for half an hour at his local court each day, his moves and footwork remained dismal. But that’s because his efforts were unfocused, and he wasn’t receiving any feedback. Then, one day while browsing Craigslist, he found basketball instructor Dwane Samuels. With Samuels’s help, the author worked on perfecting specific moves like the one-dribble pull-up jump shot. The trainer showed him how his middle finger should roll off the ball and how his feet should be positioned. Within a few weeks, the author’s jump shots began finding the hoop; he even started hitting three-pointers. Another way to improve is to decrease error rate by monitoring and recording your mistakes. If you’re monitoring what you do, you’ll be more aware of your performance and where you’re going wrong. In short, you’ll stop repeating mistakes. Even brain surgeons benefit from this technique. Mark Bernstein recorded every mistake that occurred in his Toronto operating room over a 10-year period. Miscommunication, a poorly positioned sponge or a delay in anesthesia: it all went in his database. Thanks to this feedback system, his team’s surgical error rate went from three mistakes a month to just one and a half. You might think that renowned writers, artists or scientists were born to succeed in their respective fields. But, in reality, geniuses are forged in the crucible of continuous learning. That’s step four in a nutshell – you’ve got to extend the knowledge you already possess. In other words, if you aspire to reach the highest echelons, you’ll have to constantly improve your understanding of a given topic. The painter Jackson Pollock knew this well. At the age of 23, he joined Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros’s workshop. Siqueiros encouraged Pollock to experiment. It was there that Pollock learned the drip-and-pour technique that brought him world renown, but it took him a long time to master it. He learned to work with fractal structures – geometric patterns that repeat on smaller and smaller scales, such as you’ll find on Romanesco broccoli or in spiral galaxies. At first, Pollock’s initial drip paintings displayed little fractal complexity. But, over time, the fractals grew increasingly complex and detailed. It fact, they were so complex that it was a physicist, Richard Taylor, not an art historian, who first spotted them. A further technique you can use for deepening your skills and knowledge is to visualize images with your mind’s eye. Stand-up comedian Bob Harris is a great fan of this method. Once he wanted to memorize the titles of E. M. Forster’s novels. So he imagined himself in a room, looking out the window, through which he could see “a giant, throbbing thirty-foot-wide buttocks.” This image ensured that Harris would forever remember the book titles A Room with a View and Howard’s End. Presumably, in Harris’s mind, the gargantuan buttocks belonged to a giant named Howard. Through the simple act of visualizing, you too can benefit and learn the concepts and facts you need in your chosen field. It’s said that the best way to master a new skill is to practice it over and over again. But the problem is that practice alone isn’t actually all that efficient. This is where step five comes in – you’ve got to relate. In other words, you have to develop an understanding of the relationship between concepts. Psychologist Charles Judd proved this in 1908 when he conducted an experiment at the University of Chicago. He had two groups of children throwing darts at a target four inches underwater. The first group simply practiced throwing darts underwater. But the second group learned about the physics of refraction beforehand. They now understood that the target’s real position wasn’t where it appeared to be, due to the way light moves underwater. Next, Judd moved the target deeper under water, to a depth of 12 inches, where refraction was more pronounced. This made conditions even more difficult as the target appeared even further away from its real position. Of course, the second group, which had a grasp on the physics, could now relate the information they’d learned to the new situation. Predictably, they outperformed the first group. Varying how you practice also works wonders for learning. A 1993 study compared two groups of women training to shoot free throws in basketball. One group practiced free throws and nothing else. The second mixed things up a bit. As well as free throws, they tried shooting from marks eight and fifteen feet away from the basket. In the end, the group which had practiced a variety of shots ended up performing much better at the free-throw line. Have you ever found yourself driving around in circles for hours, just because you’re convinced you know how to get somewhere and are unwilling to ask for directions? The sixth and final step encourages you to review your knowledge – to rethink – and thus prevent exactly this sort of mistake. Overconfidence leads to mistakes on a fairly regular basis. People usually overestimate their past performance and familiarity: they think they’ve learned more than they really have, and so expect to perform well in the future. The military even has a name for it. They call it victory disease. A general may overestimate his own abilities because he’s won many times before. There’s no better example of this than General George Armstrong Custer, the Union general who, during the Civil War, defeated the enemy time after time. But it all went wrong in 1876 at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. He led his 200 men against over 1,000 Native Americans. Only one of Custer’s men is thought to have survived. Which is all to say, reviewing your knowledge and understanding helps you to deal with overconfidence. For instance, psychologist Art Markman was convinced he knew how a toilet worked. After all, he used it several times a day and as a child he’d even opened up the cistern a few times to check the stopper and wiggle the handle. But one day he realized that he couldn’t actually describe how a toilet was constructed, and that he certainly wouldn’t be able to take it apart and put it back together again. Only after admitting his lack of knowledge could he ask himself the necessary questions: “How does the water flow into the toilet? Where does it go after flushing?” He was ready for better learning. You too can become a better learner if you abide by these six steps. No matter if you’d like to fix toilets, improve at sports or learn a language, a few simple practices will soon mean you’ll become master of your knowledge domain. The key message in this book: By putting in the effort and focusing on learning, almost everyone can become an expert or master in almost any field. But to do this you’ll need to invest the time and use some tried-and-true strategies. Just remember these six steps: value, target, develop, extend, relate and rethink. With these methods, you’ll be well on your way to better learning. Actionable advice: Space out your learning  The next time you’re studying for an important exam, make sure to split your learning into several sessions. You certainly know the frustration of spending an entire day studying only to find, just a few hours later, that you’ve already forgotten almost everything. To spare yourself this frustration and learn more efficiently, you need to break up your learning into small achievable goals and spread it out over time, instead of trying to learn everything in one sitting.

Regrets, and opportunities lost, will weigh on the rest of us. You can avoid regret by living life now. With a few simple tricks, you can become the person you’ve always wanted to be and live the life of your dreams. These blinks will show you how to create a vision for your life that empowers you and keeps you focused on your path. Importantly, you’ll learn how to deal with doubt, criticism and setbacks along the way. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: how you can improve your life through showing gratitude daily; how your life can be compared to a marathon foot race; and how an experiment with cups of rice showed the power of emotions. Ever tried finding a restaurant but ending up baffled and frustrated by too many choices, mainly because you couldn’t pinpoint exactly what you felt like eating? It’s common to feel this way about life in general. To live the life you really want, you can’t be fuzzy about your aspirations; you need a clear vision of your future. Those who can picture their future don’t need to wait to see what life deals them; they proactively create their lives in accordance with their desires. Look to Malala Yousafzai for an amazing example. Even though she was shot by Taliban members for her beliefs, she refused to give up the fight for educational rights for girls in Pakistan. Her vision of changing women’s lives for the better was too compelling for her to just stop. It’s essential that you find a clear vision for your life. To do this, think about what a perfect day would look like to you. When we think of a perfect day, relaxing images of vacation resorts might spring to mind. But what this really is about is crafting a day that contains everything that is truly important to you – things that’ll help you reach your goals. Picture a whole day, from sunup to sundown. Where are you? Who are you with? What are you doing? Are you waking up next to your partner, having breakfast with your children and then going to work at your own company? Or are you in a house next to the ocean, settling in to spend the day writing your novel? Include all your senses while imagining your day: what do you smell, hear, see and feel? This exercise not only gives you a better idea of what you truly want, but also gets you so enthused and motivated that you’ll want to start moving toward your goal immediately. Now that you have a better sense about your ideal life, let’s start taking steps to achieve it. Did you know the average American watches over five hours of television every day? This is a huge chunk of time that could be spent on more fulfilling activities. The trouble is, there seems to be a massive discrepancy between what we think is important and how we actually use our time. We tend to spend a lot of time on senseless things, like excessive TV watching and shopping, that only serve to distract us – they don’t contribute to our happiness. It’s the significant events in our life that are responsible for long-term happiness, but often they just don’t crop up in our daily thinking. Imagine your life is a house: the majestic granite terrace and the well-manicured garden (minor things) are all very lovely, but if the plumbing and electricity (major things) don’t work, it would be pretty unpleasant to live there. If you want to live fully, pay attention to the major aspects in your life. There are several primary areas to consider: Your number-one priority should be health. Health determines how you feel and the activities you can participate in and enjoy. Emotional intelligence is also essential. Well-developed emotional intelligence helps you handle what happens to you every day. Rather than being a slave to your reactions and emotions, you can start proactively guiding them. Other major areas to prioritize are family, friends, profession, finances and spirituality. Try the following exercise: rate the current state of the above aspects in your life from 0 (none or very poor) to 10 (perfect) and compare these numbers to your vision of a perfect day. Through this, you’ll discover which areas in your life need the most care and attention. If so many of us know how to eat healthily, why are obesity and diet-related illnesses increasing? It’s because there’s a difference between knowing what is right, and actually doing it. Why do we have trouble with this? When we don’t do what we know is good for us, it’s because we’re lacking intrinsic motivation. The first thing you need to do, therefore, is discover your motivations – your reasons for your actions. Take work, for example. Some of us work because we want to be able to afford a good education for our children, while others choose to migrate to another country for a more peaceful lifestyle. Recall your ideal day: who was with you and what did you do? Your answers will help you define your motivations. Once you recognize your motivations, you need to turn them into action. A great way to do this is to connect these ideas with your emotions. Emotions are central to all the decisions we make. We decide for or against something to either experience pleasure or to escape pain. Let’s say your alarm wakes you up early. The temptation to stay in bed is strong, because it’s warm and cosy. On the other hand, you remember you have an important meeting and if you’re late, it will negatively impact your job. In this situation, the desire to avoid the negative outcome is emotionally more potent, so you decide to get out of bed. The good thing is, you can use these emotional drives to guide you toward your goals. Do this by imagining how you’ll feel at the moment you reach your goals. Feel the pleasure it will give you and notice what discomfort you’ll avoid. Keep these emotions in mind as much as possible. They can be a powerful impetus for your plans. Having motivation is crucial to living your dream life. But understanding your motivation isn’t enough. Your motivations need to manifest into action. We are social beings, and interacting with others and living in line with our communities’ expectations is a basic value we all share. So it’s a given that people around us will try to influence our decisions, and will often disagree with what we choose to do with our lives. Imagine you want to take some time out from college to spend a few months volunteering in Africa. You’re so passionate about your idea that you share it with others. Then the doubts and criticism start. Your family tells you to stay and finish your education, while others suggest that it’s time to start thinking about having a family. In these moments, remember that other people’s perspectives are always going to be different than yours. People might question your plans because your ideas conflict with their own views, or because they simply are worried about what could happen to you. It’s normal to question yourself and consider a change of plans when you are faced with such reactions. Therefore, it’s essential you find ways of coping with doubt. Always bear in mind that a successful life doesn’t have a single definition. While staying in your home town and getting married at 21 might sound terrible to you, this path might make another person extremely happy. A common reaction is for others to say that you don’t have the time or ability to follow your dreams, but know that you can always find a way to learn the necessary skills. Yet commitment and persistence will play a far more important role in reaching your goals than hard skills. When you persevere, you’ll be more likely to succeed – and you can show others that you are in fact capable of achieving your goals. The author J.K. Rowling is a great example of perseverance. Desperate for money and on the brink of losing her apartment, Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish her first “Harry Potter” novel. Guess what? You’re not going to live forever. So why do you keep postponing your dreams to play out at a vague, uncertain time in the future? To avoid regrets when it comes to the end of your life’s road, you need to set your priorities while you still can. Start by striking a balance among your tasks. Too often we prioritize urgency over importance. For example, think of a father regularly missing family dinners to attend last-minute business meetings. The meetings deal with pressing matters, sure, but hardly provide long-term satisfaction. Yet the dinners, although not urgent, are essential for long-term happiness. Making the most of your life also involves being grateful for what you have. You may be the picture of health right now, for example, but this could change. Research has shown that being grateful actually improves your health: those who appreciate the good things in life every day are healthier and less likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than others who dwell on things that give them no happiness. A concrete way to organize your priorities is by writing a Live it List. Like a bucket list, it’s a list of all the things you want to do and places you want to visit in your life. There is one difference, though. Unlike a bucket list, the Live it List takes lofty goals and makes them bite-sized, easily achievable pieces. Say that your dream is to visit Barcelona. You would not only write “Barcelona” on your Live it List, but you would also write down the small steps you might take to make this trip a reality. These steps could include learning basic Spanish, renewing your passport and putting aside a specific amount of money every month. By focusing on one small step at a time, you’ll steadily move closer and closer to your goal. Now that you have a clear vision for the future and strong motivation, you’ll still need some other tools before everything can fall into place. It’s likely you’ll face moments when nothing seems to go right, and progress stalls. During these times, it’s vital you remember to think positively. It may seem somewhat absurd, but how we think about an event or a situation has been shown to affect its outcome. One famous study was carried out by researcher Masaru Emoto. He filled three cups with an equal measure of cooked rice and water, and directed different emotions to each cup for 30 days. He gave positive thoughts to the first cup, negative emotions to the second and ignored the third completely. Emoto noticed that after the period was over, the rice in the first cup had started to ferment and smelled sweetly, while the rice in the other cups had started rotting. Your thoughts function like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you stand by yourself and your dream, you can make it a reality. Staying focused isn’t always easy, though. To strengthen your positive thinking, you need to practice. One technique involves living something in your mind before you actually do it, and imagining all the details, emotions and feelings that you’ll experience once you achieve your goal. Say you’re nervous about a business meeting. Take some time the night before the meeting to mentally relax and visualize the situation in as much detail as you can. How do you enter the room and greet your colleagues? What do you say, hear and see? How do you feel once the meeting is over? This mental rehearsal enables you to practice different scenarios and helps you feel more confident when the actual situation comes about. Never underestimate the power of your thoughts. What you think can have a huge effect on your success! Now you know how thinking positively can help you get the results you want – so what’s stopping you from getting out there and living your dreams? The trouble is, many of us find it hard to shake off our negative, limiting beliefs. One exercise to pin down what you really believe is to picture your eightieth birthday. How will you feel, and what will you have accomplished by then? Whatever you see is the result of the path you’re taking right now. If you’re sluggish and weak, than this is probably your future. If you’re energetic and active, then chances are that’s how you’ll be. If you’re holding limiting beliefs about your future, it’s likely you’re doing it in your current life, too. For example, how often have you not taken action because you thought you were too old or not talented enough? To enable focused, consistent action, you need to exchange your limiting beliefs for empowering beliefs. Rather than focusing on what you think you can’t do or have, focus on what you can do! Use positive thoughts as a mantra, by telling yourself “I have done that once, I can do it again” or “I know how to do it.” These mantras hold remarkable power. Think back to President Obama’s campaign in 2008, and how his slogan, “Yes, we can” motivated and inspired people all over America. The best way to use this technique is to concentrate on one thing at a time, instead of using it for everything at once. Despite what everyone says, we’re really not made to multitask (when we work like this, we’re actually just switching quickly from one task to another). So stay focused and work on one task at a time! If you want to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the smartest thing to do would be to look up the highway to San Francisco on a map before you leave, and refer to the map during the trip. The same applies to your life. You can only achieve your goals if you have a clear, detailed roadmap of your future. Think back again to your vision of an ideal day. This time, stretch your vision from just one day to the next 20 years. Where will you be, and who is with you? What are you doing? How do you feel? Consider each of the major areas of life; your health, your finances and your relationships. To see this clearly, it’s best to break each aspect into a few subgoals. See your life’s goal as the finishing line of a marathon, and your subgoals as the milestones along the way. For each major goal, think about what steps you can take this week, this year and in the next five years to move closer to achieving the goal. If you picture living in a tropical country in 20 years, you could spend a little time this month researching which country interests you the most, and sign up for a language course perhaps later in the year. Then your goal in the next five years could be to visit the country to see if it’s really where you’d love to live. Along the way, it’s always important to measure your progress and adjust and update your vision. Think of it like an out-of-tune guitar; you don’t have to throw it away! All you need to do is change or tune the strings to make it work again. The key message in this book: With a clear vision for your future, strong motivation and an understanding of your priorities, you’ll see that what you believed to be impossible – living your ideal life – can absolutely come true. It just takes some persistence, commitment, positive thinking and a strong belief in yourself to get there. Actionable advice: Practise gratitude. Note down at least three things every day that you are thankful for. Gratitude not only helps us recognize all the good in our life and lifts our mood, but it also helps us stay physically healthy. You can find the time. There’s no excuse for why you don’t have the time to begin building your dreams; you can always carve out time somewhere in your day.  Say you need to pick your kids up from sports practise twice a week. Why not split this responsibility with another parent, so that you can grab a couple hours to work toward a personal goal? Don’t change to please others. It’s a cliche, but so many of us fall prey to constantly changing our behavior in different social contexts. In the extreme, it can cause unhappiness and anxiety when we’re pretending to be someone we’re not. Be proud of the person you are and the desires and preferences you have. Suggested further reading: Awaken The Giant Within by Anthony Robbins Awaken The Giant Within argues that, ultimately, we’re all in control of our own lives, and that by changing our habits, controlling our emotions and believing in those things we want to believe, we can make our ideal life a reality.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

And you know what? They’re right. Sadly though, many people never reach their full potential since they lack the tools to do so. Instead, they lead their lives as mere mediocre versions of who they could be. These blinks will outline how to realize your own inherent potential and become your best possible self. You’ll discover concrete tools that will help you identify your priorities, set goals in line with those priorities and then attain your goals through consistent work. In these blinks, you’ll also discover: why you shouldn’t worry about your weaknesses but rather leverage your strengths, why Walt Disney was once fired from his job at a newspaper and how Arnold Schwarzenegger succeeded in not one but four very competitive areas. You’re probably eager to start your journey to becoming your best possible self, but first, let’s take a breath and look at you. Start by identifying the core areas of your life. Look at where you are and what you’ve done thus far; and with this in mind, think about which things in life are important to you. Your core areas depend mostly on your personal preferences. They can include things such as your career, your health, your financial situation or your relationships. The main thing is that you trust your gut and be honest with yourself about what those preferences are. Don’t, for example, fool yourself into chasing ambitious career goals if you really only care about having a stable family life with lots of time for your stamp collection. Once you have your list, rate each core area from one to ten, based on how happy you are with each area right now. The ranking will show you what your priorities are, and which areas are most in need of intervention. But before you start working on them, it’s important to prioritize yourself. Today, many people are willing to bend over backwards to help others, but continuously ignore their own needs. But sadly, if you don’t make yourself a priority, no one else will either. Just as flight attendants tell you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others, you should make sure to first help yourself, so that you can thereafter properly help others. So how can you prioritize yourself? Make a list of seven actions – that take less than fifteen minutes to complete – where you make yourself a priority (i.e., reading a magazine). Over the next week, complete one action a day. Both these factors – knowing what is important to you and making yourself a priority – are key prerequisites for both personal and professional fulfillment. When you try your hand at something new and fail, how do you react? This question is explored in the book Mindset by Carol Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford University. According to Dweck, there are two distinct types of mindsets. People with a growth mindset think of life as a learning process, in which they can improve their abilities. They believe that their skills are not fixed, so they seek out new things to learn and thus grow as individuals. They say things such as, “If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.” Yet people with a fixed mindset believe they are stuck with whatever abilities they already have, and no amount of practice will change this. They say things such as, “Basketball is just not the right game for me.” Why is this important? Because people with a growth mindset are far more likely to succeed in life than those with a fixed mindset. Therefore, you to should try to actively adopt a growth mindset, by staying positive and optimistic. How? Focus on positivity, for example, with a simple exercise that encourages you to use more positive words. Set up a jar in which you place a dollar every time you say something negative, whether a word or statement, such as “I can’t“ or “Today was a disaster.“ At the end of each month, donate the money to a charity of your choice. This should help you think more positive thoughts, which in turn trigger more positive emotions. But overcoming negativity is no easy task. Psychologist Barbara Fredrickson discovered that for a person to “flourish,” or have high levels of mental well-being, that person needed to experience roughly three positive emotions to neutralize just one negative emotion. Thus you cannot simply be slightly more positive than negative – you really have to tilt the tables. We all have our weaknesses, and many of us think we should devote a lot of effort to fixing them. But in fact, it would be more productive and much less of a chore to focus on our strengths, working with what we’re already good at – for example, at work. This strength-based approach is an important prerequisite for personal excellence. This was shown through decades of research by the Gallup Organization on how people can excel and be their best every day. Gallup found that people who use their strengths daily are six times more likely to feel engaged in their jobs and three times more likely to report an excellent quality of life than people who don’t. Using your strengths regularly is also advocated by the positive psychology movement, founded in 1998 by psychologist Martin Seligman. His research indicates that people tend to be happier when they use their strengths on a regular basis, rather than focusing on fixing their weaknesses and improving what they’re not so great at. The amazing thing about using your strengths is that it can cause a virtuous cycle. The positive emotions you get from using your strengths encourage you to be creative, which in turn helps you build new skills and relationships – yet more strengths for you to use! So you might be wondering: What exactly are my strengths? Getting a comprehensive view of your strengths is important, so consider using these online tools to map them properly. The VIA Survey of Character Strengths is a free online assessment tool, with 240 questions to help you identify your top-five strengths. It can be found here: www.authentichappiness.com. Gallup uses Strengthsfinder, another assessment tool to help identify a person’s strengths. To access this tool, you need to purchase the book StrengthsFinder 2.0 by author Tom Rath for a registration code. Every mentor, life coach and self-help author says the same thing: you have to leave your comfort zone to challenge yourself and develop as an individual. But what may be surprising is that you shouldn’t stray too far. Why? Because there are three different zones of comfort to consider: The comfort zone refers to actions you are the most comfortable taking. Here, both the level of stress and mental stimulation are low. In the stretch zone, things are a little less comfortable as you feel increasingly challenged. Stress levels are still manageable, however, and actually keep you sharp and focused. As a result, you learn and grow. In the stress zone, your challenges constantly overwhelm you, and can’t do your best as you’re simply too stressed. Because you’re in survival mode, you don’t learn and soon become exhausted. So which zone do you think is the right one if you want to keep growing as an individual? You guessed it: the stretch zone. You should try to figure out exactly where your stretch zone lies and then get in there as often as possible. But how do you do this? Try scheduling your priorities: If getting in shape is a priority for you, adhere to a workout schedule. Ideally, get some friends to join you, so peer pressure will keep you from skipping workouts. But you also need to mind your stress levels. One way to do this is a simple productivity mantra: “Do it, dump it or delegate it.” If something is important, do it yourself. If not, forget about it. And finally, if someone else can do it, delegate the task. This will help you avoid taking on so much that you slide into the stress zone. If you don’t yet have clearly defined goals in life, it’s time to make them. Why? Having a goal to strive toward is good for you. Studies show that people who have a goal that is personally significant are happier than people who don’t. This is because goals motivate, give hope and once they’re reached, boost confidence as you realize: “Hey, I did it!” Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, always set extremely ambitious goals for himself, and as a result was successful in four highly competitive areas: acting, bodybuilding, politics and real estate. So how do you set goals the right way? One common approach is to set goals that are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely. For example, “Every Tuesday at 2 p.m., I am going to do thirty push-ups.” Just make sure your goals are in line with your personal priorities so that you’ll be motivated in the long run. For example, if a sense of adventure in life is a priority for you, then you could set a goal to organize every year four long hikes with your family. Once you’ve set your goals, start taking small steps toward attaining them. Why small? Because each step will be easier to complete and thus help you get started as well as build confidence. You won’t feel overwhelmed if you take it one small step at a time. The Japanese refer to this approach as “kaizen,” meaning making continuous, small improvements that have a big cumulative impact. So define the right goals and plot small, manageable steps to attain them. After all, you wouldn’t try to read a 400-page book in a single sitting. You’d probably read about twenty pages a night, and in this way, you’d be finished in under a month without once feeling overwhelmed. Once you’ve set your goals, it’s time to take action to attain them. If you want to become healthier, for example, you need to start exercising! You’ll probably quickly realize that you have lots of paths toward achieving your health goal. You could start running, hiking, biking, swimming, shooting hoops, lifting weights and so on. So how do you choose the right course of action for you? Some options have a bigger impact on your health and fitness than others, so naturally it’s important to be selective about where you invest your time and energy. To properly evaluate your options, look at the goals you’ve set and ask yourself: Would this course of action really help me reach my goals? Is there an even better way? This kind of critical examination should help you decide which action to take. Of course, whatever choice you make, it will bring some results. The only way not to get results is to sit back and do nothing. In addition to choosing the right actions, another key determinant of reaching your goals is consistency. Arnold Schwarzenegger didn’t become a world-famous bodybuilder by working out every now and then. He adhered to a consistent and rigorous workout regimen for years to achieve his goals! So how can you become consistent in your actions so that you reach your own goals? One way is to tell a friend or your partner about your goals over the next thirty days, and the specific actions you’ll take to reach them. Ask them to hold you accountable by asking for status updates and punishing you if you fail. This way their watchful eye will keep you moving forward! Nothing meaningful in life can be achieved easily. So don’t delude yourself into thinking that you can reach your goals and become your best possible self without putting in lots of hard work and overcoming a few obstacles on the way. What’s important is that you shouldn’t let a few bumps discourage you from your quest. Adversity is just an inevitable part of your journey to success. Consider Thomas Edison: He ran over 2,000 failed experiments before he succeeded and invented the light bulb. Imagine if he had given up after the first 1,000 failures! Obstacles are just a part of life, which means that success can be yours only if you have the perseverance to overcome them. So how can you do this best? By redefining your obstacles. Understand that you’re not the only person facing roadblocks – everyone encounters them, so you just have to deal with them as effectively as possible. One method is to start looking at solutions, instead of just seeing the obstacle. Whenever you encounter an obstacle, write down three possible solutions for overcoming it. For example, if your boss doesn’t give you that promotion this time, write down three things you could do better next time around. This approach prevents you from being discouraged, as while you can identify the obstacle, you’re already taking the first steps to overcoming it. The Chinese philosopher Confucius once said, “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.” He was right. Resilience – the ability to bounce back from setbacks and keep going – is a key determinant of success. Consider that even Michael Jordan was once cut from his high school basketball team, only to later become the greatest basketball player of all time. Or that Walt Disney was once fired by his newspaper editor for his supposed lack of imagination and good ideas. The importance of resilience can also be seen in a study by psychologists Emily Werner and Ruth Smith, in which for over 30 years, they followed the lives of 689 high-risk children born in Hawaii. They wanted to understand why some of them became successful despite facing challenges such as poverty, abuse, lack of parenting and alcoholism. And the result? The children who succeeded did so thanks to having built resilience. Luckily for you, resilience is a quality that can be trained and strengthened. One useful exercise is composing a list of important life lessons learned as a result of mistakes you’ve made, and then thinking about how those lessons have helped you. This will make you understand that failure is an important and beneficial part of life, and you’ll find yourself bouncing back from future failures far more quickly. But the most important way to train resilience is to invest time in building and strengthening your relationships with your community, friends and family. Research shows that people are more resilient to stress and get sick less often if they have a supportive social circle. We spend our lives juggling our time and attention among things that are important to us, such as work, family, friends and hobbies. We strive for balance, hoping that one or two areas don’t overwhelm everything else to the point of neglect. You probably know some people who are particularly adept at this balancing act. They are the ones who are always busy but still find time to help you move or meet for lunch. But others are obviously completely out of balance: they may have little going on but never manage to return a phone call. Learning to control the balance in your life is the final factor in becoming your best possible self. To achieve this control, you have three tools at your disposal. Look at the bigger picture. Understand which actions will lead to which outcomes, so that you never blindly act without considering how it will affect you in the long run. For instance, if you feel like taking on a new project at work, ask yourself, at what cost? Will this new responsibility prevent you from seeing your family, or force you to drop a hobby that’s important to you? Identify your non-negotiables. These are things in life – beliefs, commitments and values – that you’re not willing to compromise for any reason. One example could be watching every one of your daughter’s basketball games. Once you know your non-negotiables, you’ll have an easier time defining how you should balance your life. Make conscious trade-offs. There’s only 24 hours in a day, and you can’t be in three places at once, so you have to make conscious trade-offs. Do you go to your cousin’s wedding or work overtime to finish that important presentation? The right answer depends on you, but by making a proactive, conscious choice, you’re empowering yourself. The key message in this book: To become your best possible self, you need to start by looking at yourself. What’s important to you? Then it’s just a matter of setting meaningful goals and taking small steps toward them, no matter what obstacles or setbacks you encounter.

McRaven","summary":"Sometimes, the simplest of things can be the most effective. And that’s what these blinks are all about. It may seem obvious, but even something as small as making your bed in the morning – every morning – can hugely affect your quality of life. As a Navy SEAL, William H. McRaven fought in both Afghanistan and Iraq. While there, and during his years of training beforehand, he collected an impressive array of life lessons. From the necessity of accepting failure and the importance of never, ever giving up, Admiral McRaven’s advice is sure to inspire. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should never, in any situation, judge a book by its cover; what a “sugar cookie” is (and why it’s not as nice as it sounds); and how the simple act of singing saved his comrade’s military career. If you’ve ever seen a movie where young soldiers were struggling through boot camp, you may have noticed their bunk beds and how orderly and neat they’re kept. It may seem like a small and insignificant detail but a made bed can get your day started on the right foot. The author and his fellow cadets were taught the proper way to make a bed in Coronado, California, as part of the basic training for being a member of the US SEAL team. And they also learned when to make their bed: first thing after waking up. If someone failed to follow the bed-making code, they would perform the “sugar cookie” ritual, which involved diving into the Pacific Ocean and then immediately rolling in the hot sand on the beach. Now, you may be thinking, “What’s the big deal about making your bed?” Well, it may be an easy task, but accomplishing any task first thing in the morning is the best and most productive way to start your day. It gets the ball rolling, so to speak: by finishing one job, you’ll find it easier to begin checking off the other tasks on your list. And before you know it, you’ll be feeling great and productive – all thanks to making your bed. Another life lesson from the military is the importance of teammates in your life. The author learned this the hard way, after a near-fatal parachute jump. Falling through the air, McRaven was struck by another jumper’s parachute, which caused his own parachute to become entangled with his leg. The force of his parachute’s deployment broke his pelvis and tore his stomach muscles from the bone. During his months of recovery, the author came to learn how important it is to have someone to help you carry on. If not for his wife, Georgeann, McRaven would likely have succumbed to depression and self-pity. Everyone experiences a time in life when he needs the support of someone who believes in him. You can’t make it through life on your own. Were you ever surprised by someone? Perhaps you initially assumed the person was dull and boring, only to end up, later on, as great friends. The lesson here is to never make the mistake of judging someone by anything other than their heart. The opposite scenario also holds true. You might think a stranger is something they’re not, so before you place your confidence in them, ask yourself, “What do I really know about this person?” When McRaven was in college and considering his future as a Navy SEAL, he visited a recruitment center to learn more. While he was there, he noticed Tom Norris, a small, balding and frail-looking man. He looked like the exact opposite of a badass SEAL team veteran. Yet that’s exactly who Lieutenant Tom Norris was: a war hero who’d been shot in Vietnam while risking his life to save others. Norris fought through painful injuries and exhausting recovery to continue serving his country as a member of the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team. This brings us to another valuable lesson: that you shouldn’t expect life to be fair and reasonable. McRaven faced a fair amount of “sugar cookies” during his SEAL training – diving into the waves of the Pacific and then rolling around in the sand. This punishment was inflicted even if he hadn’t gone against the SEAL training rules, which could make life seem unfair and unreasonable. But after you spend enough time running around with sand rubbing against every inch of your body, you come to accept that life is unfair and that it’s futile to resist this fact. The ridiculous thing to do would be to waste time by refusing to accept life’s challenges. Instead, you need to pick yourself up and march forward. No one likes to hear the word “failure.” It’s loaded with negativity – something everyone wants to avoid. But with the right perspective, failure can be used as an advantage. Sometimes, failing is unavoidable. And though it can cause pain and suffering, that doesn’t mean we should allow it to overpower us. Instead, we can use it to make us stronger and more determined. While training with the Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL Teams, the author was part of a swim team that was constantly finishing in last place. This meant they were subject to another dreaded Navy SEAL ritual: The Circus. Legendary among SEAL members, The Circus is a strenuous endurance test that has been known to make many cadets give up and quit SEAL training. The Circus was an exhausting trial for McRaven, but it worked – improving the results of his swim team. And when it came time for the graduation test, which featured a swim that was more challenging than any they’d faced before, they ended up finishing first. Their previous failure had made them stronger than any of the other cadets. Part of learning from failure is a willingness to take chances. Because, in order to win big, you have to take big risks. While comfort has its pleasures, there’s a certain thrill in taking risks as well. And if you let your anxieties and fears control all your decisions, you won’t get very far. In 2004, McRaven was faced with a tricky situation. There was an enemy compound in Iraq that was holding three hostages and the intel was that the enemy and their captives would soon be on the move. His best chance of freeing the hostages required a risky daytime raid on the compound. Of course it wasn’t ideal. They’d be out in the daylight, and the compound was barely big enough to accommodate the three helicopters the team required. It was risky, but McRaven gave the orders to execute the mission. They had to push aside their fears of failure and death, but it was a success and the hostages were rescued. Life can throw a lot of challenges your way. You may be confronted by bullies or false friends. Or, if you’re a Navy SEAL, maybe shark-infested waters are between you and what you want to accomplish. The time may come when it feels easier to shy away rather than rise to the challenge, but this would be a mistake. Everyone has fears. You can’t let them stand in your way. Be courageous and stay determined to reach your goals. There are countless fears to overcome in order to join the ranks of the Navy SEALs. One night, McRaven and his swim partner had to swim four miles in the dark, which can be unnerving enough on it’s own. But this night, there were reports that they’d be swimming with hammerhead sharks, leopard sharks and even the most aggressive and feared of all, great white sharks. McRaven couldn’t let a fear of sharks prevent him from completing his SEAL training, however, and so he used this goal to boost his courage and continue. Courage is also what it takes to persevere in the face of tragedy and life’s grimmest moments. It’s during such moments that we need to put our best selves forward. Times of darkness are sure to befall each and every one of us at on time or another. A friend, family member or loved one may die, or you may need to fight an illness that takes every bit of your strength. Though terribly trying, these times require that you rise to the challenge. McRaven has seen far too many people die in battle. These are always the toughest and bleakest of times, but they’re also the times when he’s been most impressed with the endurance and resilience that people have shown. After a Navy Special Operator died in Iraq, his twin brother was there to stand tall and offer a shoulder to cry on for grieving friends and family. It was an inspiring thing to witness. He said he wanted to make his twin brother proud. Does this sound familiar? You’re at the end of your rope, ready to call it quits, and then you talk to a friend who offers a fresh perspective and gives you that second wind. These are moments that show how much difference one person can make. We should all strive to be someone who can instill hope in others and lead them forward in life. Even if you know very little about the Navy SEALs, you may have heard of Hell Week, a seven-day endurance test that often serves as the point where cadets either make it or call it quits. At one point, trainees have to spend a night sitting, covered in cold mud. During McRaven’s Hell Week, one of the cadets got up and walked away, ready to quit. But then one of the other men began to sing, and then a second and third joined in. Soon, they were all singing. It began with one man, but it was enough to get that cadet to turn around and rejoin the group with renewed hope. This brings us to the final lesson: Don’t give up! Life is beautiful, even in the times when it’s a painful mess. Remember, those blissful moments are impossible without the bad ones. So when times get tough, don’t feel sorry for yourself or blame others. Life is what you make of it, and it will only be as good as the effort you put into it. And if you give it nothing, you’ll only feel regret. In Afghanistan, a soldier named Adam Bates was badly wounded by a landmine. When McRaven visited him in the hospital, Bates was covered in burns; tubes ran in and out of him. Not only that, he’d lost both legs. Nevertheless, Bates used sign language to signify that he’d be all right. It’s the kind of response McRaven is so proud to see in soldiers. So often they face hardship but refuse to succumb to self-pity. A SEAL learns to never give up. And if Adam Bates can find what it takes to keep going, surely you can as well. The key message in this book: Regardless of who you are, there are valuable life lessons to be learned from a veteran of the US Navy SEALs. A SEAL is someone who’s been through the worst trials and tribulations; who’s faced their worst fears and grown stronger from doing so; who’s lost friends and witnessed acts of heroism that others can only read about. From these experiences comes a unique perspective on life and what it takes to make the most of it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Glei","summary":"Manage Your Day-To-Day is a compilation of the insights gained from 20 creative minds across various fields. In reading about these famous creatives, you will learn the tricks that they personally use to manage their time, create effective work routines and nurture their creativity. In addition, you’ll see just how easy it is to adapt these principles and techniques to your daily life. Even the simplest tweaks can make your work all the more effective, help you to be more conscientious of how you use technology and ensure that creative blocks won’t set you back. After reading these blinks, you’ll know how flossing your teeth can actually make you more productive; why you should never respond to any emails before lunchtime; and why cultivating a garden can lead to your next creative breakthrough. If you’re like most people, then the first thing you do when you get to the office is check your email. While this might seem like a good idea, starting your day with this simple task can actually reduce your overall productivity. Our bodies follow what’s called a circadian rhythm, whereby our energy levels wax and wane throughout a 24-hour period. These rhythms cause us to be more effective in the morning and we should therefore reserve that time for important or difficult tasks. When we get to work and see an inbox full of unread messages, it’s tempting to try to immediately resolve the stress of knowing that someone is waiting for our response by answering those emails. But answering emails is a simple task that doesn’t require much thought or creativity. What’s more, responding to emails or phone calls in the morning causes you to use your most effective time working on other people’s priorities. And when you finally get around to working on your own projects, you’ll find yourself fatigued and less efficient. That’s why creative coach Mark McGuinness suggests that you devise a work routine that allows you time to start your day with your own projects: make it a rule not to respond to any emails before your own creative work is done. In addition, you should make sure to take breaks and get enough sleep in order to maximize the body’s available energy. How much sleep is enough? While it’s hard to say, consider that only 2.5 percent of the population feels comfortable getting less than seven hours of sleep. So, if you’re like most, you should devise a routine that allows for at least seven hours of sleep every night, rather than relying on an extra cup of coffee. And don’t forget to also include breaks in your new work routine: studies have shown that we can maintain peak function for only about 90 minutes at a time. So make sure to pause and relax regularly so that you can recharge. Doing creative work when you aren’t feeling creative can be difficult. Unfortunately, we don’t always have the luxury of waiting until we’re in the right mood. But rather than relying on your mood, you can build a routine that facilitates creativity, no matter how you feel that day. Essentially, if you work regularly, then you will get regular inspiration. When working on creative projects, many people feel that they can’t work every day because they don’t have enough inspiration. But this simply isn’t true! In fact, as outlined by author Gretchen Rubin, working every day on creative projects – even if it’s only for half an hour – can help you develop many fresh ideas. By making it a habit to work every day, you bring the project into your daily life, and allow yourself to find inspiration even in completely unrelated situations. Indeed, ideas can pop up when you least expect it. For example, you might finally find a great color scheme for your project, but only after your friend showed you her brand new neon-green sneakers. Because the project was always on your mind, you found inspiration in an unexpected place. What’s more, working regularly will greatly reduce the pressure that comes with creative work. Of course, there will always be days when you feel like you can’t get anything done. However, working every day prevents the worry. For example, imagine you’re a journalist and have a deadline to finish your piece. If you start early enough and then continue to work every day, then you will have plenty of time to try out different approaches in order to find the best angle. Even when the inevitable hurdles come up, like when a source takes too long to respond or an editor rejects your draft, you’ll be less stressed, because you’ll know you have enough time still to complete it. But even working every day can’t help you too much if you are too distracted to get anything done! Our following blinks will show you how to focus in spite of the inevitable distractions. Admit it: like most people, you struggle with focusing on boring or unpleasant tasks. Unfortunately, we can’t ignore those tasks simply because we don’t like them. Luckily, author, lecturer and productivity consultant Erin Rooney Doland has two great tips to help us work through those trudging tasks. First, find ways to strengthen your will power at work by training it in other areas of your life. If you work in a chaotic environment, like a crowded office, then you know how distracting it can be: it’s so tempting to take a quick break to chat with a colleague or focus your attention on things that aren’t work-related, like a Facebook message from a friend. But if you want to get anything done, you’ll need to exert control over yourself and maintain focus. If you find it difficult to do this at work, then you can practice exerting control in other situations. If you make it a habit, for instance, to floss your teeth every night, you will not only delight your dentist but also integrate a habit of self-control into your life, even when the task is boring and time-consuming. Put simply, adopting even small routines such as regular flossing can help you avoid the distractions of the workplace. Second, you can replace any non-work related negative distractions with positive ones and then reward yourself when you’re successful in doing so. Consider this study, in which children sitting alone in a room with a tasty marshmallow were given two options: eat the sweet treat right now or wait a few minutes and get two. The children’s reactions were then observed as they struggled to resist the temptation. Those who were able to wait had replaced a negative distraction, the delicious marshmallows, with  positive distractions, such as singing. In other words, they focused their attention on something other than the marshmallow. You too can use this principle to overcome negative distractions, allowing Facebook messages and water cooler chats to be a reward for hard work. If you’ve ever tried getting serious work done while watching your favorite TV show, then you must have realized how inefficient that style of work is. But why is that? In essence, we’re just not very good at multitasking. Despite this, according to psychologist Dr. Christian Jarrett, most of us believe that we’re quite adept at doing two things at once. However, we are only able to do so successfully when one of the tasks is simple and automatic, such as walking. When both tasks require our attention, then we switch our attention from one to the other, which is both time consuming and ineffective. For example, while we can walk and talk simultaneously, we can’t talk and read. This was verified in a study that showed that, when students tried to read a book while texting with a friend, it took them about 25 percent more time to read one page than students who focused completely on the reading task. So, the next time you want to try and juggle more than one task at a time, keep in mind that it won’t actually make you more productive. Quite the contrary: your work will be even less effective. To avoid this dilemma, make sure to set aside time in your day that is completely free of distractions so that you can effectively complete your work. But even if you are absolutely determined to focus only on a single task, surely other people will want you to do something. So what can you do about that? Professor Cal Newport has a great answer: set up a focus-meeting. If you need two hours to complete a task, mark it on your calendar just like you would any other meeting or appointment, and treat it the same way. This way both you and especially your colleagues know that you are unavailable during that time and you can focus solely on the project at hand. Nevertheless, the more technology becomes a part of our work, the more distracted we find ourselves! Our following blinks detail the ways in which we can manage the technology that we both need and need to control. Think about the last time you checked your phone: do you know the exact reason why you did it? Most people don’t – they absentmindedly pick up their smartphones, surf the web and check Facebook for no particular reason, and this is especially true for social media. One good way to prevent yourself from becoming absorbed in technology is to consciously think about why you’re using social media every time you use it. We tend to habitually log onto social media whenever we’re bored, looking for a distraction. The problem with this is that we never know when it’s time to stop and move on to something else. To combat this, Lori Deschene, founder of the blog tinybuddha.com, suggests that logging onto social media should always be intentional. You don’t have to ban social media entirely! Instead, you should use it meaningfully, by being fully aware of your intentions. Sure, you can log on to share the location of the restaurant where you’ve just had some amazing pizza, but just make sure to log out afterwards. This way you can continue with your real life instead of getting absorbed with what’s happening on Facebook. Parallel to this, you should consciously think about how you’re on the computer, including your posture! For many of us, going to work entails sitting in front of a computer screen all day long. But as former senior high technology executive Linda Stone observed from an alarming study, our behavior in front of the computer or smartphone screen can be highly detrimental to our health. For instance, when gazing into a computer screen, we unconsciously hold our breath or breathe in a shallow, unnatural way, which in turn contributes to stress-related diseases. One way that we can combat this, and be more mindful of how we use technology in general, is to practice yoga and other conscious breathing techniques. Smartphones, laptops, etc., were invented to make our lives easier and more pleasant, yet, it sometimes feels like we live in a science fiction movie, totally at the mercy the technologies that we ourselves create! While your smartphone doesn’t control your body, it nevertheless controls your behavior, since you just can’t live without it! You must remember that you don’t need your smartphone in every part of your life. Smartphones are so conveniently sized that it’s easy to take them with us everywhere – all you need is a pocket to keep yourself connected at all times. Author and filmmaker James Victore rightly asks whether this is really necessary. Consider, for example, how taking a phone call at dinner used to be a serious social faux pas. Today, however, it’s a completely normal occurrence. But are we okay with trading our good manners for excessive smartphone use? Just do yourself a favor and put your phone on airplane mode the next time you’re out on a date. The thing is, we can’t resist using technology if it’s available. If you want to be more effective, you’ll have to turn it off! Having a smartphone or a computer screen right next to us when we’re trying to focus is like sitting next to a plate of delicious cookies when we’re on a diet. In other words, it’s hard to resist. Unfortunately, this also means that people expect us to be available at all hours of the day, no matter what. This expectation is such a problem that Professor of Psychology Dan Ariely even suggests that the IT team at your company delays the delivery of email until a certain time of the day, as to prevent you from being constantly bombarded. While a company-wide process such as Ariely’s suggestion may not happen, you could just turn off all your devices or even just go to another room when you really need to focus. So far, we’ve mostly focused on preventing distractions so that you can maximize your available creativity. These final blinks deal with boosting your creative resources. What do you usually do when you have a bit of spare time? Likely, you don’t spend it sitting around doing nothing, right? But you ought to! Having time in which you “do nothing” is essential for becoming and staying creative – especially if you’re stuck with a creative block. Whenever you’re stuck on something, being alone and letting your mind wander can bring back your creativity. This feels quite counterintuitive, but it’s true: if you think about nothing in particular, you will necessarily become more aware of your thoughts and surroundings, which then provide a great source for creativity. Scott Belsky, the Vice President of Adobe, suggests that you set aside a certain time in your day to simply let your mind wander without focusing on anything in particular. If this feels difficult to you, then start by thinking about what you’ve learned and what your immediate plans are and then let your mind wander from there. In addition, striving for perfection can also lead to creative blocks. Indeed, some of us are never happy with our accomplishments unless they embody perfection – but honestly, this rarely ever happens. We should all take the advice of author Elizabeth Grace Saunders: stop being a perfectionist and let creativity be your guide! If you’re a perfectionist, then you surely know how difficult it is just to start a project, waiting impatiently until that ideal moment when you’ll get the most amazing ideas. But if that moment doesn’t arrive, you’ll have to start anyway, and then you’ll feel uncomfortable and even less creative. A far better approach is to start your projects immediately, even if you don’t feel like it. This way, you’ll have something to start with and improve upon later. Even if you don’t feel creative right at the beginning, you’ll soon see your creativity kick in. Surely you know how difficult it can be when you have to come up with creative ideas under pressure. As we’ve seen before, creativity isn’t something that you can just will into motion. Luckily, there are things you can do outside of work to boost your creativity: For example, if you take time to exercise and get a good rest, you’ll find that you are more creative afterwards. As we’ve already learned, rest and sleep are important ingredients for a productive lifestyle. By the same token, they are also essential for generating creative ideas. In fact, researchers at Harvard University found that people who got adequate sleep were 33 percent more likely to come up with connections between different ideas – in other words, they were more creative. In addition to proper rest, bike rides or other kinds of exercise were shown to boost brain activity and therefore creativity as well. Business coach Scott McDowell even advises his clients to take a nap or a brisk walk in order to get those creative juices flowing. In addition, feel free to flex your creative muscles in seemingly frivolous ways – you’ll often find that these creations can be the inspiration for amazing creative work. For example, when author Julia Cameron starts a new book, she writes a few pages of complete gibberish – just to get in the rhythm of writing. She might even find some inspiration hidden in the nonsense! Hobbies, too, are a good way to find unexpected inspiration. The founder of Accidental Creative Todd Henry suggests that people garden in their spare time and be experimental with it. Having the freedom to creatively cultivate your garden lets you create and experiment in an environment without pressure. Not only that, but hobbies like this will ensure that you won’t get bogged down by the daily grind and might even provide you with fresh ideas that you could use at work. The key message in this book: By paying attention to our natural rhythms, we can maximize our energy on our priorities and rest, exercise or do other hobbies when it’s in tune with our rhythm. Sometimes, despite what we feel like doing, we just need to focus to complete certain tasks we don’t feel like doing.

There is, in fact, no natural link between inborn talent and the mastery of a skill or field. As one study showed, while many young children display blazing talent, relatively few of them ever go on to remarkable achievement. On the other hand, those who show little sign of brilliance in school often later accomplish far more than their gifted peers. For example, consider Charles Darwin’s younger cousin, Sir Francis Galton. Whereas Darwin was an ordinary boy who showed no sign of exceptional intellect, Galton had a higher IQ and was considered a prodigious genius. Yet today, it’s Darwin who’s regarded as the superior scientist and one of the century’s brightest minds. Clearly, mastery does not depend on whether you’re gifted or “ordinary.” So what steps do both a maverick genius and a regular person take to become masters?  The answer is: exactly those steps taken by every great master throughout history. Each discovered their field, engaged in some kind of apprenticeship, developed a creative and open mind, then went on to achieve mastery. Edison, Mozart, Einstein, Goethe – the most celebrated masters throughout history all followed a similar path to success. Modern masters, too, take the same steps. For example, professional boxer Freddie Roach dreamed of becoming a boxer, apprenticed with the great trainer Eddie Futch, and created a unique fighting style. Roach is now considered one of the best boxing trainers of his generation. You don’t need inherited gifts, early talent or a high IQ to become a master. Just find your field or subject and follow the steps of the great masters before you. Have you ever had the feeling that a discipline or field was tailor-made just for you, and that working in that field is your destiny? You need to trust that feeling! Each of us is unique – an original, through and through. Due to the endless possible combinations of DNA in our bodies, we are a one-off phenomenon; like snowflakes, no two humans are exactly alike. So why is it, then, that we don’t all act unique? Due to incredible social pressure to blend in, we suppress our uniqueness in the vain hope that just doing what everyone else does will keep us out of trouble. While adopting this “disguise” might have its advantages, it’s actually our uniqueness as individuals which spurs us to find our inner calling. In fact, many of history’s geniuses experienced a moment of clarity when everything “clicked into place” and they suddenly knew what they wanted to do in their life. Many of them felt that, during their entire lives, a force had guided them towards a certain field. For Leonardo Da Vinci, this “clicking moment” was when he stole sheets of paper from his father’s office so that he could indulge his deep fascination and sketch animals in the forest. And for others, such moments are even experienced in the form of an “inner voice” – as is the case with profoundly religious Christians who reported hearing the voice of God telling them to use their lives to pursue a specific task. Rather than using your energy to blend in with the crowd, recognise instead that you’re unique, and that you have a specific calling in life which can be found quite simply by listening to – and following – your inner voice. In the next blinks you’ll find out exactly how you can follow that inner voice. When people look for a “way in” to a particular field – an internship or first job – they often search for positions which promise the greatest prestige or financial reward. But there are other, more important rewards to consider. For one, a job that gives you an opportunity to learn can be worth doing, even if it doesn’t pay well. Other more prestigious, well-paid positions will be available to you later, and the practical knowledge you gain from those early, badly-paid jobs will ultimately pay off for decades to come. Consider boxer Freddie Roach: he chose to take an unpaid position at a boxing center, using his time there to develop the skills necessary to his professional career. Ultimately, his decision paid off; Roach eventually earned far more money than if he’d taken a different, paid job early on. Many other masters made a similar choice in their early years. For example, in his youth, Charles Darwin rejected both a place at medical school and a well-paid job in the church. Instead, he convinced his father to allow him to work as an unpaid naturalist on the HMS Beagle, where he could study exotic plants and animals. The observations he made during that voyage helped him to develop his famous theory of evolution. Or consider Benjamin Franklin, who – rather than taking over his father’s lucrative candle-making business – chose to work at a printing business. This meant a far longer apprenticeship, and financial uncertainty, but Franklin recognised he could use this position to learn how texts were composed – a skill that would later benefit him greatly. So when you’re looking for an internship or that first job, don’t fixate on prestige or money. Instead, sniff out those that offer you an opportunity to gain knowledge and develop your skills. Such jobs will lead you to reap greater financial rewards in the future. Learning new things is never easy. You can, however, at least make the process much easier for yourself. When we try to learn something new on our own, we tend to make preventable mistakes, and spend much time seeking the correct way to do things. The result? Time and resources are squandered. What you need is a mentor: someone to guide you, helping you to use your time and resources more effectively. For instance, consider how complicated it can be to begin a new job and navigate its working environment. Without proper guidance, it’ll take much longer for the newcomer to learn the ropes and find her way around. It’s somewhat like being in a foreign city for the first time and trying to find the train station. You can, of course, do so by wandering through the unfamiliar streets until you happen to stumble upon it. Yet, you’ll save time and effort by simply asking one of the locals. But you’re not the only one who benefits from having a mentor. Usually, a mentor and apprentice develop a special relationship from which both can profit. This is because, firstly, the mentor sees the apprentice as a younger version of herself, and is therefore interested and invested in their future. Secondly, because the apprentice admires the mentor, she pays much closer attention, absorbing their knowledge like a sponge. Yet, as an apprentice, your progress isn’t necessarily limited by your mentor’s own limitations. Many famous masters had mentors whom they eventually surpassed. Alexander the Great, for example, learned much about governing a state from the great philosopher Aristotle, and would later go on to modify and augment these lessons based on his own firsthand experiences. Like many other famous students and apprentices, you should seek out a mentor who will teach you their own ways. But don’t forget: your ultimate goal should be to outmatch your mentor. In the next blinks, you’ll find out how, following your apprenticeship, you can advance to find your own unique way forward. During your apprenticeship, you’ve learned the most important aspects and facets of your field. But you can’t stay an apprentice forever. So, what now? It’s time to revive your innately fearless and open mind. As children, all of us were natural freethinkers and rule-breakers. A child’s mind is totally open. They believe that anything and everything is possible, take nothing for granted, and thus ask all kinds of questions: Why is the sky blue? Who’s that in the mirror, staring right back at me? Children also believe in all manner of supernatural creatures and fantastical tales, and are able to imagine, with zero effort, that they’re true. Such open-mindedness, such absence of fear towards questioning anything we don’t understand – this is a human being’s natural state. For example, when, as adults, we visit a foreign country where we can’t depend on old habits and experiences, we’re prompted to be open-minded again. Seeing the world with child’s eyes is, for adults, one of the most enjoyable things about traveling. It’s precisely this freedom and audacity to break rules and subvert expectations which you should embrace once you finish your apprenticeship and go it alone. This is what will enable you to grow in your field – and achieve mastery – in your own unique way. Indeed, many masters throughout history eventually began to think innovatively and create something uniquely their own. For example, Mozart became tired of performing the old tried-and-true piano repertoire, so began to compose his own music. He fused the styles he already knew, adding some of his own, unusual elements. The result? His audiences were impressed by his music’s novelty and originality. So be brave and think in new ways, challenging the established rules of your time. If you don’t, you might one day find yourself stuck in the same unsatisfying routines. Who among us has not wished for the ability to solve problems in original and creative ways? Well, luckily, this ability can be trained. First, we must unshackle and broaden our minds, because we have a natural tendency to think too narrowly. Humans quickly become creatures of habit, loyally repeating the same actions without reflection. Once a process has been proven to work in a particular situation, we tend to use it for every similar situation without pausing to ask: “Is this really the best way to solve this particular problem?” Similarly, the standards and conventions our culture depends on might be essential for quick, functional communication, but they can also seriously hinder our potential for creative, innovative thinking. For example, in order to identify things quickly, we use clear, binary distinctions – man/woman, body/mind, fiction/fact. As we become habituated to using them, we also become desensitized to the nuances that lie between. The second thing we must do to improve our creative thinking is to train our brains to quickly make new and uncommon connections. One famous study showed that after 10,000 hours of practice in a given field, the brain is qualitatively changed, and makes brand new connections between formerly unconnected areas. This enables you to quickly see any given problem in that field in a new and broader way. This is best demonstrated in the human ability to solve a specific problem while apparently thinking about something completely different. Ever had a eureka moment while in the shower, or taking a walk? You’re in good company: Einstein, for example, played the violin while he pondered theoretical problems, claiming that this helped lead him to the solution. So don’t resign yourself to the notion that people are either born creative thinkers or not. You can control and train your brain. By following the above steps, a more open and creative mind can be achieved much faster than you might believe. Finally, in the next blink, you will learn what exactly “mastery” is. So, what exactly is mastery? You might’ve experienced it already in high-pressure situations when your body responded immediately – and automatically – to your mind’s commands. This enables masters to see the big picture, rather than just the details, and indeed many masters have described their talent in these terms. Chess master Bobby Fischer, for example, saw beyond the individual moves of a game, instead perceiving moving “fields of forces” that revealed the many ways a game could play out. Similarly, pianist Glenn Gould “saw” the entire architecture of a given piece of music as he played, not only the part he was playing at that moment. This freed him to masterfully coordinate the different parts of a composition as he performed. Masters can do this because they’ve developed an automatic connection between mind and body – a connection that is actually deeply rooted in our nature. In fact, for every animal, mental decisions and physical actions are experienced as one. For example, in the exact moment a bee “decides” to sting you, it acts on it. The bee simply reacts to sensory input, its nerves issuing a command to the body. No second-guessing the reflex; no abstract thinking. And, according to one theory, our primal ancestors didn’t separate mind and body either. Separation occurred once we’d developed the capacity for abstract thought. This is what enabled us to suppress certain reflexes. For example, when threatened, humans don’t automatically attack or run away; they try to talk things out. But this separation also meant that any sense of a unified mind and body was lost. As a master, your mind and body will become one, enabling you to reach a new level of understanding and skill. And even when you’re in the thick of practicing your discipline, you’ll also be able to see the bigger picture, and to use this knowledge to accomplish great things in your field. The main message of this book: To achieve mastery, you need to find your own, unique inner calling; study and learn a great deal under a mentor during an apprenticeship; and, finally, develop an independent and creative way of thinking. Studying the lives of other great masters can give valuable insight on this task. This book in blinks answered the following questions: Who can achieve mastery? You don’t need inborn talent to become a master; just follow the steps of masters before you. Each of us has an inner calling which guides us towards our vocation in life – a discipline or field that we wish to master. What constitutes a good apprenticeship? Your main goal in a new field should not be immediate success or money, but to learn as much as possible. The best way to learn a discipline or skill is to have a mentor who shows you the way. How can masterful, creative thinking be achieved? Once you complete your apprenticeship, you must be bold enough to think innovatively and challenge the very rules you learned before. You can learn to problem-solve in new and creative ways by broadening and training your mind. What exactly is Mastery? Mastery: practice a skill until it's automatic, so your mind and body act as one, freeing you to focus on the bigger picture.

This is where the concept of mastery becomes especially relevant. True mastery isn’t just about reaching goals; it’s just as much about internalizing a philosophy that will keep you learning even after you’ve reached your goals. In short, true mastery is a lifelong journey. But what constitutes true mastery? How can you find it in yourself and what can you do to make sure you stay on your path, even when the going gets tough? That’s what these blinks are all about. In these blinks, you’ll learn why goals, prizes and recognition are overrated; what made John Wooden such a great basketball coach; and which ritual surgeons perform before every operation. Most of the time, we take on new activities with a singular aim – to master them. Be it tennis, chess or a new job, new pursuits can go from exciting to frustrating once we reach the point where our lack of talent seems to be staring us in the face. It’s tempting to give up, but you shouldn’t; you might still have a shot at mastery if you change the way you think. The first step here is to rethink your motivations for learning a new skill. Many of us are seeking simple recognition from others and the gratification that comes with it. But if you practice tennis until you can do a handful of impressive shots, beat a few of your friends and be congratulated by spectators, you’ll only have the motivation to improve up to a point. Once you’ve reached a level of skill that’s sufficient to earn you a bit of recognition, you’ll find yourself stuck in your comfort zone. Attempting new shots or competing against more challenging opponents becomes daunting, as you fear you won’t look as good while playing. A true master develops her talents by pushing forward for the sake of it, rather than chasing praise and encouragement. Another key to mastery is your approach to learning itself, namely by cultivating a certain respect for the process. If you want to master tennis, you’ve got to accept that it’ll take time, patience and perseverance to perfect your forehand. Learning isn’t something you do for a while until you’re good enough – it’s an ongoing journey. By shifting your mindset, you’ll find that you’re capable of mastering whatever you set your mind to. After all, you were a baby once! Babies enter the world incredibly vulnerable, with very few of the skills adults need to survive. And yet, they learn at their own pace to crawl, walk, communicate, understand and think for themselves. Some infants learn to walk between nine and ten months of age, while others don’t master it until much later. Children are capable of learning motor skills despite their lack of physique and often slow learning speed. In this way, learning isn’t about how fast you acquire new skills or how talented or fit you are when you start out; rather, it has much more to do with the journey you take along the way. So, the student who shows the most promise during the first few tennis lessons might not be the one who excels, while an initially clumsier player with a mastery mindset is far more likely to go on to be a pro. But while a mastery mindset offers us a clear path to excellence, our society seems to reject it at every turn. Find out more in the next blink. American society, like most Western societies, seems to be waging war upon mindful mastery. We’re bombarded with slogans like “Get fit in two weeks!” or “Hit the jackpot!” as advertisers try to convince us that buying their products will allow us to “master” something instantly. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Mastery is built on long periods of practice without tangible results, which lead to bursts of improvement, which then give way to steady, deliberate practice once again. The journey toward mastery isn’t shaped like a steep incline, but rather a series of plateaus punctuated by spurts of progress. Learning to love these plateaus is essential to achieving mastery. When the author first began attending an Aikido school, he soon began to enjoy the ritual of classes and the seemingly endless repetition of exercises. While his classmates dropped out, he stuck around through the plateaus and worked his way toward mastery. Why do many of us find these plateaus so hard to bear? Well, typically because we’re one of three personality types that struggle with mastery – dabblers, obsessives and hackers. Which one are you? Dabblers tend to approach new hobbies with a lot of enthusiasm. They might pick up an expensive tennis racket, dress like their favorite pro and pat themselves on the back after their first improvements. But they aren’t able to handle the plateaus and end up dropping out, justifying their decision with excuses along the lines of “It just wasn’t the right sport for me . . .” The obsessive is determined to master his forehand in just one tennis lesson. The learning journey doesn’t matter to him, it’s results that matter. Most of the time, the plateaus after the first small spurts of progress will discourage obsessives enough for them to quit. Finally, hackers are perfectly comfortable spending the rest of their time in the plateau. They’re happy just to hit the tennis ball over the net a few times when playing against a superior opponent, and aren’t particularly motivated to push themselves to improve any further. If, to your dismay, you’ve identified yourself as a dabbler, obsessive or hacker, don’t fret! Recognizing the behaviors that prevent you from mastering the skills you’ve always wanted to have is the first step to overcoming them. So what’s the next step? Instruction and practice are two of the five key elements of achieving mastery. In this blink, we’ll find out just how important they both are. Of course, there are many skills you can teach yourself without too much help. But on the road to mastery, finding great instruction is a must. Instruction can come in many forms, from video tutorials, computer programs, real-life experiences or even a good old-fashioned book. They’re all valid, but social contact is particularly crucial to great learning experiences. For this reason, one-on-one or group instruction is definitely worth pursuing. But how can you know if your instructor is worth sticking with? The best way is to observe how they treat their students. Take UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, otherwise known as the “Wizard of Westwood” and one of the best basketball mentors in history. Wooden’s respect for his players is what made his coaching stand out, as did his balanced focus on the team’s strengths and weaknesses. He would split training sessions fifty-fifty between correcting problems and reinforcing what the team already did well. Practice, like instruction, is vital in your journey to mastery – but not practice as you know it. While most of us think of practice as repeating a task until we’re good at it, mastery requires us to think of practice as more than a simple action. Instead, think of practice as a noun, as a synonym for “path” or “journey.” To illustrate this, consider why a martial arts master would continue to train even after receiving his black belt, the highest qualification. The answer is simple: the black belt is just another milestone along the journey, and a license to continue practicing for as long as you wish. Here, the black belt doesn’t represent practice as the act of repetition, but the notion of practice as a noun that captures the joy of ongoing learning. Now that we’ve explored the roles of instruction and practice in mastery, let’s explore three more key elements that’ll help you on your way to excellence: surrender, intentionality and edge control. These terms are a little less familiar than instruction and practice, so let’s take a closer look. What does surrender have to do with mastery? Well, it refers to the need to surrender to your teacher and the demands of your discipline. Sometimes this means sacrificing your pride, too. Say your top-notch tennis instructor, who you respect and trust, asks you to stand on one foot and hold the other foot against your back with one hand, while your other hand rotates in the air above your head. You’ll have to do this for five minutes at the start of every class for your entire first month. You could, of course, refuse and complain that you’d look ridiculous. But by doing so, you’ll miss out on what the exercise teaches you – improved balance, for instance. Though your instructor might sometimes ask you to do things that you don’t understand, if you trust their wisdom and want to benefit from it, you’ll need to put your pride aside and surrender to them. Let’s turn now to intentionality. This element focuses on the power of the mind in mastery. Intentionality is the ability to visualize yourself succeeding, and is a technique that golf professionals, for example, rely on heavily. Take international golf legend Jack Nicklaus; he believes that a successful shot consists of 50 percent visualization, 40 percent set-up and just 10 percent swing! Finally, edges are those moments when you’re confronted with a challenge and, therefore, the opportunity to exceed your own expectations. Masters recognize an edge as a chance to grow, and they’ll concentrate their efforts to make sure they make the most of it. How do you know when you’re facing an edge? It’s a pretty familiar feeling. For dabblers, the plateau is an edge. For the obsessive, it’s their inability to understand their own limits, while hackers rarely stay on a path long enough to reach an edge in the first place. The next time you feel you’re facing a task that you simply can’t complete, you’ll need to choose between giving up or focusing hard to overcoming the obstacle. The master will always choose the latter. Say you decide to follow the path of the master. You’ve told your friends, have gotten into the rhythm of practice and feel great. But then, all of a sudden, it happens: a backslide. Let’s imagine, for instance, that you’ve decided to run five kilometers every morning as part of your practice routine. But after a little while, beyond the first successful mornings, breathing becomes difficult and your heart races like never before. This is your body sending you a clear signal – you’ve pushed yourself too far out of your regular state and your body can no longer keep homeostasis going. Homeostasis is a process by which organisms regulate their internal systems, ensuring they function in balanced conditions and avoid drastic changes. Despite all the well-intentioned resolutions you made, your body wins and interrupts your practice. This will happen for almost anyone learning a new physical skill. So how can you prevent your resolutions from falling apart? Well, there are three steps you can take. The first is to surround yourself with people who have already made it through the same challenges you are currently facing. They’ll understand exactly what’s going on when you push up against your body’s natural limits, and can offer advice on how to overcome these limits in your practice sessions. The next step to take is to ensure you have the right approach to your goals. Remember how our desire for instant success and recognition is counterproductive to mastery? The master finds joy in practice itself, and that should be your focus too. In other words, if you reach the top of the mountain, keep on climbing! Finally, work hard to stay consistent in your practice and learning. You can even make routines more engaging by turning them into rituals that give you time to reflect on the task at hand. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi observed that this is what master surgeons do when they wash their hands the exact same way prior to every operation – they create a ritual for themselves to focus their minds more deeply. The last thing you’ll need to ensure a successful journey toward mastery is energy to sustain yourself. The author considers humans to be rather like machines full of energy. Unfortunately, troublesome behavior and social mores prevent us from using this energy to its full potential. This inhibition of natural human energy begins when we’re kids. Think of how curious young children are – they won’t rest until they’ve explored and experienced everything for themselves. But parents, keen to ensure their children’s safety, quickly limit this exploration with rules; from “Don’t touch that!” to “Be quiet!” to “Not until you eat your vegetables”, we grow up listening to negative commands that curtail our natural curiosity and drain our energy. Luckily, we’re all capable of reclaiming this childlike energy through a few simple practices. One of these is maintaining physical fitness. By making sure we walk or cycle instead of driving, for instance, we can remind ourselves of the strength our bodies possess and put it to good use. Another step is to set your priorities well. Focusing our energy toward one main goal means we may have to let go of other goals, but this is by no means a disadvantage; rather, prioritization gives us a better understanding of our energy levels and helps us learn to work within our limits. And priorities can always be shifted according to how you perceive your needs. Finally, learning to accept your commitment to a goal, rather than fighting it, can give you an unparalleled energy boost. By diving into a new endeavor wholeheartedly, and by recognizing and welcoming the work that comes along with mastery, you’ll give yourself plenty of fuel for the entire journey. The key message in this book Mastering a new skill isn’t about the results you achieve, the recognition you get from your peers or  even repetitive practice that helps you get there. Instead, mastery is a path that you can follow to ensure your new endeavors are shaped by ongoing learning, passionate and patient practice and a rediscovery of your own human potential.  Actionable advice: Turn your dishwashing into mastery practice. Next time you’re doing the dishes, don’t just try to finish them as quickly as possible. Instead, take a moment before you start and consider how you could do them in the most effective way. Then, once you begin, be mindful of every movement you make, taking care to do things well, rather than forcing yourself to rush. Though doing the dishes will feel slower this way at first, you’ll soon find that a more considered approach is faster and cleaner! Got feedback?

The thing is, these habits can be good! They can be part of your morning routine, or constitute your mannerisms during conversations. Such habits should be celebrated, or even fostered, like when you want to start cooking more at home, or reading more. However, not all habits are good. Many people know they should quit smoking or maybe lose a few pounds, but they don't think about quitting their more invisible habits, that is, their negative thought habits. These habits can be very dangerous. These blinks start at the very beginning by explaining what habits really are, and then explain how you can take control of your habits and transform your life for the better. In these blinks, you’ll discover why your family always sits in a certain order at dinner; how to make happy habits; and what merely trying to quit smoking does to your self-control. What happens when someone throws a ball to you? In all likelihood, you catch it before you consciously realize what’s going on. This is a habit – an action repeated so frequently that it’s done unconsciously. This first aspect of a habit involves automaticity, that is, not being aware of the execution of a given action, such as flicking on a light while entering a room. Also, since repetition decreases enthusiasm, the act of performing habits is emotionless. Consider your morning routine: Does it conjure up strong emotions for you? Or imagine looking out upon a mountain range for hours from your office window every single day. It’s wonderful and breathtaking at first, but, over time, the pleasure of seeing it greatly decreases. In addition to automaticity, context also defines habits because of the associations you form between your surroundings and your behavior. Remember what it was like to be a student? The freedom of almost zero obligations and the beers you enjoyed with your friends? You may well connect the pleasures of socializing with the habit of drinking alcohol because of these early experiences, so now every time you socialize, you want to drink a beer. But how are habits actually formed? Take a look at the following: First, intentions create habits. For example, you want to have healthy, white teeth, so you start brushing them regularly. Another way habits are formed is through explaining random past behavior by adding an intention later on. Say you always sit in the same place in your friend’s kitchen because it was the only free spot when you first visited her. Now, however, you tell yourself it’s your favorite place because the light is just right and the chair is comfy. Finally, you can combine both the intention and explanation behind your habits. Perhaps you started biking to work because you were dieting, but you continue doing it because you enjoy being out in the fresh air. What habits play a role in your life? Perhaps dieting and smoking spring to mind. But our lives are actually full of many different habits. A minimum of one-third of our waking life is powered by our unconscious, where we operate on auto-pilot, not fully cognizant of what we’re doing while we’re doing it. It’s not surprising, then, to find you have many more habits than you might think. Social habits, such as who sits where at the family dinner table; work routines like saying “mm hmm” and “a-ha” during meetings; eating habits that help us sift through multitudes of food-related decisions every day – and the list goes on! Do you ever catch yourself checking your email for the hundredth time only to discover that, still, nothing interesting has arrived in your inbox? Then you’ve experienced what behavioral psychologists call the partial reinforcement extinction effect, when you keep repeating the same action, even without reward, simply because you’re used to doing it unrewarded. Even if we get the rare reward of an interesting email, we keep robotically refreshing our inbox regardless, as we’re used to the frustration. But there are other habits that you can't see: habits of thought. If they are negative in nature, these habits can be connected to mental illnesses such as depression. Whether thoughts are positive or negative depends on our appraisal of something that happens to us, and sometimes we appraise in unhealthy ways. Imagine you lost your job. If you’re in the habit of perceiving yourself as powerless and culpable, you’ll have trouble fighting the negative emotions that unemployment entails. Another type of habit is rumination – when you think about something over and over again. Some say that retrospection can help us learn from our supposed failures, but there’s a difference between reviewing your past experiences and wallowing in the misery and pain of them. What you might not know about habits is that, even though they stem from your unconscious, you can manipulate them. This is good news indeed, especially if you want to form a new, healthy habit. To do so, follow these three steps: Determine your motivation. You need an overarching goal to help you overcome obstacles. To pinpoint your ultimate goal, you can employ the WOOP – wish, outcome, obstacle and plan – exercise. Start by writing your wish down, along with the best possible outcome, and the obstacles you are likely to face. Say that your wish is to run daily. Your outcome might be to get in shape so you can complete a 10km run and your obstacles will probably be harsh weather and physical discomfort. Next up, you need to plan by finding the right implementation intention and act on “if x, then y” decisions. For example, “If I enter a building, I will take the stairs.” Positive statements like “I’ll take the stairs” are far more effective than “I’m not taking the elevator,” as self-denial reinforces the attraction of something – in this case, the elevator. Next, remember to repeat your actions, as repetition leads to automation. If you’re unsatisfied with your habit development, try coping planning: Anticipate challenging situations for your new habit, such as heavy rain or being late for work, and find the right if-then solution. For example, “If it is raining, I’ll try my waterproof running gear.” Finally, make your habits happy habits. One way to do this is to avoid becoming habituated to something and just going through the motions. Ironically, “habituation” is the anathema to happy habits. Having happy habits means switching it up. This could mean taking different routes to work in order to keep enjoying your bike rides, or techniques like savoring, where you pause and intentionally engage your senses to savor the moment, such as stopping to smell a fragrant flower. Nearly all of us have bad habits we want to kick. Perhaps we’re overweight or want to rid ourselves of nicotine addiction. For many of us, though, it’s hard to change. One survey, conducted in the 1980s, at the University of Scranton, found that out of 213 people, 60 percent weren’t able to stick to their New Year's resolutions. So what can we do to break free of these habits? First, recognize the habit you want to kick. The consequences of bad habits are often more obvious than the habits themselves. It’s easy, for example, to recognize that you’re overweight, or, if you’re a smoker, that you’re out of breath. To find them, you can use mindfulness, the conscious recognition of what you’re doing in any given moment. Mindfulness takes a little practice. You can start with the following exercise: Relax your body and sit comfortably in your favorite chair. Then, give your focus to one thing, such as your breath. As you sit, be non-judgmental and open-hearted with yourself and compassionate toward your thoughts and feelings. This is the first step toward dropping your bad habits, as the more mindful you are, the more aware you’ll be of what you’re doing, including your habitual actions. Another great approach working on your self-control. Self-control is like a muscle; it strengthens through training. Merely trying to break a habit can help. When you get frustrated, bear in mind that we sometimes tend to overestimate our ability to control ourselves. Say you want to quit smoking. Just trying to stop will be good for your willpower. Once you know you can go one week without nicotine, for example, you can try going for two. Here are some other basic ways to get your habits under control: monitoring behavior, by, say, keeping a food diary; distraction, like chewing gum instead of smoking a cigarette; and changing your environment – for example, moving to a new, non-smoking apartment. The key message in this book: Habits play a huge role in our lives. With a little awareness of what habits actually are and a bit of practice in some straightforward psychological techniques, we can break free of our unhealthy habits and create ones that serve us. Actionable advice: Hack your diet. Try some of these tricks to make sure you stick to your diet: We tend to eat food that is close and visible, so put some fruit on the table instead of cake. Use smaller plates at meal times. Larger plates encourage you to eat more than you actually need. Try eating with your non-dominant hand. This slows you down and gives you a chance to register that you’re getting full, so you don’t automatically reach for more. Suggested further reading: The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg The Power of Habit explains how important a role habits play in our lives, from brushing our teeth to smoking to exercising, and how exactly those habits are formed.

Or maybe ballet? Or how to be a good debater? When it comes to learning a new skill or diving into a new hobby, most of us are dissuaded by the amount of time and effort such tasks require. That’s where micromastery can help. Micromastery aims to eliminate the phenomenon of demotivation, which can often stand in the way of success. By breaking up a goal into small, achievable stages, micromastery encourages you to focus on a specific skill before moving onto the next one. The sense of accomplishment you feel from completing each stage will motivate you to keep going until you finally achieve your bigger goal. The author outlines six easy-to-follow steps to start you on your way to micromastering any skill or task you wish to pursue. Not only that, there are also plenty of concrete examples to show you exactly how you can apply this learning method to your life. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the six steps involved in micromastering surfing; why micromastery is better for our brains; and what a rub-pat barrier is. Ever since the first humans walked the earth, learning has been a crucial aspect of survival. Each generation has to learn how to survive the context in which they exist. Children learn from their parents, who learn from their parents and so on. To journey through life and handle all the challenges that come our way, we have to train our brains how to learn in the first place. Micromastery is a mental workout. Our brains are constantly changing, and if we don’t give them exercise by learning new things, we will fail to forge new neural connections that allow us to perform tasks. Indeed, we could end up forgetting how to do something if we allow our neural pathways to become weakened through inactivity. Think, for example, of when you forget a phone number you used to know by heart. The neural connection that used to link this information with your memory has degraded, likely since you no longer call the number regularly. As micromastery focuses on learning smaller things quickly, it’s a great way for regularly exercising the brain, giving it a neurological kickstart and encouraging growth. Micromastery also helps facilitate a polymathic lifestyle, meaning a lifestyle that involves continuously learning many different skills. And that’s great because there’s a neurological advantage to being a polymath. If we go through our lives on autopilot and stop learning and challenging ourselves with different mental stimuli, our cognitive abilities will begin to degrade. Over time, this can lead to senility. When applying the concept of micromastery, however, the brain is fed varied and multisensory input that keeps it in good shape. Many of the brain’s neurons are multisensory – that is, they deal with input from numerous senses at once, such as smell, hearing and taste. The more senses used, the stronger the neural connections and, thus, the better the brain learns. For instance, in preparation for your test on US history, you’re more likely to recall your lecture notes if you watch a video on the topic, as opposed to rereading a textbook. This is because the video provides you with both visual and audio stimuli, helping your brain form stronger connections. Now that we know the science behind micromastery, let’s look at how it works. First, every micromastery involves an entry trick, which is a cunning scheme that speeds up your performance and pays off immediately. To illustrate this, let’s consider the act of balancing stones on top of each other. The entry trick in this case would be to find stones that have three raised bumps in close proximity, in the shape of a triangle. These three bumps will create a small platform that another stone can easily fit on top of and stay in place. Second, micromasteries each have a rub-pat barrier, which is the obstacle that arises when two required skills are incongruent with each other. The name of this element comes from the game of simultaneously rubbing your stomach and patting your head. If you try it out yourself, you’ll see that it’s often difficult to do on the first attempt, hence the barrier. If we continue with our previous example of stone balancing, the two skills you would need to coordinate are working out how to balance the stones while also visualizing the shape of the tower. Let’s say you’ve found five stones that are the perfect shape for stacking, but then you find out that the third stone doesn’t have the three small bumps needed to balance another stone on top of it. To defeat this barrier, it is necessary to focus on each skill individually; eventually, it’ll become easier to do both at once. The third element of micromastery is background support, which clears your path of any roadblocks. Ask yourself: what will help me become successful? Do I have the right equipment to learn this new skill or task? Do I have the time? How can I make time for it? To make this point more concrete, let’s look at drawing. Say you want to learn how to draw perfect Zen circles, which is the special Japanese technique of drawing circles in one brushstroke, or two at most. What will help you achieve this skill is a really nice pen, one that makes you feel good using it – this could be a fiber-tip pen or a brush pen, or any other pen that can produce clean brushstrokes. So, those were the first three elements of micromastery. In the next blinks, we’ll look at the remaining three. Have you ever tried to learn an exciting, impressive skill only to end up throwing in the towel halfway through? Experiences like that illustrate why there has to be a payoff that will encourage you to keep putting in effort. If you feel like you’re getting better at something, that feeling of success will make you want to continue. The key is to ensure that the payoff is both achievable and unambiguous. This is why mastering the art of cooking an omelet first is better than going straight to learning everything necessary to become a master chef. Once you know how to make a great omelet, it will provide you with a sense of achievement, which will motivate you to continue learning. The next element of micromastery is repeatability. If you can replicate a micromastery over and over again, you will be able to see your improvements with each repetition, increasing your confidence. In a bid to improve his drawing skills, the author set himself the task of drawing each cup of coffee he ordered at a cafe. It was a simple exercise, and one that he could easily repeat. He made sure to draw every cup and saucer – even if just a quick sketch when he was in a hurry – and began to feel more confident with each iteration. The sixth and final element of micromastery is experimentation. Experimentation enables you to play around with the skill or task you’re trying to learn, which prevents the process from becoming tedious. Furthermore, it maintains your curiosity, which helps expand your desire for further knowledge and involvement with the task at hand. Another task the author wanted to micromaster was the J-stroke, which is used at the back of a canoe to help steer it. He first tried to learn it from instructions he’d read in a book, but to no avail. Then an expert gave him one life-changing piece of advice: try other strokes. With this encouragement, the author allowed himself to play around with other strokes, like the L- and C-strokes. Eventually, he made enough progress to return to – and master – the J-stroke. Now that we’ve learned about the structure of micromastery, let’s see how to put it to use. Ever thought about taking up surfing? Well, here’s a rundown on how you can micromaster this sport. First, the entry trick associated with surfing is a dry-run practice of jumping up from a lying position to a standing one. This involves lying face-down on the ground and then springing up immediately to stand on your feet. When you are lying down, arch your back so that your stomach is still on the floor, then pop up into a vertical stance on the surfboard. Make sure your front foot is aligned under your shoulder and you’re facing forward, but your body is angled at roughly 45 degrees, either to the left or right. After a few tries you can try doing the same moves on a surface that’s less stable, like a bed. Second, the rub-pat barrier involves coordinating the board’s forward momentum on the water with your upward thrust. Popping up too early will make you lose your balance. But if you do it too late, you’ll lose control of the board. The key is to keep practicing both skills; eventually, you’ll be able to master both at once. Third is background support. To micromaster surfing, you need all the necessary equipment, which includes a full-body wetsuit if you’re not a fan of cold water. Ensuring that you stay warm and comfortable will keep you in the water for longer. Fourth, the immediate payoff is the awesome journeys you will take. Surfing is done all over the world, including vastly different countries such as Angola and Norway. It will break up the mundane routine of everyday life and set you hunting for new and exciting beaches. Fifth, repetition will be easy, seeing as surfing is so addictive. To make it even more enjoyable and help you repeat it, invite some friends to join you on the surf. It doesn’t matter if you go at it for a short or long while – just as long as you keep doing it. Finally, try out some experiments while surfing. When surfing first came about, two different variants emerged: full-body surfing – the version discussed earlier, in which you spring up from a lying position – and paddling while upright on the board. There’s no right way of surfing, so why not try out both? If you don’t feel like learning how to surf – or don’t have access to a beach – why not try to micromaster baking artisan bread? To illustrate just how handy entry tricks are to jump-starting the micromastery of any skill, here are three examples related to baking bread. The first entry trick is dedicating a whole day to breadmaking. Baking is a lengthy process, and a lack of time will surely throw off your bread game. Therefore, you need to make sure you allocate enough hours to prepare not only for the baking time, but also for preparing the dough. You don’t want to cut any corners as the results won’t be nearly as good. The second entry trick is to keep the dough wet. To combat the stickiness of the dough, many people add more flour to their hands, to the kneading surface and to the dough itself. This is counterproductive, however, as your dough will become heavier and more difficult to bake. What you should do instead is use a bit of olive oil on the kneading surface and your hands, which will remove some of the stickiness while keeping the dough light. Entry trick number three is to use good flour, dry yeast and warm water. For example, you can use super-strong, organic Canadian flour, either as is or mixed evenly with common bread flour. Dry yeast, meanwhile, is a lot easier to control than wet yeast, so it’s good for beginners. Once all the ingredients are combined, the dough needs to be kneaded for roughly ten minutes – that means ten minutes of stretching and pummelling! To check that it’s been kneaded enough, break off a small piece of the dough and slowly pull it apart. If it stretches to the point that it appears almost transparent, then it’s ready for proving, which we’ll learn more about in the final blink. After the entry trick, there are five more steps involved in micromastering baking bread. The next step is the rub-pat barrier. In this case, it involves balancing temperature and time during proving, which refers to when the dough rises due to the addition of yeast before being put in the oven. Balancing time and temperature is important because the yeast will die if the dough is kept at an air temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius. On the one hand, if kept at a higher temperature, the bread will have more flavor; on the other hand, at a lower temperature, the dough can prove for longer. To balance time and temperature just right, heat your oven up to 50 degrees Celsius, switching it off just before you put the dough in for proving. Both the dough and the bowl holding it will absorb the residual heat, and the dough will reach the optimal temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. When you can stick two fingers into the dough and the indent remains (or slowly rises back up), the proving is done. Then comes the kneading, which you will do for about ten minutes, before proving the dough again – though this time in a baking tin. Following these steps, your bread should expand in size by 150 to 200 percent. The third element to micromaster baking bread involves background support. So, in addition to good flour, you will need the right equipment. This includes measuring scales, a surface on which to knead the dough and so forth. Go after what’s easiest to use without sacrificing quality. The fourth step is the immediate payoff, which in this case is the taste and smell of freshly baked bread. Who wouldn’t prefer fresh homemade bread to dry, store-bought loaves? The next element is repetition, and with baking, you can easily turn it into a weekly routine. To ensure that you don’t miss a week of baking, keep your cupboards stocked with the necessary supplies. The last element is experimentation, which baking definitely allows for. Just think of all the different quantities you can include of each ingredient, as well as the different types of ingredients you can add. You can experiment with the proving time, or with different flavors – why not try adding olives to your next batch? So now that you know the basic steps of micromastery, you’re ready to take on any new skill – whether it be surfing, baking or something else entirely! The key message in these blinks: Learning something new can sometimes be overwhelming and can demotivate us from sticking with it. That’s why it’s much more efficient to learn various smaller tasks quickly and work your way gradually toward mastering a skill, which is a method called micromastery. Micromastery involves six main elements: an entry trick, the rub-pat barrier, background support, immediate payoff, repetition and experimentation. Actionable advice: Draw perfect circles. To become a master at drawing, you first need to micromaster drawing circles. Coordinate time and accuracy until you can quickly and easily draw perfectly round circles. Find a good pen and keep practicing until you get it right. After that, you can start adding details to the circles and create some circular designs. Got feedback?

Sure, having a well-trained body is essential, but your mind, your attitude and your mental grit are equally important. Because, when you’re nearing the end of the race and your body is on the verge of giving up, it’s your mind that will push you over the finish line. But a well-trained mind doesn’t just come in handy in long-distance running. If you want to succeed in life, you should make sure to give your mind – the most important muscle of all – regular exercise. It’s time to step into the Mind Gym. These blinks will show you the ropes. You’ll also learn what your most important muscle is, no matter what the sport; why your goals should be SMART; and why 90 percent is better than 100. We all know that good old Nike slogan: Just do it. You might also know that, for all it’s simplicity, this piece of advice is often hard to follow. Why? Negative thinking stops us from taking action. It’s funny how our thoughts seem to impact us precisely the way we don’t want them to. If, while playing golf, you tell yourself not to hit the water, you’re likely to hit it anyway. Why? Your thoughts were so focused on the water that your body began aiming for it, too. Avoid outcomes like this by keeping it simple and focusing on what you want, not all the things you’re afraid might happen. Of course, the power of thought alone can’t carry us toward success. It’s the combination of physical and mental training that allows us to perform to our full potential. One study of three groups of basketball players demonstrated just this. The first group took free throws for one hour, the second sat and visualized their free throws for an hour, and the third did both for 30 minutes each. When it came to the free throws afterwards, the third group outperformed the others by far. While most of us know more or less how to train our bodies, few really know what to do when it comes to training our brains. Like our bodies, our minds have their own strengths and weaknesses. Pinpointing these will give us both confidence in our abilities and a clear idea of where we need improvement. Get started on your brain training journey with some inspiration from the Japanese concept of kaizen. This refers to constant daily learning simply for the sake of improving yourself one step at a time without stressing too much about the final outcome. If you think like this, you’ll have an open mind ready to take in anything that can make you a stronger, better person. Do you consider yourself a winner or a loser? Sure, you might not think yourself a winner right now, perhaps because you haven’t performed so well competitively, or because you feel your skills aren’t quite there yet. But if you really want to increase your chances of success, it’s time to put that all aside. If you think of yourself as a winner, it’ll make you more likely to become one.  Self-consistency theory explains that the way we think about ourselves is powerful enough to impact our actions. This is why those with a negative self-image struggle to achieve top performances. Put simply, you can’t win if you see yourself as a loser.  But what if you don’t think you’re a loser, but know you aren’t the best yet? Start taking steps toward where you want to be! Use SMART goals to keep yourself focused on progress. These are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound goals. So, if you’re aiming to run a marathon at the year’s end, your SMART goal could be running two miles for two days in the first week, three miles three days the week after, and building up in that rhythm until you can run 13 miles each week, which is half the length of the actual marathon.  By contrast, if you decided your goal was completing a half marathon as quickly as possible, your training would collapse. Why? Your goal was unrealistic and, as a result, demotivating. On the other hand, if your goal was to just try and run a little each day, you’d be lucky to make it to the marathon at the end of the year. Why? Your goal just wasn’t specific enough to ensure progress.  While outlining and working toward your SMART goals, do your best to maintain determination, dedication and discipline. It’s too easy to retreat to a negative self-image and stop working toward your goals.  Of course, nobody becomes a winner without a few failures along the way. It’s perfectly natural to fail, yet many athletes are incredibly afraid of it. So rather than learning from their mistakes, they only play it safe. This is due to our false belief that we have to be perfect. But although perfectionism seems like a positive thing, it’s ultimately a hindrance. An aspiring basketball player shouldn’t aim for a 100 percent success rate at free throws. When you make the slightest mistake, you’ll feel like you’ve failed yourself.  There’s no need to put yourself in that position! Your goal should be centered on steady improvement, which will help you to see failure for what it really is: feedback, that is, the information that will help you continue to grow and learn. We all know that in many sports, the physically strongest and toughest have an advantage. The strong, tough wrestler has a considerable advantage over an opponent weaker in body. And yet, toughness isn’t all about bulging biceps: mental toughness is just as important as physical toughness. In order to develop mental toughness, you need to train yourself in seven areas – the seven C’s of mental toughness. The first of these is competitiveness. The mentally tough are driven to battle against adversaries and come out on top. For example, it was competitive spirit that pushed Michael Jordan to leave basketball – a game he had mastered – and take up major league baseball. He couldn’t let himself grow old without trying to master another sport he loved. Having mental fortitude also relies on not being afraid of a difficult opponent. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that successful people have an abundance of courage. They aren’t scared, even by the most daunting challenges. Then there is confidence. Mentally robust people simply believe they are always going to win. To return to Michael Jordan, every time he stepped onto the court he was convinced he was the best player out there. This confidence helped ensure he almost always was. Perhaps the most obvious signs of mental toughness are control and composure. Those who are able to focus and keep their emotions in check even in the face of enormous pressure are the ones who will think and act in the clearest, most appropriate manner. Consistency is another vital component of mental strength. Winners are always at the top of their game, regardless of how they’re feeling. For example, when a mentally tough person is under the weather, she doesn’t use this as an excuse to perform poorly – she resolves to try as hard as ever. Finally, mental toughness requires commitment. This isn’t simply about having the skills to be a stellar athlete or businessperson – you have to want to be successful at it and commit to working hard until you achieve your ultimate goal. Now that we’ve spent some time investigating how you can work your way to success, it’s time to take a closer look at success itself. What is it? We often consider success, excellence and top performance as quantifiable, in the form of records, medals and prizes. And yet, there’s a form of excellence that can’t be measured – and it also happens to be the most worthwhile. Great athletes will benefit from aspiring to inner excellence. This is a reflective state of mind in which you are accountable for your thoughts, feelings and actions, no matter how much you want to give up. Here, competitions become challenges that kick your drive to succeed into gear, with no fear of failure to hold you back. It’s in this state that you’ll allow yourself to shine. Channel your inner excellence next time the going gets tough. The setbacks you’re facing now might end up being totally trivial in the scheme of things. Take basketball superstar Michael Jordan, who didn’t make his high school basketball team! But by staying optimistic, he gave himself the chance to witness what he could do, not what he couldn’t. Another misconception we hold about success is that it’s defined by pushing ourselves to the absolute limit. This simply isn’t true. Though counterintuitive, a great way to get better faster is by slowing down. Human muscle tissue makes a great analogy for this. Muscles can be considered in terms of two categories: agonists and antagonists. While they both work hard when we run at top speed, agonists are working to accelerate us while antagonists will work to slow us down. But, if we only give 90 percent of our effort, we’ll be faster. How? Because the antagonist muscle won’t be working so hard to set you back.  When it comes to judging your success, whose opinion should you trust? Should you ask your colleagues? Friends? Maybe even your rivals? Well, when it comes to deciding how worthy your achievements have been, the only person you should ask is yourself. Only you can tell whether you’ve given your all. When judging yourself, take a look at a few of the areas considered by Harvard researchers to make up the metrics of a successful life. The first area is love. Whatever you do, be it a hobby or a job, you have to love doing it, otherwise you won’t succeed at it. Think of it this way: say you want to become a top athlete. In order to become outstanding, you’ll have to push through a great deal of adversity. Without the love of doing it, you’ll never overcome all the injuries, late nights, and aching muscles. Love goes hand-in-hand with the next factor – labor. A strong work ethic is essential for success. In fact, it can be more important than natural talent. Consider basketball star, Larry Bird. Despite not being blessed with the perfect physique for the game, he worked tirelessly to become a basketball great.    The next key area of a successful life, especially as you grow older, is being able to learn. Young people are often brimming with natural talent, such as a hardy constitution or an athletic physique. Yet, as we age, these natural powers begin to fade. With the most successful people, this faltering body is replaced by a stronger mind. Drawing from all of their experiences, their mistakes and successes, older people are perfectly positioned to learn the tips to staying successful. If you bear all of these factors in mind, whenever you look in the mirror, you’ll be able to judge yourself in a favorable light. The key message in this book: Training your body and your mind go hand in hand when it comes to achieving your goals as an athlete. Positive attitudes you have toward yourself and your progress have a powerful influence on your performance. Learning to accept failure, set goals and slow down will help you to center yourself and unlock your full potential.  Actionable advice: To be successful keep your mind in the present. It’s when your mind and body are working together seamlessly that you’re really in the moment. Focusing on the present will alleviate any pressure you experience. With no anxieties about the future or ruminations on the past, you can become totally absorbed in the task at hand. Pay attention to the skill you’re working on, and save the judgement and analysis for later. Enjoy the present moment, don’t rush through it, and you’ll give your focus and fulfillment a major boost.

Traumatic events during childhood can deeply affect us until old age. Injuries to our bodies can transform the way we perceive the world, and conflict in our social environments, be it at home or at work, can lead to stress and depression. What can we do to find our way back to ourselves, to understand how we make sense of the world and how to live in harmony with our social environments? We can apply mindsight, a set of psychological techniques designed to help us understand and reshape our inner worlds. In these blinks, you will learn what mindsight entails, how it relates to your mind, body and social relations and how you can apply it. You will see various examples where mindsight is a valuable approach and will learn about its power to bring about positive change. You’ll also find out why an ocean is a good metaphor for your mind; what watching movies with the sound turned off can teach you; and how mindsight will facilitate dialogue with your partner. Have you ever been in the middle of an important discussion when something pushes you over the edge? You might suddenly grow angry, your mind might go blank or perhaps you’ll feel an uncontrollable urge to leave the room as quickly as possible. Sound familiar? Many of us experience reactions like this. They can be deeply confusing, leaving us at a loss to explain our own behavior. To understand these situations, we need to understand our internal worlds – and to do this, we need mindsight. Mindsight is the skill that allows us to reflect on the connection between the body and the mind. This is central to learning how to regulate powerful emotions. Mindfulness techniques such as meditation are examples of mindsight, as they increase our awareness of our heartbeat and breathing. But mindsight isn’t just something to practice when you have quiet time to yourself; it is a tool that you can use when life gets loud, messy and overwhelming. For instance, watching your kids scream and fight over food can make you upset. However, your children aren’t the direct cause of your growing distress – it’s your increasing heart rate. By turning your attention and awareness to your heart rate, you can learn to regulate its influence on your emotions and get a better grip on the situation before you. By remaining calm and patient, you’ll be able to settle the conflict between your children, rather than exacerbate it by reacting with frustration. As well as looking into your own internal landscape, mindsight encourages us to see the world through the eyes of those around us. This is something all humans are innately capable of, even though we often take it for granted; without the capacity for empathy, we would struggle immensely. This is a challenge faced by Barbara, one of the author’s patients. During a car accident, the mother of three suffered damage to her prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that enables us to use mindsight to empathize with others. Having lost her sense of empathy, Barbara has struggled to maintain caring relationships with her kids and friends. So what does a life with good mindsight look like? Let’s take a closer look in the next blink. Some of us are addicted to rigid morning routines. Others start to squirm if something feels too “planned.” Whether you’re strict or spontaneous, too much focus on either extreme can make you hard to be around, and unhappier in the long run. Your best bet is to find the right balance by creating a harmonic self. Having a harmonic self is all about keeping your personality balanced. With a balanced personality, you’ll be able to adapt to external changes, but will also stay stable and true to your core values. This is a bit hard to grasp in abstract terms, so mindsight-based therapy makes use of the image of a gently flowing river. Rather than clashing with changes in your relationships and environment, simply make room for them while continuing on your original course. To make your personality flow, you must first accept that it’s normal to act in a range of different ways, to have relationships that contrast with one another and that past experiences will shape you in different ways as you grow older. A harmonic personality is also tied to creating a balance between rational, analytical thinking and emotional, intuitive thinking. While both modes of thinking are valuable, placing too much emphasis on one or the other can be detrimental. Take Stuart, one of the author’s patients, a retired lawyer who was suffering from depression. It turned out that because Stuart only accepted rational, logical thoughts, he’d been repressing his emotions for years; this imbalance was at the heart of his sense of emptiness. For Stuart, learning to appreciate his emotional and rational sides in equal measure was the first step to overcoming his depression. Mindsight can be a powerful part of psychotherapy. With a deeper understanding of how brain activity shapes the way we see the world, you’ll be able to harness the power of mindsight. So how does it work? Mindsight is like training for your brain. It teaches us how to reflect on thoughts and helps us create new connections between them. The more we associate two ideas with each other as we reflect on them, the stronger the neural relationship between those ideas will become. Mindsight also trains our brains by boosting memory. Conscious reflection on past or future situations can be as vivid and powerful as experiencing those events themselves. By encouraging our minds to re-enact entire scenes in full detail, we activate the same areas of our brains that would light up if what we were imagining was taking place in real life. Neuroscience has even demonstrated that every single thought we have alters blood flow and neural signal rates. By dedicating time to training our brains, we’re better able to deal with unexpected challenges. Our neural behavior directly shapes how we manage issues in our environment – so much so that certain physical parts of our brain are responsible for different reactions. The prefrontal cortex, located just behind the forehead, triggers moral judgments, our attention (or lack thereof), our sense of time and our sense of identity. The insula, on the other hand, is responsible for our emotions, as well as how we respond to the emotional displays of others. Mirror neurons are specialized cells that help us understand the intentions of those around us. Since mindsight allows us to boost our awareness of these areas of the brain, we’re able to better control the reactions that they create. You might think that talking about your feelings is simply a matter of opening up. Sometimes, we experience emotions that we’re not even aware of. But just like any other skill, becoming aware of our emotions can be learned; practice makes perfect! This is a central focus of mindsight-based therapies. Mindsight targets the right hemisphere of the brain, which is responsible for our emotional awareness. Though we’re more comfortable exercising the rational capabilities of the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere is the side we should exercise to deepen our understanding of our own feelings. Thankfully, this isn’t too hard to do. You can stimulate your right hemisphere by taking part in nonverbal communication games, from imitating facial expressions, to trying to read movie character’s emotions with the sound off. You can also keep a diary to record all the emotional sensations and imagery of your experiences, rather than rationalizing them. When you’re confronted with your own intense emotions, you can use other techniques that focus awareness on bodily sensations. The next time you’re stressed out, try doing the body scan. This entails lying down on the floor and focusing on different parts of your body, one by one. This can be quite uncomfortable at first, as a sore back or itchy nose might make it hard for you to concentrate. But with practice, you can focus your mind on mental images of safe places to stay in control of your responses. One of the author’s patients hyperventilated while doing a body scan. After ensuring the patient felt safe with her, they prepared a mental image of a safe space together to try for next time; the safe space, in this case, was a cove at the beach. On her next attempt at the body scan, the patient was able to focus calmly, without letting the intense sensations of her body bother her. While it’s all too easy to tell someone to “keep their temper,” emotions can be very tough to manage. Many people find emotions overwhelming and distressing, but mindsight helps us realize that they’re all just fleeting parts of the human experience, rather than ingrained behaviors that indicate we’re somehow flawed and dysfunctional. Meditation exercises, for instance, train people to focus on one thing and one thing only. Such exercises require that, if you do get distracted, you bounce back and return to your focus. This is a great way to experience how thoughts and feelings are just temporary experiences, rather than the foundations of your personality. Another exercise to try involves imagining that your mind is an ocean. Your thoughts and feelings are what moves over the ocean's surface; they can be ripples, or they can be storms. But no matter how big the waves, there is calmness at the bottom of the ocean. Stormy feelings are surface-level and temporary – it’s up to you to find the calmness on the ocean floor! More broadly, mindsight exercises like the above two examples are built around three key pillars: observation, objectivity and openness. By learning to take all three of these in your stride, you’ll be better positioned to understand your own feelings. Learn to observe your mind by noticing when distracting thoughts pull you away from your focus. This might be during meditation, or even when negative thoughts slow your productivity at work or make it hard to fall asleep at night. Next, realize that you can train yourself to objectively follow the path of your attention. You can study where your thoughts carry you and how they make you feel. This, in turn, makes you more aware of how underlying prejudices or instinctive reactions are also thoughts that shape your experiences. Finally, by staying open and accepting that judgmental, depressing or confusing thoughts are just temporary, you’ll see that emotions don’t need to be cause for distress. They’re natural, and by acknowledging that, you have the power to learn from them and change them. Who were your teachers in the first years of your life? Your parents, most likely! But parents do far more than teach us to read or how to ride a bike. We also learn a great deal from everything that they teach us subconsciously. For better or for worse, our upbringing shapes how we interact with people today. Kids raised by parents who only showed affection inconsistently often feel that they can’t trust anyone when they become adults – not in friendships, not at work, not even in loving relationships. Similarly, children who had to take on a lot of responsibility at a young age learned that showing weakness is a failure. This means that they have genuine trouble opening up about their feelings as adults – since childhood, they weren’t comfortable with being seen as vulnerable. Although these misconceptions we learned during childhood have been with us for a long time, we can, in fact, overcome them with mindsight. A great way to start is to write down as many of your earliest memories as you can, as well as some of the most recent. This helps you get everything off your chest, and will help you see what narrative you’ve used to make sense of your past as a child. Examine the story that you tell about yourself and consider the possibility that there is no need for one perfectly coherent narrative. Rather, we’re all made up of multiple narratives within each stage and aspect of our lives. The narrative you tell of your earlier life will reveal how your current difficulties are bound up with how you perceive your childhood. This helps you see these patterns for what they are: harmful. Discovering alternative stories to tell about your childhood and adult life is the first step to knocking down those walls you built around yourself as a kid. Many of us know what it’s like to have stupid fights with our partners. It starts out with one person addressing a problem, but soon seems to devolve into fighting for the sake of fighting. What prevents these discussions from being resolved peacefully? In the end, it’s a matter of attitude. The key is whether you’re reactive or receptive toward your partner. This one factor can have a massive influence on the quality of your relationship as a whole – so it’s pretty important stuff! But what does it mean? Well, being receptive means openly listening to your partner. Receptiveness makes your partner feel like you acknowledge and value their feelings, which in turn helps them open up and share what’s on their mind. Being reactive, on the other hand, is what we do when all of our partner’s complaints feel like threats to us. We enter fight-flight-freeze mode, and either want to attack our partner, defend ourselves or stop talking and avoid eye contact. This is problematic for both of you, leading to a vicious cycle. If one person feels the need to discuss an issue while her partner feels the need to flee whenever she brings it up, they’ll just want to push the issue even further away; this, in turn, can lead to endless fights and miscommunication. So what can we do better? Mindsight helps us be receptive toward our partners and facilitates dialogue in a relationship. Both partners should take the time to reassess the narratives they’ve told themselves about their lives and consider whether they’re accurate, or whether alternatives are possible. They should then share these with each other, which can help each partner understand the other’s motivations and emotional needs. Other strategies to try include the timeout method. This requires mindsight, as you’ll need to monitor your emotional state when you discuss a sensitive topic with your loved one. Call a timeout when you sense yourself reaching reactive mode – this gives you time to reflect and rejoin the conversation later. We’ve already learned how our childhood experiences can shape our adult lives. However, even experiences from young adulthood can have an impact on our attitudes today, without us even realizing why. Blackouts and angry outbursts due to excessive drinking or traumatizing experiences mean that some of our most painful memories are buried and forgotten. Even so, they continue to affect us on a subconscious level. For example, one woman struggled with back pain for years. As a teenager, she had been sexually assaulted and had her back slammed against a table. She couldn’t remember the assault, but her body continued to remind her of the traumatic experience. With mindsight techniques such as the body scan, we can regain access to the memories attached to physical difficulties that we can’t quite explain. As the brain focuses in on a particular body part, it activates related memories. This can bring repressed experiences to light, which in turn helps us accept and move on from trauma. The woman’s back pain disappeared after she realized what had been triggering it. Finally, mindsight is one of the best tools at your disposal when coping with everyday uncertainties. Humans evolved with the tendency to prefer predictability over precarious and threatening scenarios. However, this instinct can also feed into neurotic behaviors like obsessive-compulsive disorder. Those suffering from OCD know how frustrating it is to have distressing urges that simply won’t go away until they perform a ritual behavior. For example, someone with OCD may feel an intense need to knock on a desk three times when thinking about a relative dying, just to make sure it doesn’t happen. Thankfully, this disorder can also be addressed with mindsight. Imagine the distressing urge is a person with whom you can start a discussion. You’re able to negotiate whether you really need to check five times that you locked the door, or whether twice is enough. Gradually, you’ll find it easier and easier to deal with these urges. The key message in this book: Difficult or troubling emotions aren’t indelible parts of our personality; rather, they’re shaped by the structure of the human brain and the experiences we have as children. Discover the power of mindsight by learning to reflect, train and regulate your emotional responses, which will help you when facing conflict with loved ones, dealing with past trauma and managing everyday uncertainty.  Actionable Advice: Worried about something? Observe it and name it to tame it! The next time you can’t stop worrying, whether it’s about yourself, people you know or a bigger situation, take a step back to reflect on your thoughts. You could even try a body scan! Try to pinpoint the real source of your worries, and dissect them to learn more. By acknowledging and accepting your nervous feelings, you’ll be able to manage them with ease. Got feedback?

Some are highly productive and help the company move forward, while others just settle in for the ride without contributing much. So how do you create an organization in which everyone helps push toward a common goal? Part of the answer lies in expecting more of everyone in the company. People grow when those around them have higher expectations of them. It’s also important that those who contribute more, who are more engaged and motivated to move the company toward its goals, get to shine and receive the credit they deserve. Everyone in the company should try to learn from them.  In these blinks, you’ll learn what the Flintstones have to do with creating a more successful company; why every organization is like a big bus; and what’s wrong with work ethics in the United States today. For business owners, it’s a tough world out there. But luckily there are a few simple tools for improving ourselves, motivating others and helping our companies succeed.  First, cultivate high expectations of yourself and others. In other words, set goals to accomplish more, be better and succeed faster.  But here’s the thing: high expectations don’t mean bupkis if you aren’t accountable. Meaning, if you expect a lot from someone, you have to make it possible for them to deliver by clearly communicating what you expect. For instance, you might ask them to prepare two pages on a specific subject by tomorrow morning.  And if they don’t come through, deliver the message again with more clarity and specificity. You should be encouraging and make sure you don’t communicate everything all at once. By making requests in small doses, you’ll make it possible for the other person to take it one thing at a time.  Consider Ron Clark’s eponymous Ron Clark Academy, an award-winning nonprofit middle school in Atlanta. The institution makes a point of educating its teachers, thus sending them into the classroom with energy and passion. When it conducts staff seminars, the school motivates teachers by challenging them, helping them set high expectations for their own classroom performance.  To show others how to adapt this model, Ron Clark developed the following metaphor: imagine a bus in a Flintstones cartoon. There’s no engine, so your team has to push the bus to get it to move. The bus stands for your goals: you’ll only be able to move the bus (i.e., reach your goals) if everyone performs together at a high level.  The “everyone” part is really crucial: each member of the team – no matter what their role – has a contribution to make. And in the end, you’ll only succeed by working together.  Let’s stick with the bus metaphor to understand how it works. On our Flintstones bus, people have different roles.  First, there’s the Driver – steering the team, pushing everyone forward. Then there are the Runners, who are top performers. Next we’ve got the Joggers: these are conscientious, diligent workers doing a good job. Then come the Walkers, who contribute little forward momentum. And then finally, the Riders: essentially dead weight. In an organization, Drivers are the managers; they give direction and support. Drivers should make the Runners their first priority: these workers want to be part of something special. They typically contribute many new ideas, have a strong work ethic and don’t make excuses. In other words, Runners put their job first. And if you let them, they’ll be the backbone of your organization. Just make sure you don’t crush their spirit with criticism – instead give them direction and support.  Meanwhile, Joggers don’t regularly exceed expectations, but when called upon, they will switch into high gear. Typically, these workers believe that they’re already doing their best and lack the confidence to try harder. But at the same time, they burn for recognition.  Next come the Walkers, who perform slowly but steadily. Walkers don’t like change and they often complain, which slows others down and spreads negativity throughout the organization.  But they’re still far better than Riders, who only perform when someone is watching, choosing to hide behind the team instead. These workers are often smart, but they lack a work ethic. Turning them into Walkers is tough, since they’re only likely to become motivated once fired. That makes it very hard to handle them.  Nonetheless, Walkers and Joggers do have the potential to become Runners. And in the following blinks, we’ll figure out how to make that happen. If you want to improve your organization, you must adopt the habits and behaviors of a Runner. Start with the easy parts: show up early, put in the time to perform well and always dress your best.  That last point might seem trivial, but if you want to be a Runner, you should have no dress-down days with regards to your clothing or your performance. By dressing well, you’re displaying your engagement and commitment to your job. You should also be mindful of how you communicate. Make sure you never participate in negative conversations. Instead, either change topics or pose the question: “How can we make things better?” Positive conversations are the only way to produce positive results and empower those around you.  One more thing: make sure you complete tasks. If you have something on your plate, finish it. That way you will show others that you can meet high expectations.  The best way to speed up your progress is by learning from Runners themselves. Ask for help: this won’t show weakness; it’ll let others know that you care about your performance. (Plus, networking with high achievers will help you move forward in the future.) But when you reach out to Runners, make sure you’re open to their criticism. After all, you’re trying to improve. And you might not be able to see what others see – so take their advice and make the best of it.  For example, if your boss points out a mistake, there is only one acceptable answer: “I am sorry. It will never happen again.” That way, instead of having a long conversation about it, you can simply show your boss that you’ve heard their feedback. And then you can both move on.  But what happens if you just don’t have it in you to become a Runner? Keep reading to find out. You don’t have to be a Runner to play a vital role in your organization. But you do have to put the needs of the organization ahead of your desire to reap rewards. Personal rewards will come to you – but first you have to know your role. If you’re not a Runner and you want to become one, start by taking on menial tasks, take the hint when your ideas are put down and listen more than you talk. Be present in meetings, look others in the eye while they’re talking and be attentive: show that you value other people’s ideas by taking notes.  And when you do voice ideas in meetings, always ensure you present solutions. If your solution doesn’t work, try again. Show that you’re a solutions person and pretty soon, people might start to see you as a Runner. It’s also hugely important to be highly credible: honor your commitments and complete your tasks. You should also smile a lot to show your positive spirit.  Following those tips might help you become a Runner. But in the meantime, step aside to let the already established Runners reap their rewards.  This might seem counterintuitive: contemporary work culture has created an environment of entitlement. Many of us feel that we deserve bonuses and high paychecks, as though everyone on the team deserves a trophy, and not just the Most Valuable Player. But that sends the wrong message: you shouldn’t get something if someone else worked harder for it. Unfortunately, today many people have forgotten how to work hard, but it’s important to remember that you don’t deserve an award just for showing up. We’ve discussed how to become a Runner and how to work with other Runners. But what do you need to know to succeed as a driver? The Driver is the boss: you map the route, you give directions, you ask for support.  It’s a vital role, but sometimes Drivers worry that the Runners will overtake them. Don’t think that way! For the team to succeed, Runners and Drivers have to work together. At first, Runners rely on their Driver for management and direction. But if the Driver doesn’t allow the Runners to shine they will feel unappreciated and slow down. The Driver can prevent that by motivating employees, protecting them from jealousy and making sure they aren’t constrained.  Then, after taking care of the Runners, the Driver can turn their attention to other staffers. Joggers need support to become their best selves: to help boost their performance, tell them what you like about their work and give directions with praise. Walkers can also improve. These workers typically lack role models – they have never learned how to have a strong work ethic. With Walkers, you need to be explicit about your high expectations – but if you guide them, they will grow. Help them cultivate a willingness to learn, grow and improve.  Like Walkers, Riders are hopeless without role models. You have to decide whether they have the capacity to improve and make a worthwhile contribution to the organization. If so, start them out on grunt work and spend time guiding them. If that doesn’t work, kick them out.  And lastly, focus on the workplace culture. Make sure each member of your staff has the tools they need to meet your high expectations. Then make the journey toward your goals fun and enjoyable.  To that end, creating space for special moments and joking around will boost productivity and produce an inspiring environment. For that to work, it’s hugely important that you show your appreciation on an individual basis.  Last tip: whenever you receive a reward, don’t take it for granted – otherwise, that’ll be your last reward! The key message in this book: If you want to build a successful organization, don’t waste your time coddling underperformers. Instead, make high achievers your priority: these top workers are the ones bringing speed, creativity and energy into your organization. And if you can keep them motivated, they’ll be the backbone of your organization.  Actionable advice: Credibility is everything.  If you want to play a significant role in any kind of organization, you must be credible. Otherwise, people won’t feel that they can rely on you to do what’s best for the team. And the thing is, once you lose your credibility, it’s almost impossible to gain it back. That’s why you should always honor your commitments and take responsibility for your mistakes.

Some of us also experience a more severe anxiety such as worrying a lot or having a phobia. However, these things don’t usually keep us from leading a “normal” life. In extreme cases, there is clinical anxiety. Those who suffer from clinical anxiety are scared of things that aren’t intrinsically dangerous (like public speaking) and have extreme reactions to them, such as vomiting or fainting. In these blinks, you’ll discover: Theories on the cause of anxiety; How everyday actions can become almost impossible for those who are clinically anxious; How anxiety got the author into embarrassing situations, like flooding the Kennedy family’s bathroom. Most us would agree that anxiety is fairly normal. However, few people are aware that clinical anxiety is actually the most common form of mental illness. It is diagnosed even more often than depression, and one out of six people worldwide will be clinically anxious for at least one year in their lifetime. In addition, anxiety seems to be a characteristic that defies the boundaries of both culture and time. For instance, in Spanish-speaking South America anxiety is referred to as “ataques de nervios,” Greenland Inuit call it “kayak angst” and Iranians talk about “heart distress.” However it’s labeled, these terms all refer to a common state. Clinical anxiety not only shows up across countries and cultures, but is also not tied to any particular era and has been discussed in documents throughout history. For instance, Plato and Hippocrates had their theories about the disease, Spinoza wrote of it, and Sigmund Freud was preoccupied with finding and defining the mechanisms of anxiety. It is important to note that anxiety is not a weakness of character. In fact, some argue that anxiety is actually the motor of civilization, creativity and inventive genius. Indeed, many people noted for their success and influence such as Gandhi, Charles Darwin and Barbra Streisand have struggled with anxiety. Along with these well-known and respected personalities, some 40 million Americans have also been diagnosed with the illness. With such an astounding statistic, it would be absurd to call all of these people “insane.” Far from being a “crazy” person who cannot succeed in life, the author himself is a successful journalist and editor who can provide for his family and raise children despite his chronic anxiety. So it is evident that clinical anxiety is a universal illness to which no one is really immune. So what is it like to live with anxiety? Life with anxiety is a constant battle. Some people compare it to living with diabetes, insofar as the anxious have to handle painful inflictions every day. Like the diabetic who has to constantly monitor blood sugar levels and inject insulin, a clinically anxious person must perpetually watch out for stressful situations and be ever-ready to drug themselves for relief. Sadly, being anxious is a dramatic limitation to ones everyday life – many anxious people are housebound, often preferring to stay home in order to feel safe and in control. For example, one clinically anxious man wasn’t able to walk within a five-kilometer radius around his house without vomiting blood uncontrollably. Some of life’s basic demands are almost impossible for an anxious person to fulfill. For instance, the author is not able to get on an airplane or speak in public without consuming a concoction of medication and alcohol. Attachment is another serious issue for anxious people, as they tend to get overly attached to their loved ones. For example, as a child, the author couldn’t stand to be separated from his parents and when they were gone he would call their friends, convinced that his parents had died. Another struggle faced by anxious people is that their behavior is often unpredictable and embarrassing. For instance, when traveling in a foreign town, the author visited nearly all of the sanitary facilities but none of the actual sights, because he was so wracked with nerves. The author also once had the opportunity to visit the Kennedy family. Unfortunately, due to his sensitive stressed-out bowels, he ended up clogging their toilet, and leaving the entire bathroom flooded. There are different theories on what causes anxiety. Psychoanalysts, for example, believe anxiety derives from the repression of taboo thoughts that first arise during childhood. Take, for example, Freud’s Oedipus complex theory. Freud believed that boys sexually desire their mother and envy their father, while girls desire their father and envy their mother. These sexual or envious thoughts are never acted out, because the child is scared of being punished for thinking them. As a result the thoughts persist and are projected onto an object that causes the child to feel anxious. Freud himself believed that his own phobia of trains originated from seeing his mother naked on a train when he was a child, and desiring her. However, the Oedipus complex is now deemed an outdated theory. Another theory looks specifically at mother–child relationships. Specifically, it is thought that children who endure longer separations from their mothers tend to become anxious. One study on Rhesus monkeys showed that those that were separated from their mothers suffered from long-term effects like anxiety, in addition to aggression and social abnormality in adulthood. The way a mother interacts with her child seems to be of particular importance in determining how anxious the child will become in stressful situations. For example, one experiment showed that a child whose mother is mindful, caring and loving behaves less anxiously in new situations (for example, when a stranger enters a room and the mother leaves) than a child whose mother acts ambivalently and anxiously herself. So what could have caused Freud’s anxiety? Well, it could be explained by the fact that his mother became depressed after his brother died and stopped taking care of her older son. The author, too, had an anxious and phobic mother and this may have influenced his own anxiety. Therefore it appears that the way a child is raised has a considerable influence on its future behavior and level of anxiety. Although it is not easy to live with, anxiety is not necessarily a deficit or a disadvantage. It is in fact an evolutionary adaptation that can be found in our genes. According to the “survival of the fittest” theory, we are programmed to be anxious toward dangerous things, since someone who is afraid of a threat such as a snake or a high cliff is more likely to survive than someone who is not. Therefore these phobias are easily developed because they were useful fears in the past. However, clinically anxious people are afraid of things that aren’t intrinsically dangerous and the potency of their anxiety does not make evolutionary sense. Take the author’s phobia of cheese, for instance. Clearly this not adaptive, nor useful. It has also been found that the chance of being clinically anxious increases with certain genes. Higher levels of anxiety can already be observed a few weeks after birth, which indicates a genetic facet to the illness. Studies have shown that 15 to 20 percent of infants are significantly more anxious than others only a short time after birth. Studies also show that these infants become very anxious when they reach adulthood. The author also notices some genetic link between his anxiety and his daughter’s anxiety, given that she even shares the same phobias, despite her parents raising her in a loving, caring manner. Which genes are responsible for anxiety, then? Well, scientists have been able to identify some of them. The stathmin gene, for example, provides the ability to feel fear. When this is removed from mice, they no longer show fear. There is also a correlation between variants of a gene called RGS2 and people who are highly anxious. So we can see that a certain amount of anxiety ensures ones survival. However, some people are overly anxious and this may be caused by their genes. So we have seen how anxiety came about through evolution and how it can be passed on genetically. Now let’s take a look at the physiology of the condition and how it may be influenced by drugs. First, we know that anxiety is created in the brain. Thanks to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain scans, we can observe that anxiety is linked to hyperactivity in certain brain areas. This hyperactivity can be seen in the frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex when worry about future events is triggered, whereas increased activity in the anterior cingulate is linked to fear of public speaking. Aside from knowing where clinical anxiety occurs, we also know that it derives from a defective neurotransmitter system in the brain. Specifically, clinically anxious people produce less serotonin (a neurotransmitter that regulates emotions such as satisfaction and happiness) than normally anxious people. So what can we do with these findings? Well, we can look into drug treatment. Medication is one way to treat anxiety, but it is not for everyone. Anti-anxiety drugs work by influencing neurotransmitters in the brain. The drug Xanax works by binding to GABA neurotransmitters that inhibit the activity of the central nervous system, which has a calming effect. Drugs are a popular option for clinical anxiety sufferers. In 2005 alone, there were 53 million prescriptions for Ativan and Xanax. However, medication is controversial as there are severe side effects, risk of addiction and theories that certain drugs aren’t any more effective than placebos. Surprisingly, a 2003 study showed that only one out of three patients actually felt better after taking anti-anxiety drugs. As for addiction, the author himself became addicted to anti-anxiety drugs, including Xanax and Paxil. He once tried to go without them but found the experience unbearable, and as a result returned to medication after just one week. We have seen how medication functions in the brain. However, there are also alternative treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT, which we will look at below. CBT is based on the theory that there are behaviors (like anxious behavior), that can’t be controlled through rational thinking. The most common approach used in CBT is exposure therapy. This involves a patient having to directly face what he or she fears in order to learn that there is no actual threat present in the feared object. For example, the author himself suffers from emetophobia – the pathological fear of vomiting. In an attempt to treat this, he once tried exposure therapy. As part of the exposure, he had to take emetics to induce vomiting. Unfortunately, this ended in disaster, and rather than vomiting from the emetic, he ended up choking. Cognitive behavioral therapists also believe in getting to the source of anxiety and that this is often hidden in the patient’s mind. The author’s therapist used what is known as imaginal exposure, believing that there was something more existential that caused his anxiety. In therapy sessions, the author had to list a hierarchy of things that scared him, then picture those things and tell the doctor what he was feeling. On one occasion, the author started crying without really knowing why. However, the doctor believed that they were on the right path to finding an explanation for the author’s anxiety. To this day, the author is still fighting his anxiety with drugs and CBT. Although there seems to be no universal cure for anxiety, there are certainly ways to reduce its intensity. The author hoped that this book would help him with that. The key message in this book: Clinical anxiety is a more common and more severe illness than one might think. However, there are many different ways to reduce and treat the condition. It is important to note that even when a sufferer’s anxiety is not always under full control, it doesn’t mean that a life with anxiety is a poor life.","headers":["What’s in it for me: Find out what it is really like to suffer from clinical anxiety.","Clinical anxiety is the most common form of mental illness.","Anxiety is a disease that makes one’s life hard, stressful and embarrassing.","The cause of anxiety might be determined in childhood.","Anxiety is an evolutionary adaptation and is inherited through genetics.","Anxiety is a product of the body and can therefore be influenced by drugs.","Therapy can also be valuable in treating anxiety.","Final summary"],"category":"Personal Growth","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/5398598d3163350007190000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"This book offers a candid, valuable glimpse into the world of the clinically anxious.

So what do these self-starters all have in common? They’ve all developed a morning regimen that helps them start the day in the best possible way. But these blinks don’t lay down inflexible rules for you to dogmatically apply to your life. Rather, they offer brilliant and unique ideas designed to inspire you to carry out your own experiments and craft a morning routine that suits your needs. So dive in and find out what kind of morning is most likely to boost your productivity and happiness. From artists who rise at the crack of dawn to record their dreams and CEOs who swear by half an hour’s meditation to Olympic athletes who can’t do without an early morning workout, there are plenty of examples to fire your imagination! In these blinks, you find out why a good night’s sleep sets you up for success; how to build a morning routine around your children; and why working out is as good for your mental health as it is for your body. You know the scene. The alarm starts ringing and you drowsily fumble in the dark to switch it off. All you want is a little more sleep. But mornings don’t have to be miserable moments of resentfully hauling yourself out of bed. One way to make sure you start the day bright-eyed and bushy-tailed is to have an important task ahead of you.   Take MIT president Leo Rafael Reif. He sets his alarm for 6:00 a.m., but he’s usually already up a good 30 or even 60 minutes before it rings. Why does he forgo the extra sleep? Well, he wants to make sure he’s had a gander at his inbox before the day gets going. That’s because MIT is a truly global institution. As its president, Reif needs to stay in the loop and make sure he’s up to speed on the latest developments. If he’s not up at the crack of dawn, he worries he’ll miss something important. But you don’t have to be the head of a large organization to give yourself a good reason to jump out of bed each morning. Knowing that something you really care about awaits you is just as good of a boost once the proverbial rooster starts crowing.   Take a leaf out of author Caroline Paul’s book. She’s also an early riser. Like Reif, she’s usually up by 6:00 a.m. What gets her out of bed? It’s the chance to spend a couple of hours reading in peace before the rest of the world begins to make itself felt. Reading isn’t just her bread and butter; it’s something she loves doing. Mornings are an oasis of calm in a hectic life, and it’s often the only chance she gets to engross herself in a good book. New York-based street photographer Andre Wagner also uses mornings to pursue his passion. He’s usually out of the house no later than 7:00 or 7:30 a.m. It’s a great time to walk the city and capture the early morning light with his camera.   But there’s also a simple trick that’ll help you get a good start: don’t use the snooze button on your alarm. The authors’ interviews with successful early risers showed that while 71 percent used an alarm, only 34 percent made use of the snooze function. There’s a good reason for that. Grabbing a few extra minutes of sleep might feel like what your body needs, but in the end, you’ll feel more tired than if you’d just gotten up when your alarm first rang. Think of it this way. Lightly slumbering is akin to revving a car engine without putting it into gear; both activities are a waste of gas. The most important tip, however, is to follow your own instincts. Experiment and see what works for you. Something that does the trick for other people might not work for you. If you realize it doesn’t, don’t be afraid to abandon it and try something else. Whether it’s a big work project or something more personal, you probably have a whole list of things you keep meaning to get around to but never seem to find the time for. There simply doesn’t seem to be enough hours in the day, right? Well, there are – you just need to snatch them in the morning. That’s often the time you’ll end up doing your most important work. Take Sheena Brady. She gets up early, so she’ll have time for her own company, Tease Tea, to which she dedicates the hours between 7:00 and 11:00, before spending the rest of the working day at Shopify. The author and public speaker Todd Henry finds mornings similarly rewarding. After he stopped trying to cram everything into the first part of his day, he created time and space to tackle the work which is most important to him – studying and writing. Mornings, he claims, are there for precisely that. Making the right start is key if you really want to get to the vital things. One way of doing that is to avoid beginning the day by checking your emails. Author Ryan Holiday aims to make sure he does at least one other task before opening his inbox. In his case, that’s writing, but you could also try other things – taking a shower, say, or going for a run. Shane Parrish, the founder of the Farnam Street blog, also adheres to this rule. He stopped checking his emails in the morning, after noticing how it let others dictate the course of his day. It’s a nifty trick. Responding to emails is, after all, reactive, whereas your morning activities should be proactive. It’s the time to take care of your own needs and schedule your day. A great way of setting your own agenda for the day is to write down a to-do list. Take Geoff Colvin, senior editor at Fortune magazine. Every morning, he sits down and writes out a list of what he wants to accomplish that day. Once he’s got his itinerary down on paper, he starts working through the tasks, beginning with the most important. But it’s also a good idea to take all this advice with a pinch of salt. Author Chris Guillebeau, for example, finds that starting his day by reading his emails suits him perfectly! Which brings us to our next blink – workout routines. Let’s not beat around the bush. Exercise is good for you. That’s something the authors’ interviewees have noticed, too – and acted on. Seventy-nine percent of them work out every day. Exercise isn’t just about toning your abs or getting into shape; indeed, it’s as good for the mind as it is for the body. Take the American Olympic swimmer and bronze medalist Caroline Burckle. She gets up at 5:30 every morning and hits the gym first thing. That’s part and parcel of the life of an athlete, but there’s more to it than that. Getting her body moving, she says, is her way of meditating. Sherry Lansing, the former president of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, admits that she occasionally skips her workout routine. That’s unavoidable sometimes. But there’s a good reason to make a concerted effort to stick to your exercise regimen. As Lansing says, when she makes working out the most important part of her morning routine, she feels on top of the world for the rest of the day. That said, you shouldn’t overexert yourself. Alternating exercises from one day to the next can prevent injuries and keep you interested and focused. Take a look at Lansing’s routine. Mondays and Wednesdays are for Pilates; Tuesdays and Thursdays are spent running on a treadmill for an hour and a half followed by weightlifting. Retired US army general Stanley McChrystal has a similar setup. A man who clearly believes that the early bird catches the worm, he gets up at 4:00 a.m. for his daily hour-and-a-half workout session. Mixing it up is a key part of his approach. That’s why he alternates between running and weight training. He noticed the benefits of that after abandoning his old habit of running the same distance every single morning. Getting started can seem daunting. It’s easy to set overly ambitious targets and end up feeling guilty because you haven’t met them. But remember: you can also start with something small and gradually increase the strenuousness of your workout routine over time. A good way of getting going is to build exercise into your preexisting routine. You could do a set of jumping jacks while you wait for your coffee to brew, for example. Julie Zhuo, the vice president of product design at Facebook, has a simple yet effective way of incorporating a workout session into her day. Rather than hitting the gym across town, she aims to spend between ten and 15 minutes on her cross-trainer each day. Because that’s not a massive amount of time, the stakes remain low. That means working out becomes as natural as brushing her teeth in the morning. Planning around your fitness regimen is another way to set yourself up for success. Take Kevin Cleary, the CEO of Clif Bar & Company. He sits down every Sunday to plan his workout routine around his work and family commitments. By resisting the temptation to set his exercise plans in stone, he frees himself up to take a more pragmatic approach. And that means he’s less likely to cancel or postpone an individual session. It’s easy to dismiss meditation as a fad, especially if you’ve never tried it. But there must be a reason over half of the authors’ interviewees regularly meditate, right? The reason so many of them swear by it is that it’s a great way to start your day. Take Michael Acton Smith, the CEO of the meditation app Calm. He heads a group meditation session at the company’s headquarters every morning. As he himself admits, that sounds dreadfully “Californian,” but it’s actually a great way to kick off the working day. Aiste Gazdar, the founder of the London-based Wild Food Cafe, agrees. Early morning meditation sessions are the most important part of her day. They’re moments of calm in which she can confront her concerns about what lies ahead. Once she’s done that, the rest of the day just falls into place.    In fact, some people are so devoted to meditating on a daily basis that they make sure they never miss a single session. The president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, Ed Catmull, meditates for around 30 to 60 minutes every day and hasn’t gone a day without doing so for years. He says that slowing down and focusing his mind sets him up to respond calmly to unexpected events. Novelist and teacher Ruth Ozeki places a similar premium on meditation. Although her schedule changes throughout the year depending on what she’s doing at any given time, she always makes time to meditate. That’s hardly surprising – she is a Zen Buddhist priest, after all. So whether she has a hectic day of teaching or a more relaxed writing day ahead of her, she meditates before doing anything else – well, almost. There is time to enjoy a cup of coffee in bed! If that sounds good, you might be wondering where to start. Meditation is all about being mindful of your surroundings and being in the moment, so a good place to jump in is by focusing your mind on mundane moments like making yourself coffee or tea in the morning. Whatever it is that you’re doing, once you’re fully focused on the task at hand, you’re already meditating. So far, we’ve focused on using morning routines to boost your productivity. But you shouldn’t neglect the person engaging in those routines – you. In fact, carving out some me time is another great way of setting yourself up for the day. Taking a moment to do things that are important to you gives you a head start on the day. And, when things begin getting a little more hectic, you’ll already be well-positioned to take them in stride. That’s what Melody McCloskey, CEO of StyleSeat, does. After getting up at 5:45 a.m., she spends the next hour or so tidying up or dealing with personal and work-related issues. By the time everyone else is up and about, she’s already firmly in her groove. And that makes her both more productive and happier for the rest of the day. But it isn’t just chores that you can make extra time for. Taking a moment to focus on anything that you value can boost your creative output. Take the artist Elle Luna. The very first thing she does upon waking is to record her dreams using a dictaphone. Dreams both provide her with an insight into her subconscious mind and serve as a source of creative inspiration. Often, she uses her recordings to help her paint her dreams. You can also follow the example of illustrator and instructor Yuko Shimizu. She takes the slow train to work to allow for five extra minutes of reading time. Whatever it is you want to do with the extra time you’ve freed up, it’s important not to dive straight into work. Slowing down your morning routine has a calming influence on the rest of the day and prevents you from becoming swamped. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at how to prepare for a great morning the evening before. You might think that morning routines are all about, well, mornings. But setting yourself up for a great start to the day is something you can actually begin planning the previous evening. A good night’s sleep is key. So how do you go about ensuring you get enough rest to start bright and early? In a word, by disconnecting. That means switching off your technological connections to the world as early as you can each evening. Take the best-selling author and entrepreneur Nir Eyal. He installed a special router that automatically cuts off his connection to the internet at around ten each evening. That means he’s usually tucked up in bed no later than eleven. Author and podcast host David Kadavy has a similar approach. He turns off the screens in his home at ten and sleeps with blue-blocker goggles to prevent LCD screens interfering with his sleep. If he’s not ready for bed, he avoids social media and instead does something quiet like reading a book. Emails are another disturbance that can prevent you winding down in the evenings. That’s why author and public speaker Jenny Blake simply doesn’t check her inbox after 5:00 p.m. It’s a technique that makes for a relaxing evening and leaves her feeling refreshed and ready to conquer the world the next morning. Reflection and quietly mulling over the course of your day can also help you disconnect and depressurize. When she hits the sack, Jenny Blake asks herself what the highlights and low points of her day were. Thinking about what she can be proud of or grateful for helps her unwind and clear her mind. Once she’s done that, she falls asleep in the blink of an eye. Math teacher and author José Luis Vilson also swears by the benefits of unwinding. His trick? A soothing cup of chamomile tea before bed. Truly disconnecting is, however, sometimes easier said than done. But little details can make all the difference. Take Bob Moore, the founder of the health-food company Bob’s Red Mill. Every evening, he lays out the clothes he plans on wearing the next day, which makes his mornings a whole lot less complicated. If you’re having a tough time getting out of bed and making a start on the day ahead, there’s usually a pretty obvious culprit – a bad night’s sleep. Sticking to a consistent bedtime can be tricky, but it’s something to strive for. After all, the amount of rest you’ve had has a greater effect on your mornings than anything else. But it’s not just your morning routine that stands to benefit from you getting a proper night’s sleep. Adequate sleep is vital to your whole sense of well-being. That’s something Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington learned the hard way. At one point, she became so sleep-deprived that she ended up fainting and breaking her cheekbone on a desk! That was the moment she decided to make some much-needed changes to her lifestyle. Today, she tries to always get eight hours of sleep, and, in order to achieve that target, heads bedward at 11:00 every night. In fact, she manages her sleep so well now that she doesn’t even need an alarm. Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic, also builds his day around getting the right amount of sleep. In his case, that means getting up as early as he can – mornings are when he’s most productive – and making sure he’s tucked up in bed by 11:00 p.m. That’s important, he says, because sleep deprivation slows your mind down. By his estimation, tiredness can knock a good ten points off your IQ score. That means it might be time to stop using an alarm to get you out of the land of Nod. At least, that’s what venture capitalist Brad Feld did. For years, he’d get up at 5:00 a.m. on weekdays, no matter where he was in the world, and he spend his weekends “catching up” on missed sleep. Unfortunately for Feld, this less-than-healthy routine resulted in a major depressive episode. After reaching that low, he changed his habits. Now he makes sure he’s getting the sleep he needs by simply slumbering away until his body is ready to wake up, which might be as early as 5:30 or as late as 9:00 a.m. So, you can see how important it is to get the right amount of sleep. Going to bed early or waking up a bit later are both options. But even if you can’t manage that, you can try to develop a consistent pattern and catch up later. If you’ve already found your perfect morning routine before having children, you’re likely to be in for a rude awakening – literally! Once you become a parent, the pattern that used to prepare you for the day ahead will probably no longer fit your life. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. Children thrive on routine just as much as adults do. The key is to make changes to your regimen so that it also works for your kids. A good way to start is with the realization that your children are alarm clocks. They’ll determine when you wake up with greater precision than your phone ever could.   Nick Bilton, a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, says he used to wake up at around 6:00 a.m. to get some work done. Now, however, he’s awakened by his toddler every morning at 5:30. That’s the new pattern. And even if the kids sleep later than usual, his dog is always on hand to make sure he’s up. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone reports a similar experience. His five-year-old wakes him between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m. each morning. That’s a cannily chosen time; it leaves exactly an hour for playtime. So if you’re a parent who wants to get something done in the morning, you’ll need to be up and about before your kids. Washington State attorney general Bob Ferguson wakes up between 5:00 and 6:30 a.m., for example. That gives him anywhere between one and two and a half hours of personal time before his twins wake up at 7:30 a.m. Whatever routine you end up choosing, remember that the most important thing is to enjoy your family time once you’re all awake. That’s especially important if, like Ferguson, you’re likely to be working late in the evenings. Whether you’re on holiday or a business trip, travel means being in new surroundings that probably lack the little creature comforts that help define your usual morning routine. That can quickly undo familiar patterns. But there are steps you can take to help you keep control of the morning. The first tip is to try to maintain at least some elements of your routine. Take model and activist Cameron Russell. She’s constantly on the road due to her work, and that’s changed the way she thinks about “routine.” For her, it’s more like an improvised attempt to fit the things she values into a hectic travel schedule; this entails a lot of adaptation and improvisation. Wherever she finds herself, she always makes time to do a little reading. That might mean skimming a few pages in the back of a cab or while sitting in the makeup chair; no matter her surroundings, though, she can’t do without this inspiring and wonderful start to the day. There are also more minimalistic solutions. Venture capitalist M. G. Siegler, for example, simply has a bottled Starbucks Frappuccino. Because the chain is nearly everywhere, he can do that whether he’s at home or abroad. But you don’t need to rely on being able to replicate your routine in every setting – in fact, there’s a lot to be said for adapting your morning ritual to wherever you currently are. That’s what Peter Balyta, president of education technology at Texas Instruments Inc., does. Using his scientific and mathematical skills, he devises a special workout routine tailored to his local surroundings. Whether it’s a jog along the Great Wall of China, applying physics know-how to leverage himself around a barbell or doing plyometric exercises using his hotel-room furniture, he’s constantly adapting his routine to what’s around him. Travel can have an adverse effect on morning routines, but remember, with a little inventiveness and flexibility, you should be able to keep up at least some of your early-hour habits. And if travel ends up knocking you off kilter, don’t worry – it happens to all of us! Just try to pick up where you left off once you’re back home. The world is an unpredictable place. That means there’ll always be some mornings where forces beyond your control end up throwing you off course and upsetting your tried-and-true morning routine. But that doesn’t have to ruin your whole day. Forewarned is forearmed. If you’re prepared for disruption, you’ll be in a much better position to go with the flow and keep your eye on the prize. Take the junior doctor Rumana Lasker Dawood. Her routine is built around disruptions. Being disrupted, after all, is what working in a hospital inevitably involves. Shifts change on a daily basis, and relocations to new specialist wards occur every half year or so. She can’t establish a regular wake-up time or plan around a definite set of daily tasks. For her, these things vary.   But she doesn’t let that throw her off course. Her demanding job has taught her to expect the unexpected and prepare accordingly. Taking events in her stride and making rapid readjustments is her routine. In fact, there’s a good case to be made that embracing adaptability and flexibility can actually help you. Look at author Austin Kleon. He’s learned to enjoy the days when his routine is disturbed; indeed, he regards such disturbances as an interesting break from his habitual schedule. Leo Babauta, the founder of the Zen Habits blog, takes this flexible approach to its logical conclusion and simply abandons routine altogether in favor of a morning ritual that emphasizes mindfulness. But, of course, you can’t diverge from or do away with your routine unless you establish one. And when developing your routine, the most important thing to remember is that it should suit your needs. Ana Marie Cox, a columnist and culture critic who has had to battle with depression, sums this up by noting that sometimes just getting out of bed can be something to be proud of. Your goal isn’t to please anyone else and end up feeling guilty if you fall short of the targets you’ve set; it’s to design a morning routine that helps you start the day well and achieve your own ambitions. The key message in these blinks: What do 64 of today’s most successful people have in common? They have a solid morning routine that sets them up for the day ahead. That’s where the similarities end, though. Every self-starter interviewed in this book has a unique morning regimen, from writing to working out to meditating. The key to developing your own morning routine isn’t any one technique or activity; it’s doing what works best for you. Actionable advice: Start right! Getting the first few hours of your day right has a dramatic effect on what comes later. You can end up feeling happier, more relaxed and ready to conquer the world. So where do you start? The best answer is by following your instincts and sticking to what feels right. Getting up at 6:00 a.m. to do an hour of meditation might sound like nirvana to some; for others, it’s more likely to be another reason to pull the duvet over their head and return to sleep. The key to successfully crafting your morning regimen is experimentation. Try out the ideas in these blinks that you like the sound of. If it feels good, stick to it. If it doesn’t, try something else. You’re sure to find your own unique combination soon enough! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

One reason his advice continues to attract readers is that he didn’t believe you had to be born with natural talent to succeed in life. In Hill’s estimations, with a little determination and hard work, anyone can develop the skills needed to reach his goals and be a success in his field. Many of Hill’s techniques come down to how you think. If you want to get ahead in life, considering yourself unworthy of good fortune and thinking defeatist thoughts isn’t going to cut it. But it’s not just positive thinking that Hill teaches. As you’ll hear in the blinks ahead, when you put your thoughts to work, you can develop new skills and helpful habits that will bring energy and action into your everyday life. In these blinks you’ll find out how to make it easier to wake up when you want to; how a vivid imagination can lead to better public speaking skills; and how a chocolate eclair can help you remember someone’s name. Have you ever met someone who exudes total self-confidence and seems to succeed at everything she turns her hand to? Maybe you think she comes across as cocky, or you feel jealous that she seems to know the secrets to success and you don’t. But here’s the thing: we can all create the life we want. The secret is simply how we use our thoughts. One powerful method is through autosuggestion, which allows you to shape how you develop as an individual by feeding your mind inspiring thoughts and images. The author had a regular practice of thinking up imaginary meetings where he’d sit down and chat with such distinguished and inspiring guests as Abraham Lincoln, Socrates, Napoleon and Aristotle. During these imaginary meetings, Hill would focus on certain characteristics of his guests that he hoped to make his own. In Lincoln’s case, he hoped to take on his ability to be fair, to help others and to be courageous in finding new ways of doing things. Every night, Hill would spend an hour performing this exercise, adding more inspiring figures to his meetings as he would learn about them. He found that by using autosuggestion to focus on inspiring thoughts, you can transform your life and find success. In Hill’s case, autosuggestion allowed him to overcome his fear of public speaking and focus on taking on the qualities of successful orators, such as the abolitionist clergyman, Henry Ward Beecher. After just a week’s worth of autosuggestion, Hill received a standing ovation and a return invitation after one highly successful speech. A year later, he was touring the country as one of the most sought-after speakers in the US. He even received an award for his 1920 speech at a convention in Pittsburgh from the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World. And it was all made possible by the power of thought. Difficult problems require creative solutions. Yet, when it comes to developing these great ideas, there are two difficulties: one is developing the idea, the other is convincing people how great it is. Often, the latter problem is the hardest to solve. If you want to improve your skills in convincing others, then your best teacher isn’t a guru or businessman – it’s the poet and playwright William Shakespeare. In his play Julius Caesar, we can see how the path to changing someone’s mind starts by taking his side. During Caesar's funeral, Marc Antony attempts to change the minds of those in attendance to see his friend Caesar as a great man. Quite a challenge, since the first person to address the crowd is Brutus – the man who killed Caesar – who gives an impassioned speech that convinces everyone of how evil Caesar was. Once Brutus has finished, it’s Marc Antony’s turn to speak. He knows he can’t accomplish his task by immediately forcing his position upon the crowd and contradicting what Brutus said, so he starts off by praising Brutus and agreeing that Caesar should be forgotten. This allows Marc Antony to quickly get the crowd on his side. He then starts to feed his audience new ideas, such as how much Caesar did for the population of Rome – he even wrote in his will that he wanted his riches to go to the Roman people! Slowly but surely, Marc Antony’s praise for Brutus changes from genuine, to ironic and finally damning. Eventually, Marc Antony is able to completely change the mood of the crowd, so much so that they condemn Brutus for killing Caesar and run him out of Rome. Such a technique can be easily transferred to the professional world. The author once watched this method used to great effect by a lawyer who was a student of Shakespearean texts. When he began to address the jury, he didn’t do so by attacking his opponent. Instead, he listed all the positive remarks the opposing side made and agreed that they made good points. In doing so, he gained the jury’s attention and confidence, at which point he began to list all the flaws in the opponent’s case. Needless to say, he prevailed at trial without much difficulty. If you think back on your life, can you recall a time when you felt properly motivated after being harshly criticized or humiliated? Probably not, because if you want someone to do something the best way is through positive reinforcement. In other words, if you want to improve the work performance of your employees, you need to use positive suggestions, not negative ones. The author knew a manager who never criticized his workers. Instead, he would walk through the offices and compliment each worker, one at a time, for their great work. While doing so, he would always make the subtle suggestion that they could do even better if they tried. On one occasion, the manager had to deal with an employee whose efficiency had taken a nosedive in recent weeks. But here too, it was positive suggestion that worked. The manager knew that criticizing him for the dip in efficiency would only demoralize the employee. So he put his hand on the employee’s shoulder and told him that he was impressed at how the pace of his work had improved and that it was setting an excellent example for the other employees. Remarkably, by the end of that very same day, the employee’s efficiency rose by 25 percent. If you’re a salesperson, you’ll find it extremely easy to experience the benefit of positive suggestion. For example, make it part of your sales pitch: when introducing the customer to a product, mention that even though it’s a new product, she’ll surely recognize how useful it is due to its numerous features. This way, the customer won’t think that you’re trying to convince her of anything. Instead, you’ll be subtly suggesting that not only is the product of high quality, but it was her idea to come to this conclusion, not yours. Finally, the power of positive suggestion can also lead to improvements in your health. Hill knew a doctor who could convince ailing patients that their health was improving. Sure enough, many patients suffering from illnesses such as pneumonia were convinced by his positive suggestions and begin to recover. When you think about “praying” for something, your first thought might be to pray for the strength to be more virtuous, or for someone else to get well. But prayer can also be used for more practical things, such as an improvement in your business performance. To use prayer, you don’t have to believe in any particular faith, or that one god is better than another. As far as Hill is concerned, when you pray, it just means you’re sending a thought out into the universe, and this thought can act like a wave of electricity – influencing the well-being of your business or whatever it is your prayer might be about. Once, when Hill was negotiating a business deal, the offer he’d made to a potential new business partner ended up being turned down. So he sent out a prayer that he would change his mind and accept the offer. And wouldn’t you know it, two minutes after he prayed, that’s precisely what happened. Another tool that can benefit your business is the law of retaliation, which states that people will act toward you as you act toward them. It might sound simple – and it is – but it’s also one of the most effective ways to find success. With this principle, you can get anyone to do just about anything you want, so long as you do something for him first. If you want someone to give you something, for example, give him something first. Let’s say a boy and his friend are having lunch in the playground, and one boy tries to take a snack away from the other without asking. Chances are, the only thing that greedy boy is going to get is a punch in the arm. But what happens if the boy starts by offering one of his own snacks to his friend? The friend will likely offer the boy a snack without even being asked. This schoolyard transaction applies to adult business as well. If you want your more successful colleagues to recommend you to one of their business partners, the first thing you can do is make a point of speaking highly of that colleague to some of your contacts. Many people go through life with two main goals: material wealth and happiness. The good news is, you can attain both of these with just one characteristic: self-confidence. How important is self-confidence? Well, to start with, you’ll never be happy without it, because if you hope to gain the things you want in life, you first need to believe that you deserve those things, and that takes self-confidence. You can work day and night, seven days a week, but without self-confidence, you’ll never make the big bucks since that’s what it takes to jump at an opportunity, take chances and be innovative. So, how do you develop self-confidence? It’s all about realizing that your life and happiness are in your hands and no one else’s. You need to start taking full responsibility for your life and appreciating that the buck stops with you. Once you stop believing that other people are responsible for your fortune – or misfortune – you can start to see that you are the key to your own success. When this happens, you’ll find that you have access to an endless source of energy and vitality that will allow you to reach your most challenging goals. To help facilitate this shift in understanding, use affirmations. An affirmation is simply a positive thought that you can repeat and focus on until it becomes a reality. Some powerful affirmations include: “I know that I can accomplish anything I set out to do. I know that if I truly believe this, and act accordingly, success will be mine.” “I know that whatever I think eventually takes a material form in the physical world, which is why I can think my way to success. Every day I will think of the person I want to be, until the image is so detailed that it can become reality.” “From now on, I will start by planning exactly what I want to do, and then I will focus entirely on this plan until it has become reality.” If you practice these affirmations every day, you’re sure to see both your confidence and your life improve. You won’t get far if you give up on a project at the first sign of trouble. If you want to turn an idea into a successful business, it’s going to take persistence. If you feel you lack the willpower to stick with a task when it starts to get unpleasant, here’s some more good news: there’s a simple process for developing habits which will keep you persistent in achieving success. Developing new and helpful habits is a terrific way to reach your goals without having to rely so much on willpower. If your current habit is to sleep until noon and shuffle through the day in a sleepy haze, it’ll take significant willpower to suddenly start getting up at six in the morning. But you can turn your 6 a.m. wake-up call into a habit by repeating it often enough, thereby making it an ingrained part of your everyday life. Before long, you won’t even have to try to wake up early – it’ll just happen naturally without any willpower required. Using this technique can fill your day with positive habits, such as starting the day bright and early, exercising, reading to learn new skills and always jumping at the chance to make a new business contact. It might sound like a lot now, but engaging with these habits will leave you energized and with a surplus of willpower that you can put to use doing good and successful work. When in the difficult early stages of forming a new habit, autosuggestion can help. After all, if you’re relying solely on your alarm clock to get you out of bed at 6 a.m., there’s a good chance you’ll turn the alarm off, roll over and go back to sleep. Here’s how the addition of autosuggestion can come in handy: Several times a day, take a few minutes to imagine yourself waking up feeling energized, well-rested and with the ability to spring right out of bed. When visualizing this process, picture every detail. Maybe you start by yawning, then stretching your arms before getting up and out of bed. With the help of autosuggestion, this process will make its way from your thoughts to your body, and waking up early will soon be a daily, effortless habit. It’s no coincidence that the students who go to the best schools tend to become our leading researchers, politicians and artists. Like the rest of us, they’re shaped by their environment, and in the case of a world-class school, shaped into world-class professionals. Whether you realize it or not, you’re constantly being influenced by your environment and surroundings, since what you’re exposed to everyday impacts your thoughts, and your thoughts play a huge factor in determining what occurs in your life. When you consider this, it only makes sense that you choose carefully the right environment that’ll help you achieve the goals you’ve set for yourself. If you hope to be a successful business executive, then it makes sense to live near other successful business executives, or at least spend time at clubs or places where they socialize. The best environment for you to be in is one surrounded by people who share your goals in life or career, and to avoid being around people with negative or defeatist attitudes. When you know what you want to achieve, picture each and every detail about what your perfectly supportive environment will look like. Once you have that image in mind, it’s time to go out and find it. Unfortunately, there are aspects of our society where people are being harmed by their environment, and we should work to fix this. In particular, the prison system has a horrible and corrupting influence on those behind bars. Most are confined to small spaces with other criminals, giving them little or no opportunity to rehabilitate, educate themselves or experience anything besides routine violence. Under these conditions, there’s little chance of an inmate reforming himself. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We could place criminals into clean, healthy, safe environments, where the focus is on the development of new skills which will allow them to be successful contributors to society. Imagine the amount of criminal activity we could wipe out! Here’s an all too familiar scenario: You’re at a party, and you notice someone familiar approaching you with a smile and a friendly greeting. She knows your name, but you’re drawing a blank and can’t seem to recall hers, or where it was you met her. Oh, the awkwardness! While this kind of unfortunate embarrassment can make networking a challenge, the good news here is that a faulty memory can be strengthened. There are three steps to recharging your memory bank. First is to start paying attention. If you’re always daydreaming while meeting new people, you shouldn’t be surprised when you forget someone’s name at a later date. Likewise, if you’re not paying attention to where you parked your car and which roads you go down, you’re bound to have trouble finding your way back later on. Start paying better attention by taking the time to look at someone carefully when you first meet her, and to thoughtfully form a full impression of that person. The second step is to make mental associations. When someone tells you her name, there’s a good chance you’re familiar with something that either shares her name or is very close to it. It could be another person, a place, a favorite product or anything that’s highly relevant to you and your life. Say you meet someone who shares your sister’s name – associate her with your sister. If you’re introduced to someone named “Clare,” associate her with one of your favorite desserts – a chocolate eclair. The third and final step is the power of repetition. Never underestimate the effectiveness of repeating someone’s name multiple times immediately following an introduction. It’s also wise to recall the name from time to time over the next few days. If you do, you’re sure to find yourself with a stronger memory and fewer awkward encounters. Another tip for improving the memory is to sharpen your senses. The logic here is that when your powers of observation are strong, so is your memory. Here’s a simple practice you can do to heighten your powers of observation and memory: Start by entering a room in your house and carefully observing everything you see. Then, exit the room and begin writing down everything you can remember. Repeating this exercise daily, using different rooms, will soon find both your memory and observational skills getting sharper. Now you know the golden rules of success, it’s time to start putting them to work for you and your goals. The key message in these blinks: Success isn’t out of your reach once you put your mind to it. By developing the right thoughts and strengthening your self-confidence, you’ll soon find yourself getting closer to your goals with greater ease. There are a variety of techniques that can help you make important social contacts, seal big business deals and develop useful habits that make life easier – all with a minimal amount of effort needed. Never underestimate the power of positive thinking to effect real changes in your life. Actionable advice: Dress for success.  Being well-dressed has many advantages in the professional world. First of all, it’ll make you feel more comfortable and confident – two crucial elements to success. Secondly, smart clothes will give your colleagues a more favorable first impression of you, which in turn will make you more trustworthy in their eyes. Got feedback?

How are you supposed to juggle a full-time job while ensuring you consume healthy, nutritious meals and go to the gym? When do you have the time in between all that to rest, let alone enjoy sex? Lack of energy and time are the two main obstacles to optimizing our day, but thankfully there are ways to combat them. Marcus has laid out some life hacks that are easy to do and take virtually no time to implement, allowing you to become the best version of yourself. He highlights simple, routine things detrimental to your health and daily performance you may not even be aware of and provides solutions with which to replace these bad habits. In these blinks, you’ll find out what sways a judge to grant parole; which historical figures enjoyed a good nap; and how you can have more sex. What’s the first thing you do after getting out of bed in the morning? Most of us hop in the shower or reach for a cup of coffee to kick-start our brains. If you want the best start to your day, however, you need to get properly hydrated, as your body becomes dehydrated during sleep. If you manage to get a good night’s rest, that is a minimum of seven hours without drinking any water. And if you live in a dry climate, were at the gym the previous day, or had a few alcoholic beverages the night before, then you would’ve been dehydrated even before going to bed! During the night, you typically lose around a pound of water through sweat. Even mild dehydration can result in headaches, anxiety and irritability, which isn’t a great way to begin your day. So how do we effectively rehydrate after waking up? The answer is not to drink coffee, but water. When you drink coffee on an empty stomach, your bloodstream gets hit incredibly fast by caffeine. As a result, your body releases stress hormones that propel you into your fight or flight mode. To put it another way, waking up with caffeine tricks your body into feeling as though it’s being chased by a lion! What you should do instead is drink a glass of water with some fresh lemon and a pinch of salt. This will not only rehydrate you but provide essential nutrients and minerals such as potassium, calcium and zinc, making it the perfect way to start your day. When you walk down the breakfast aisle of your local supermarket, what do you see? You’re likely to come across things like croissants, waffles and toaster pastries. But none of these are suitable breakfast foods – they’re sugar bombs. A typical American breakfast consists of cereal, white bread and packaged juices, which don’t help our bodies. These items are simple carbohydrates, meaning they often contain plenty of refined sugar and very little fiber. Simple carbohydrates rapidly raise the sugar level in your bloodstream, and high levels of sugar are poisonous to your cells, which is why your digestive system releases the hormone insulin to keep your blood sugar levels in check. Unfortunately, when insulin gets into our bloodstream, it makes us lethargic and irritable, and over the long term, can cause serious health problems, like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The effects of a simple-carbohydrate breakfast can also have worrying impacts on the whole of society. A 2011 study in Israel found that prisoners were much more likely to be granted parole immediately after judges had had breakfast or lunch, when the sugar level in their blood was rising. In comparison, when their blood sugar levels dropped, around two hours after eating, the judges almost never granted parole. Simply put, the judges showed less compassion when their blood sugar levels were low, highlighting the importance of a balanced meal when it comes to decision-making on a societal level. Imagine your life ten-thousand years ago, huddled around a fire or basking in the summer sun. Your dinner would consist of freshly hunted game, foraged plant roots and leafy vegetation. Though this might not sound like the most appetizing meal, it may surprise you to know that it’s healthier than our diets today. Our modern lifestyle is robbing us of many minerals, nutrients and good bacteria that were routinely part of our ancestors’ diets. Prehistoric humans used to eat animals that lived off of nutritious, wild vegetation. When our ancestors fed on those animals, they received the same vegetable nutrients. The products you consume today, such as beef, dairy and eggs, come from animals raised on corn, which is very low in nutrients. An undernourished diet for the animals means an undernourished diet for you. Furthermore, our ancestors consumed plants that grew in mineral-rich, naturally fertilized soil. Today’s arable land has been over-farmed and stripped of nutrients, leaving the crops – and you – devoid of essential minerals. But despite these changes, you can maintain a healthy diet by taking supplements. You might want to start by taking a vitamin D supplement. Your body can produce Vitamin D, but for that to happen, you need to spend time in the sun. Given our hectic modern lifestyles, which demand most of us to work inside an office and wear suits and long-sleeved shirts, this can be difficult to manage. It would be easier to have the ample amount of time our ancestors had to lie around all day in the sun, but for us modern-day busy bees, supplements can help. Are you familiar with the post-lunch slump? That time of the day when you get back to your desk after lunch but are sapped of energy and the ability to concentrate. Most of us fight this slump by hitting the coffee machine or grabbing an energy drink. But there’s another, healthier way to help keep you alert and finish out your day. When you start feeling sluggish after lunch, it’s your body signaling for you to rest, and taking a short nap has scientifically proven benefits. Studies have found that naps improve cognitive and motor performance far better than large intakes of caffeine. Reaction times, logical reasoning and immune system function all increase after a nap. A British experiment carried out in 2008 compared a nap, a cup of coffee and more sleep during the night to see which of the three would best improve participants’ after-lunch energy and alertness levels. The winner? A nap! Beyond science, historical figures and modern companies have also noted the power of napping. Prolific figures such as Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, Albert Einstein and Napoleon used to nap regularly. Some even set aside time for napping in their schedules! The importance of a nap has continued into the modern day, with tech companies like Google and Uber encouraging employees to take a sleep break during work hours. What if a miracle drug existed that could reduce your weight, relieve stress, strengthen muscles, increase your longevity, help you sleep well and fight depression? Well stop imagining, because it already exists – it’s called exercise. Even though exercise is an effective measure against things that ail us, 80 percent of Americans are not getting their recommended weekly dose of physical training. The reason why we aren’t exercising is that we set unhealthy goals which result in frustration and injury. Some men start at the gym with the short-sighted goal of strengthening their pectoral muscles. This means that they overdevelop their chest while neglecting their back muscles. Such a narrow focus will result in oversized pecs that exert a lot of pressure on the shoulders, straining their rotator cuffs and front deltoids. By the time they reach middle age, their shoulders are likely to be so damaged that even a push-up isn’t possible. This leads to frustration, quitting the gym and neglecting their health. Thankfully, there’s a way to ensure that exercise becomes a long-term, sustainable habit: simply approach it as a way to boost your overall health, not just a way to change your appearance. If you need some motivation, remember that we’re attracted to healthy people. That’s right – healthy is sexy. If you want to find that special someone, aim to improve your health with exercise, and you’ll also end up improving your attractiveness! Sex is everywhere, used to sell everything from cars to laundry detergent. But why is it so ubiquitous in advertising? Because an overwhelmingly large portion of the world’s population craves it. And why shouldn’t they? Sex is beneficial, and we should all be doing it more often. Besides the obvious pleasure benefits, regular sex is good for your well-being. A recent study showed that regular sex can help to fight depression, combat the aging process, increase prostate health, enhance wound healing and raise pain tolerance. It also found that men who had sex less than once a week were twice as likely to experience erectile dysfunction. So, regular sex is a good thing. But how can you have more of it? For those in committed relationships, the key is igniting the sex drive. One way to do so is by boosting your testosterone levels. Testosterone is the hormone that makes you crave sex and is found in both female and male bodies. As you get older, however, your testosterone levels get lower. To ramp up your testosterone levels, and therefore your sex drive, try adding more fat to your diet. Your body needs adequate amounts of saturated fats and cholesterol to produce testosterone. One study found that participants’ testosterone levels dropped significantly when on a low-fat diet. After switching to high-fat diets, their testosterone levels increased. Having sex is a fun, free and healthy activity, so stock up on some healthy fats like avocados, nuts and wild salmon and enjoy yourselves! The key message in these blinks: To feel good, be successful and improve your life, rehydrate by drinking water every morning, take supplements and avoid simple carbohydrates. Remember to take naps to boost productivity, target your overall health by exercising and boost your testosterone levels so that you can enjoy more sex. Actionable advice: Take 20-minute power naps. The most effective nap takes 20 minutes. So find a quiet, peaceful place to get comfortable and set your alarm before turning on airplane mode. If you’re at home, take a nap on your bed or sofa. If you’re lucky enough to have a quiet area at work where you can take a nap, set aside 20 minutes so that you can return to your desk reinvigorated and brimming with energy. Got feedback?

Taylor","summary":"As the legendary Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu told his readers over 2,500 years ago, the key to victory is engaging your opponent on your own terms. If you can’t prevent conflict, choose the battlefield. Skirmishes in the marketplace aren’t won with cannons and swords, but they’re battles all the same. If you want to come out on top, you’ll need to define the terms of engagement. That’s something the world’s most successful companies do every day. Whether you’re a dog food manufacturer, a Swiss watchmaker or a Las Vegas hotel, the only way to stay one step ahead of the competition is by thinking outside the box. But you don’t have to reinvent the wheel to do that – you can learn from the best. Packed with actionable insights from figures as diverse as Henry Ford and the leaders of Netflix, these blinks are guaranteed to help you up your leadership skills and take your business to the next level.   In these blinks, you’ll learn how traditional industries use their illustrious histories to fend off newcomers; what Henry Ford learned when he visited a modern slaughterhouse; and why the best leaders combine humility and ambition. The world moves fast these days. Even well-established companies can wake up to find that they’ve been outrun by their competitors. Therefore, your best bet is often to get out of the rat race and focus your energies elsewhere. The most effective thing you can do is try to set yourself apart from the crowd. Take the advertising agency TBWA: in 2004, the dog food company Pedigree commissioned them to develop a new marketing strategy. Pedigree was in a sticky situation – it was being squeezed by high-end, health-focused brands on one side and low-price competition on the other. TBWA decided to redefine the rules of the game. Its advice to Pedigree? Stop marketing yourself as a dog food company and position yourself as a brand that simply cares about dogs. Employees were encouraged to bring their four-legged friends to work and even given health insurance plans for their pooches. Meanwhile, Pedigree started running ads for dog adoption. The product itself didn’t change at all, but the company’s image was transformed into a brand that stood for something more than just dog food. The fresh way of looking at things also gave Pedigree a new sense of purpose. Those in the know call this the rule of vuja dé – the opposite of déjà vu. It’s the sense of having already experienced something and finding a new way of looking at something familiar. Established companies have another resource up their sleeve when the going gets tough: their past successes. Nicolas Hayek, the CEO of the Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking in the 1970s, showed how effective that could be. The Swiss watch industry was in crisis when he took up his position. Cheap East Asian watches had flooded the market. But instead of joining the race to the bottom, Hayek used the industry’s illustrious past to renew its identity. Storied watch brands owned by the company, like Omega, were rebranded as “watches for people who achieve” – a canny way of targeting high-earners willing to pay top dollar for a product rooted in tradition. The corporation’s cheaper watches were also given a makeover. In 1983, it launched Swatch – a brand specializing in less expensive timepieces made in Switzerland, rather than in countries with cheaper labor. Harnessing Switzerland’s association with its long history of watchmaking was a smart strategy – by 2008, Hayek’s corporation was the undisputed leader in its field. In 1912, Henry Ford visited a slaughterhouse in Chicago. What he saw there changed the face of carmaking forever. The slaughterhouse had a unique division of labor: carcasses were attached to a monorail and moved along a line of workers, each of whom had their own particular task to complete. That was the system Ford later employed in his factory. The iconic Ford Model T rolled off an assembly line inspired by what he’d seen at the slaughterhouse. It’s an excellent example of how groundbreaking innovations are often born from borrowing ideas well-established in other industries. Take Commerce Bank: in 1997 it was valued at $400 million. Ten years later it was bought out for a whopping $8.5 billion. So what changed in the intervening decade? The bank decided to look for new ideas outside its own sector. The supermarket chain Walmart was one source of inspiration. Their shops were open for between 70 and 80 hours a week, including Saturdays and Sundays. If Walmart can do it, Commerce Bank’s strategists asked, then why can’t we? Their decision to mimic the retail outlet revolutionized banking – an industry in which such hours were unheard of. But no matter how successful this approach can be, it’s still often controversial. Prepare yourself for resistance if you’re thinking of going down the same road! Just ask Gary Kaplan, CEO of Virginia Mason Medical Hospital in the early 2000s. The hospital was facing serious efficiency issues when Kaplan arrived. His solution was to send a group of employees to visit a Toyota factory in Japan and introduce them to new management techniques. “Just-in-time” manufacturing – what the Japanese call kanban – was starting to make waves. It’s a way of reducing the amount of time materials spend in inventory by optimizing scheduling. Sounds like a pretty useful idea for a hospital struggling with inefficiency, right? But that’s not what the doctors at Kaplan’s hospital thought. They objected to the notion that medical practitioners had anything to learn from a car manufacturer and put up stiff resistance. Many of them even boycotted the trip! Those who did go, however, soon saw why they’d been sent to Japan. The ideas they brought back helped them cut waiting times for lab results by a stunning 90 percent. That amounted to a three-fold increase in the time nurses could spend with their patients. When the author attended a conference for business leaders in regional banking, he was stunned by the results of a small survey of participants. The attendees had been asked a simple question: “Why should customers choose your bank over the competition?” Two-thirds of them couldn’t answer it! That’s a sign that something’s amiss. Your aim as a manager should be to run your company in such a way that everyone knows the answer to that question. Take the online retailer Zappos: it gave Amazon a run for its money until being acquired by them for a cool $1.2 billion in 2009. But how on earth did it manage to compete with them at all? It set itself apart from the crowd by excelling in one area – offering the best customer experience. Repeat customers, for example, invariably received free next-day delivery. The company’s call centers were well-staffed, and employees were free to spend as long as necessary talking to customers. If a customer enquired about a product that wasn’t in stock, Zappos’ agents searched out the best deal offered by their competitors. It didn’t make the company any money, of course, but the quality of customer care left a lasting impression on callers. Going the extra mile is an integral part of success in business. Companies like Zappos show that you can’t do big things when you limit yourself to current standards of excellence. Another company that’s put that insight to use is MGM Grand Las Vegas. When Gamal Aziz took charge of the hotel in 2001, it had profits of around $170 million. A few years later and they’d more than doubled to $400 million. What changed? Aziz looked at things differently. He wasn’t interested in increasing efficiency by a certain percentage, but in figuring out how much revenue the hotel space was capable of generating. Once he had a number, he worked backward from there. The MGM Grand’s restaurant was making a profit of $2 million a year. Aziz’s calculations showed that it could be making $5 million – meaning it was losing $3 million a year in potential profits. It was soon closed down, and a rebranded restaurant opened up in its place. It went on to make $6.5 million – surpassing even Aziz’s predictions! Businesses don’t need to be heartless Scrooge-like enterprises, squeezing every last penny out of their customers. In fact, there are plenty of companies whose human touch has given them a leg up in the modern world of commerce. That’s because successful businesses aren’t just money-making machines – they’re communities. Take DaVita Inc: the company operates just under fifteen-hundred kidney dialysis centers around the US. In 1999, it embraced a new image, summed up by the phrase “community before company.” So what does that look like in practice? DaVita employees are encouraged to create a welcoming and friendly environment for patients – the aim being to make them feel like they’re at home. When the author visited one of the company’s centers, he found the place humming with positive energy. The hallway featured a massive “wall of fame” covered in photos of employees and patients, as well as personal stories and messages. DaVita also runs training programs which assign executives to particular centers. There they learn from caregivers why the business matters and even perform caregiving work themselves. The idea is to make sure managers don’t lose touch with the nitty-gritty of day-to-day life in the company’s centers. It’s a winning approach. Between 1999 and 2009, DaVita turned its business around. From $50 million in annual losses, it started generating $400 million in profits! That makes sense when you know how important emotional engagement is to your customers. Show that you care and you’ll create a loyal customer base. Recent research by Gallup into customer satisfaction found that, according to the consulting group’s data, there’s little difference in customer behavior between those described as “rationally satisfied” and “rationally dissatisfied” when it comes to a company’s pricing and product quality. The real difference is between the rationally satisfied and the “emotionally engaged” – customers who identify themselves with the company and view its services as “irreplaceable.” London Drugs offers an instructive example of this human touch in action. The firm started out as a small Canadian pharmacy in 1945. Since then it’s branched out into a number of different markets, including real estate. Wherever it goes, success follows. An important part of the company’s initial success was its insistence on truly serving its existing customers. Instead of just asking how to get more customers, the company asked what more it could do for the ones they already had. This way, they became an important part of people’s lives. As a result of this, customers simply trust it with any product, whether it’s drugstore items or condos. CEOs are often depicted as lonely geniuses with near superhuman powers. That might make for entertaining movies and TV, but in the real world, this can be downright dangerous – both to managers and their companies. True leaders avoid drinking the kool-aid and take a different approach entirely – they strive to be humbitious. The concept of “humbition” – a blend of humility and ambition – was coined by Jane Harper. It’s a leadership style she advocated during her long stint at the American technology giant IBM. What does it look like in practice? The idea is simple: leaders should be ambitious while recognizing the fact that other people in the company might know something they don’t. Because success is a fruit of collaboration, leaders should give credit where credit is due. After all, no leader – however brilliant – can compete with the combined brainpower of the company’s employees. Dave Marsing is another leader who believes in the humbitious approach. A high-flyer at the tech company Intel Corp, he suffered a heart attack at the age of 36. Since then, he’s been a fierce advocate of rethinking traditional ideas of leadership. Embracing humility, he argues, is key when it comes to achieving results without working so hard that your heart might not be able to keep up. But it’s not just leaders who benefit from taking their foot off the gas pedal – the whole company does. That’s because the best ideas often come from the bottom of an organization. CEOs who understand that have the best chance of succeeding. One example comes from the software company Rite-Solutions: It introduced something called “Mutual Fun” – an internal “stock market” of ideas proposed by employees. Everyone at the company is free to make proposals and vote on those of others by buying “stocks” in the ones they like. The schemes and plans which do best in this marketplace of ideas are adopted by the company, which rolls them out as products, services and innovations. Between 2005 and 2009, this radical initiative generated more than 50 workable ideas, with a total of 15 being put into place. Together, those ideas accounted for around 20 percent of Rite-Solutions’ total revenue! Imagine you had the combined brainpower of the whole world at your disposal. You’d be mad not to make use of it, right? Well, in a way you already do! The information age has created innumerable opportunities for companies to draw on the global hive mind to give themselves a boost. That’s pretty handy since the best solution to a problem usually presents itself after you’ve sought all the help that’s available. Take American media service provider Netflix: in 2006, the company announced a competition to improve Cinematch, its in-house film and TV show recommendation software. The goal was to make it at least ten percent more likely that customers would give movies suggested by Cinematch a high rating. It was an ambitious target – so much so that Netflix’s own employees had little chance of hitting it on their own. So they outsourced the challenge, announcing that the best solution would receive a million-dollar cash prize. The competition created a truly global community. People pooled their resources and shared their ideas and coding skills on online forums, unleashing a wave of international brainpower. The winner? A seven-person team that collaborated online without ever meeting one another in person! Asking strangers for help is one thing, but there’s a more specific group of people who are also likely to have illuminating ideas – your customers. That’s something the t-shirt company Threadless puts into practice every day – all its products are designed by its customers. Here’s how it works: People share their designs on the company’s website and vote on the designs of other users. If their design wins enough people over to be rolled out, they receive a $2000 prize and a $500 voucher to use in the online shop. It’s a winning formula. Threadless only needs a team of 35 employees and sells around a million t-shirts every year. But it’s more than just a business – it’s also a community of customer-designers, some of whom have used the site as a springboard to launch their own careers. The key message in these blinks: If you want to give your business a boost, it’s a good idea to take a look at what today’s most successful companies are doing. Whether it’s IBM or Pedigree, you’ll usually find that their strategies have a couple of things in common – including setting themselves apart from the crowd, being open to new ideas from other industries and building a community as well as a business. Put those into practice, and you’re bound to see your business thrive.  Actionable advice: Ask yourself what makes your business special. If you want your company to stand out from the crowd, you need to know what makes it unique. Asking yourself a few simple questions will help to figure that out. What are you trying to achieve? What do you do that your competitors don’t? The answers will not only give you a clearer sense of purpose, but they’ll also show you what changes you might need to make. Got feedback?

First, there are the roles we play without even noticing it – child, spouse, parent, friend. As if these roles weren’t tiring and daunting enough, there are countless others that we adopt as life goes on, such as leader or teacher, athlete or entrepreneur. So, how can you stay motivated when performing these myriad roles? Well, that’s exactly what these blinks seek to help you with. Drawing on a range of sources, from athletic research to academic studies, they’ll provide you with practical tips and professional pointers for staying calm and performing at the very top of your abilities. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: that pre-performance anxiety can be dispelled with a spank; why contagion is sometimes positive; and which song is the best motivation booster. The big day has arrived. In a few hours, you’ll be auditioning for Broadway’s next hit musical, singing and dancing for a group of people you’ve never seen before. You’re so nervous you could explode. OK, maybe musical theater isn’t your thing – but you’ve probably experienced pre-performance anxiety at some point, whether before a job interview or while preparing a presentation. Anticipatory anxiousness – more commonly known as the fight-or-flight response – is a physiological reaction to stress. When you feel threatened, your body produces adrenaline, a hormone that causes an increase in your blood pressure, as well as your heart and respiratory rates. Now, this is helpful if you have to run away or engage in a physical confrontation. It’s not so great, however, when there’s no tangible threat of danger. Inconveniently, almost any stress can trigger the fight-or-flight response. For instance, the American musician Carly Simon once suffered such an acute attack of anxiety during a 1981 concert that she had to seek help from the audience. Fans had to get onstage and calm her down by rubbing her arms. But maybe you’re looking for a less hands-on relaxant. Well, one way to alleviate anxiety is to reappraise it. Alison Brooks first perceived the benefits of reappraisal while auditioning for Princeton’s undergrad a cappella group. She noticed that excited singers tended to perform better than nervous ones. Later, while pursuing her doctorate, she conducted a study. Before giving a performance, participants were told to do one of three things: say “I’m so excited,” say “I’m so nervous” or say nothing and try to remain calm. The results proved Brooks’ hypothesis. The participants who announced their excitement, and thus reappraised it, performed better than the others. They managed to alchemize anxiety into excitement. This is effective because returning from an anxious state to a calm state is hard. The two emotions are far apart. Transitioning from anxious to excited, however, doesn’t take much effort. Centering is yet another anxiety-reducing technique. Aikido masters in Japan remain calm yet intent when practicing their martial art. Robert Nideffer, a sports psychologist, devised steps to achieving similar focus. Begin by breathing deeply. While concentrating on your breath, release the tension in your muscles. Then imagine that all your body’s energy is concentrated in your physical center, the point just beneath your belly button. Once it’s all there, release it. This centering technique will bring you calm and renewed focus. There are countless ways to prepare yourself for an upcoming performance. Some people opt for meditation. Others, like the singer Carly Simon, sometimes asked to be spanked, because the physical pain helped her conquer her stage fright. Regardless of how you choose to dispel those pre-performance jitters, however, there’s something you should always be: consistent. Athletes are aware of this – and it pays off. Just consider the findings of a 2010 study conducted by sports psychologist Stewart Cotterill. He took studies of athletes’ pre-performance routines and, in an attempt to gauge the effectiveness of these routines, did a meta-analysis. His findings were illuminating. They showed that when athletes engage in an uncontested activity, such as a putt in golf or a free throw in basketball, a little ritual – think swinging the club twice or bouncing the ball a few times – improved their performance. Furthermore, athletes without rituals can learn one and expect the same results: better performance. Group rituals are even more effective, according to a study by Michael Norton, professor at Harvard Business School. In the study, he split 221 participants into multiple teams, who then competed in a scavenger hunt. Prior to the hunt, some teams learned and performed a ritual; standing in a circle, they stomped and clapped, then put their hands in the middle and yelled: “Let’s Go!” Meanwhile, members of the other teams silently read an article. In the end, the teams who performed the rituals did far better in the hunt. They found locations faster and missed task deadlines half as often as the other teams. And, post-hunt, the members of these teams were more likely to say they liked each other. Belief also has an effect on performance. Just consider the surprising findings of Lancaster University’s Sally Linkenauger. In one study, she found that if golfers believed their clubs had once belonged to renowned Professional Golfers’ Association players, they performed much better. Compared to a control group, they estimated holes to be 9 percent larger and were 32 percent more likely to sink their putts. Linkenauger thinks this is due to “positive contagion,” a term she coined to describe the idea that objects can be imbued with the powers of the people who touch them. It’s also partially why people cherish autographs; the mere signature of a famous person infuses the signed paper with a special intimacy. You’ve probably heard of Thinking, Fast and Slow, the best-selling book by Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman. In the book, Kahneman argues that the human brain has two cognitive systems – one “fast,” the other “slow.” System 1, the fast one, is almost reflexive. It operates with little conscious effort. System 2, in contrast, operates slowly and requires concentration. System 1 is a sort of autopilot. Meanwhile, system 2 has you fully in the driver’s seat. This impacts performance because system 1 can help you stay cool under pressure. Richard Jenkins, who serves as CEO of a start-up, always switches to system 1 cognition when he gives presentations. He does this by opening with the same introduction, which he knows so well that he barely has to think. This intro helps him establish an instant connection with the audience, and, after delivering it, he can seamlessly transition to the topic he’s presenting on, knowing that the audience is engaged and sympathetic. So knowing when, and how, to switch between system 1 and system 2 may affect your performance. But it’s not the only performance-influencing phenomenon out there. Another is priming – that is, planting a subconscious bias in someone without their knowledge. The most famous research in this field is by John Bargh, a psychology professor at Yale. In one of his experiments, he had participants solve word puzzles. Some of these puzzles contained “rude” words, such as “obnoxious” and “impolite.” Others contained “polite” words, like “patiently,” “cordially” and “appreciative.” Afterward, each participant was asked to wait. They would receive further instructions soon. Meanwhile, the person who was to give them these instructions conducted a conversation with a third party, in full view of the participant. The result? Well, the people whose puzzles had featured “rude” words were quicker to interrupt the conversation than those who’d been exposed to “polite” words. In short, each participant had been primed to act in a particular way. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem likely that you can prime yourself. After all, priming takes place subconsciously, and it’s pretty tough, if not entirely impossible, to consciously alter your subconscious processes. So the question remains – what else can you do to perform better? In the classic 1986 sports film Hoosiers, Gene Hackman’s character, coach Norman Dale, delivers a particularly effective pep talk to his basketball team as they play in the semifinals. Coach Dale tells his team of young players to remember the fundamental things that got them here. They should ignore the size of the crowd and the opposing team’s fancy uniforms; they should even ignore the score. All that matters, Dale says, is that they execute, to the best of their ability, the things they’ve been practicing. If they do that, and really try their best, then they’re all winners. You’ll notice that this speech doesn’t focus on outputs, such as winning the game. Rather, it focuses on inputs, or the amount of effort each player contributes. This, according to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, is the sort of pep talk that will put people in a “growth mindset” – a state of mind that enables them to perform well and, over time, even improve. So, when giving a pep talk, do your best to emphasize input, not output. Another tip for good pep talks is knowing when to appeal to the emotions of your audience and when to rely more on facts. Tiffanye Vargas used to play soccer in Texas. During this time, she became interested in pep talks, so it seemed only natural to tackle the topic when she entered graduate school. In research conducted for her PhD, Vargas discovered that there is a time and place for information-heavy pep talks. When a team has never played against a particular opponent, or when it’s suffered a narrow loss to that opponent, concrete information is especially useful. However, if the team is an underdog or about to compete in a championship match, it’s better to stir up the players’ emotions with some fiery language. If you had to name the quintessential motivational song, the one most associated with getting psyched up and ready to rumble, which would you choose? Did “Eye of the Tiger” come to mind? Well, there’s a reason Survivor’s rock single was used as the theme song for Rocky III: It truly does improve people’s performance. Just consider these results from a 1995 study. Researchers took runners who’d clocked identical times on the 60-meter dash and paired them up against one another. However, before racing, one runner from each pair listened to “Eye of the Tiger” while the other stood silently by. One minute of music had significant effects. It hastened the listening runners’ heartbeats, as well as tensed their muscles and lowered their anxiety – physiological effects that gave them a definite advantage and allowed them to beat their opponents. Today, this song is used as an inspirational anthem by countless individuals, from care providers assisting stroke patients to CEOs setting the mood for board meetings. But why are some songs – such as “Eye of the Tiger” – such effective motivators? Well, Costas Karageorghis has one answer. A consultant for massive sporting brands like Nike and the agency IMG, Karageorghis is the world’s preeminent expert on the effects of music on athletic performance. He says that rhythm and musicality (the use of melody and harmony) are the ingredients that make a song motivating. The effects of motivational music are less vague. When listening to inspirational music, an athlete will begin to move in sync with the beat. This synchronicity both energizes and calms the athlete. The music may also reduce the athlete’s perception of exertion, making the workout feel easier than it truly is. What’s the best way to harness the motivational might of music? When working out, try splitting up your regimen into separate periods – one for stretching, one for warming up, and then one for strength training, endurance and cooling down. Karageorghis recommends tailoring your playlist to each period, so that while you're running, for example, there’s a rhythmic beat, and a more relaxing tempo for when you’re cooling down. Do you remember the first time you felt it? Perhaps it was during a game of Monopoly. Or maybe during your first game of tag. Whenever it was, you’ve probably experienced it: the thrill of competition. Even if it was more of a low-level wish to win, you’ve doubtless felt the invigorating determination that competition gives rise to. But is this a good thing? Well, in performative terms, yes it is. Head-to-head competition improves performance. Way back in the 1890s, an Indiana University graduate student named Norman Triplett carried out a few experiments that are as relevant today as they were then. He looked at a series of bicycle races from 1897, in which some 2,000 cyclists had competed, and analyzed the results. There were three types of races: His analysis showed that paced cyclists rode on average 34.4 seconds per mile faster than unpaced cyclists. Also, those competing directly against other cyclists averaged 5 seconds faster yet. Competing against a rival – that is, against someone you know, as opposed to a complete stranger – can be even more motivating. While still a child, Gavin Kilduff, an associate professor of management at New York University, noted that competing against strangers didn’t motivate him as much as competing against a known rival. His research shows that, when playing against rivals, NCAA basketball teams played better defense and blocked more shots. Similarly, long-distance runners tended to run faster when pitted against rivals. But rivalry extends beyond sports. It can provide extra motivation in the business world, too. In 2012, a man named John Legere took over as CEO of T-Mobile. At the time, the company wasn’t doing very well. Of the four big US wireless carriers, it was the tiniest, and a merger with AT&T had recently been blocked by the Federal Trade Commission. Team spirit was not high. But Legere took this slump as an opportunity to engage in some unorthodox tactics. He started publicly bad-mouthing AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile’s main competitors, tweeting about their poor service and generally talking trash about them in order to induce rivalry. And it worked. Since then, T-Mobile’s stock price has more than doubled, as has its number of subscribers. The lesson is that people always tend to root for the underdog. You probably associate performance-enhancing drugs with athletes who’d do anything to get an edge on the competition, even if it means putting their career on the line. However, today there are many ordinary people who take such drugs to deal with more mundane situations. Just consider propranolol, a beta blocker initially intended to treat heart disease. Developed in 1962 by a Scottish pharmacologist named James Black, the drug inhibited the body’s reaction to adrenaline. This, in turn, lowered blood pressure and reduced that likelihood of heart attack. Fast-forward to the 1970s, and it was also being prescribed as cure for performance anxiety. Today, it’s in wide use, and some people, such as Scott Stossel, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, swear by it. Before beginning to use propranolol, Stossel’s anxiety was threatening to derail his career. He could hardly give speeches or get through televised interviews without having a total meltdown. There are side effects, including blurred vision and feelings of constriction in the chest – but, for Stossel, it’s worth it. He’s now able to do things he could barely tolerate before. Performance-enhancing drugs are now also commonly used to improve focus. The two most famous examples are Adderall and Ritalin. But there are others. Modafinil, for instance, is especially popular among Silicon Valley and Wall Street highfliers. Developed in France in 1970, Modafinil was intended to treat narcolepsy, among other sleep disorders. How it works is still a bit unclear, but users feel an enhanced sensation of alertness and wakefulness. This, in turn, helps them enter a state of concentrated flow. Most people are familiar with the potential side effects of Adderall and Ritalin. Addiction, for example, is common and can cause psychosis. Unlike these drugs, Modafinil is less addictive, according to some studies. Nonetheless, the FDA considers its risk of addiction significant enough to classify it as a “schedule IV controlled substance.” Despite these risks, many people do take performance-enhancing drugs, claiming that they help them get more out of life. The key message in these blinks: Whether you’re running a 100-meter sprint or a board meeting, you want to ensure you put in your best performance. Luckily, there are ways to give yourself a competitive edge. By selecting the right music, engaging in rivalries and adopting rituals, you can fend off anxiety and psych yourself up for any occasion.  Actionable advice: Make use of performance contagion. Performance contagion occurs when someone is using an object that he or she believes previously belonged to someone with exceptional skill. When starting a new, daunting project, consider acquiring such an object from someone who has already succeeded in what you aim to do. Using it may well give you an extra performance boost. The author, for example, is a fan of author Malcolm Gladwell and managed to procure a keyboard Gladwell had written on. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Are you perpetually tardy, type-A personality, or maybe a poor writer? Where did those beliefs come from? A judgmental teacher, a circle of friends who label you a certain way, or maybe from yourself? We all have an image of the type of person we are. Some of these are positive, and some are detrimental to moving forward and making changes. We use stories to understand the world, but sometimes we make ourselves the villain without thinking twice about the consequences of that narrative. So get out your editing pen; it’s time to make some changes. In these blinks, you’ll learn how we’re all affected by hypnosis; how you can practice the piano in your head; and why you might not be a poor math student after all. Each person has a self-image – a mental blueprint that describes the kind of person she is. This all-important conception of self contains the beliefs she holds about herself based on past experiences, successes and failures. Such perceptions are crucial since people act like the person they believe themselves to be. If you think of yourself as a failure, you’ll quite likely fail. Conversely, if you consider yourself successful, you’ll find ways to succeed. But why are these life-determining self-images formed in the first place? Well, it’s usually for a logical reason. A person might consider herself a failure because she had a bad year in school after her parents got divorced. While some people can easily recover from such an event and be back on the honor roll in no time, others find themselves trapped in a self-image that tells them they’re the kind of student who gets Fs. In this way, whether good or bad, the formation of a self-image is crucial to everything that follows in a person’s life. Here’s another example: the author knew a man who suffered from his ‘ugly’ looks; he felt his nose was too large and that his ears stuck out. He suffered because he felt other people were judging him for his peculiar looks. In reality, however, people weren’t judging him for his appearance. Rather, it was his own negative self-image that made him cripplingly insecure and miserable. In this case, his perception that others were spiteful toward him made him spiteful back. However, this was a loop that could be broken if he turned his negative self-image around. We’ll learn more about these loops in the next blink. You probably think of hypnosis as a stunt for an oddball circus act. But every human is hypnotized in one way or another. After all, the power of hypnosis comes from belief, and you already know how powerful beliefs can be. Just consider a friend of the author, Dr. Alfred Adler, who did poorly at math in school, leading his teacher to believe he had no talent for the subject. Adler accepted this as a fact, and the grades he earned proved his teacher right. But one day, he suddenly understood how to solve a complex equation. When he showed the solution to his teacher, he realized that he had no trouble grasping arithmetic. His confidence soon increased, and he became a better math student. What changed? Adler had been hypnotized by a false belief about himself. Studies have proven that Adler’s experience is typical of many low-achieving students. People experience both positive and negative beliefs that hypnotize them in similar ways, and the goal is therefore to overcome the preconceptions that hold us back. To do so, you need only harness the power of rational thinking. Your negative beliefs aren’t a result of facts or experiences, rather the conclusions you draw from them. Therefore, rational thinking – which is logical and conscious – can be used to control your unconscious mind. To start uprooting the beliefs that create your sense of inferiority, ask, “why?” Doing so will help you overcome irrational and false assessments like, “I failed yesterday; therefore I’ll fail today.” Instead, when faced with such a thought, you’ll be able to see that each day presents an opportunity to learn from the past. People have often theorized about the body as a machine – a concept that isn’t too far from the truth. While humans aren’t machines per se, we each have a machine that we can use when necessary. The author calls this phenomenon psycho-cybernetics, a conception of the human brain and nervous system as a servo-mechanism or automatic response that processes negative feedback to guide its course. This theory operates according to the principles of cybernetics, the study of machines and mechanics. By applying psycho-cybernetics, we can uncover new insights into why and how humans behave the way they do. One such insight is that humans have a built-in mechanism for success. Consider how a baby might try to grab a rattle. He can’t call on any stored information based on prior experiences. Therefore, his hand has to swipe back and forth until he can reach the object. Once he succeeds in grabbing the toy or, in other words, achieves a successful response, he’ll store the memory for future reference. Over time, he can refine his skill at grasping, slowly remembering his successes and forgetting his failures. Similarly, this kind of success mechanism is at play as we work toward our goals. Naturally, activating this mechanism is beneficial and, to begin doing so, we need to use our imagination. The human nervous system can’t tell the difference between experiences that we imagine and ones that actually occur. As a result, it reacts according to what we believe or imagine to be true. Research by Dr. Theodore Xenophon Barber at American University in Washington during the 1950s found that hypnotized subjects easily underwent surgery without anesthesia after being told they could not feel pain. Or take Artur Schnabel, a world-famous concert pianist who rarely practiced on an actual piano. Instead, he would simply refine his art in his head. There are also comparable examples of a darts player and a golfer who improved their skills through mental practice. Whether it’s writer’s block or a stalled brainstorming session, it’s common to hit obstacles when pursuing a creative project. Most creative practitioners know that when such a roadblock presents itself, the only thing they can do is relax and wait for inspiration to return. This wisdom makes perfect sense since humans have a highly specific creative mechanism. It only activates when we become interested in solving a particular problem, consciously consider the dilemma and gather every piece of relevant information. Once we’ve struggled with the problem sufficiently, we reach the point at which further thinking only holds us back. Then our built-in creative instinct kicks in. As a result, we have our best ideas when we’re not actively working. Take the famous inventor, Thomas Edison. Whenever he came up against an issue he couldn’t resolve, he would take a short nap. After these brief respites, he often found the solution he sought. So, while creativity is unreliable, we can reboot it by altering our actions and thoughts. And the same goes for happiness. Here’s how: Most people think of happiness in terms of the future. We think we’ll be happy once we’re married, or get a better job. But happiness must be practiced in the present. We first need to recognize that happiness is an entirely internal feeling, a product of our thoughts and the attitudes we hold about them. If we become unhappy when a driver honks at us, it’s because we chose to respond with annoyance and frustration, which saps our happiness. We can develop a habit of happiness by fixating on positive points and letting go of negative ones. Edison provides another good example. He once lost his multi-million-dollar laboratory in a fire and had no insurance for compensation. Nonetheless, he made the decision to avoid unhappiness and instead began rebuilding first thing the next day. Success isn’t something you simply find any more than failure is something you “arrive at.” Rather, failure and success are the result of forces buried deep within your personality. Both are produced by unique sets of elements. First up you’ll learn about SUCCESS, an acronym that explains the core elements of a successful personality. First comes a Sense of direction. After all, every human is a goal-seeker and, just like a mountain climber, you need an objective to pursue. When you reach the proverbial top, you should simply forge ahead to the next peak. The second trait is Understanding. Most failures are a result of misunderstandings, as people often distort sensory perceptions with fear, anxiety or desire. Just imagine you see two colleagues in conversation. Right as you walk by, they look up and stop talking. You might easily conclude that they were gossiping about you, but that’s unlikely. It’s just one example of how feelings can alter your perceptions. The third necessary trait for success is Courage. After all, only by taking courageous actions can you make your dreams a reality. You need the nerve to back up your ideas by taking calculated risks. If you delay taking action until you’re entirely certain, you’ll never accomplish anything. The fourth characteristic is Charity since successful people are attentive to the problems, needs, dignity and respect of every human. Fifth comes Esteem because, if you think “I can’t do it,” you’ll never move ahead. As a result, a low self-opinion is never a virtue, but rather a threat to your success. Sixth is Self-confidence. Such a feeling is built upon experiencing success, which makes it essential to remember your past triumphs and forget your failures, which threaten to wreck your confidence. And finally, Self-acceptance is the last pillar of success. Without coming to terms with yourself, your faults and weaknesses, you’ll never be able to attain what you desire. These seven elements compose a successful personality. Next up you’ll learn the seven traits that cause a person to fail. The factors that lead to failure can be readily summed up by an acronym of the word FAILURE itself. First comes Frustration, which arises when you feel you can’t realize an important goal. This produces a self-fulfilling prophecy as you think of yourself as incapable and are therefore more likely to fail. Next is Aggressiveness. This energy can help you achieve your goals, but in a failure-type personality, all that aggression is directed toward self-destructive tendencies like worry and rudeness, rather than a worthy aim. Third comes Insecurity or feeling like you don’t live up to requirements. Interestingly enough, insecurity is often caused not by a real lack of ability, but by a distorted system of measurement. In other words, if you compare yourself to an imaginary, likely impossible ideal, you’ll never feel self-assurance. Fourth up is Loneliness, the feeling of being alienated from others. Lonely people cut themselves off from the roads that could lead to a healthy social environment, fail to act and struggle to achieve. The fifth trait of failure is Uncertainty or avoiding mistakes by never making decisions at all. It’s a failure to act and achieve goals, precipitated by the false premise that you shouldn’t act if you’re not certain you’ll succeed. Since no certain path can be found, no decision is made, and you’re safe from failure – or success, for that matter. Sixth comes Resentment, an attempt to make personal failure more digestible by blaming it on unfair treatment. And last is Emptiness, a symptom of failure itself. This feeling results from the sense that life is boring and no pursuit is worth attaining. If you notice any or all of the above traits in yourself, it’s time to make a change. Next up you’ll learn precisely how to go about it. When you incur a physical injury, your body forms a scar to protect the damaged area. In this way, scar tissue is nature’s way of preventing further injuries to the same place. Similarly, people tend to form emotional scars to protect hurt feelings. However, such scars don’t just protect you from the person who initially hurt you; they can also separate you from all other people. After all, they construct an emotional wall that keeps out friends and foes alike. That being said, you can overcome this by offering yourself an emotional face lift. This process is like doing surgery on your emotions, but rather than a scalpel, forgiveness is your primary tool. Just like a sharp surgical implement, genuine forgiveness can cut away old hurts, allowing healing to occur. But to truly forgive, you must forget the feeling that you were wronged and even forget the act of forgiveness itself. Then, once you’ve removed your emotional scars, you can let loose your real personality, which comes from within. Many people have inhibited personalities that prevent them from exercising their creative potential and expressing their true selves. For instance, stuttering is often a result of inhibition. This speech impediment is caused by an excessive tendency to self-monitor, which generates too much negative feedback. It’s a good example of how inhibiting a fixation on what others think and want from you can be. To get past this debilitating feeling, it’s necessary to practice disinhibition. Interestingly enough, while people like to say you should think before you speak, the exact opposite is required. By speaking before you think, you can banish self-conscious thoughts like “should I have done that?” This is the first step on your path to truly unlocking your creative personality. Imagine you’re at home, quietly reading a novel. Your phone starts ringing, and you instinctively jump out of your favorite chair, rushing to answer the call. In the blink of an eye, you went from a peaceful state of mind to one of unrest. And who can blame you? The ring tone is a signal that you’ve learned to obey. But the truth is, you don’t have to answer the phone; you could just as easily ignore it. Therein lies the first technique for achieving peace of mind: start avoiding the different bells that ring around you. This term refers to all the disruptive stimuli that populate your environment. Bells are things to which you have been conditioned to respond by sheer force of habit. For instance, parental warnings result in most children fearing strangers. While such a tendency might serve a reasonable function in kids, it gets carried over into adulthood, causing lots of people to feel uncomfortable around others they don’t know. Strangers have become bells to which the learned response is fear and avoidance. However, you can overcome these conditioned responses by practicing relaxation instead. In other words, if you want to, you can learn to let the bell ring. A good way to ease into this practice is to delay your response, say by counting to three before answering the phone. From there you can slowly extend the time until you eventually ignore the bell altogether. Another way to achieve peace of mind is to construct a mental quiet room that offers you a retreat from the world. You can furnish it with whatever you find relaxing – maybe a beautiful landscape, or your favorite piece of art. Then, whenever you have a few moments to spare between appointments or while riding the bus, calm your mind in your quiet room. The key message in this book: Humans may not be machines, but we can think of our mental processes as mechanized. By using cybernetic principles to understand this machine thinking, we can overcome negative ideas about ourselves, enhance our self-image and live a fulfilling, successful life. Actionable advice: Use a mental picture of heaviness to relax. Sit down in a comfortable chair or lie flat on your back. Imagine that your legs are made out of concrete and envision yourself sitting or lying in place with these heavy extremities. As you sink further down into the floor or the mattress from the sheer weight of your legs, you start to release the tension in your body. For a total of 30 minutes a day, repeat this exercise with your arms, hands, neck and any other body part you want to relax. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Are you struggling at work? Fake it till you make it! Do you suffer from depression? Just change your attitude! Is chemotherapy not curing your cancer? Just imagine all of those cancerous cells imploding on themselves! It’s that easy! Considering how “easy” it is to cure our woes with self-help manuals, and considering how many people actually read self-help material, you’d think that by now we’d live in a paradisical utopia. And yet we don’t. Why? That’s because self-help often advocates amazingly simplistic philosophies, which then produce woefully inadequate strategies for our complex lives. It’s no wonder that all too often neither their basic assumptions nor their ultimate solutions stand up to scientific scrutiny. And not only are the pompous promises found in pop-psych books ineffective, they’re sometimes downright harmful. They raise our expectations to the point where we can no longer be content with anything that is less than perfect, which is simply not possible in an intricate world with so many influences and actors. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you might make better decisions when you wake up on the wrong side of the bed; why spotting negative thoughts is a lot like finding a flea; how useless it is to try to keep a train from flying off the rails; and why, no matter what, we can’t all be winners. It seems obvious that self-esteem is critical for our happiness. After all, it’s good to feel good about ourselves, right? But how important is high self-esteem really? Is it an integral part of every successful and healthy person, as self-help books want you to believe? In pop psychology books, poor self-esteem is blamed for a whole slew of problems. For example, authors attribute underachievement at school or work to the student’s or employee’s underdeveloped belief in himself and his abilities. In the same vein, some popular self-help books link marital problems to one or more partners’ lack of self-respect. Many texts suggest that even school bullies resort to tyrannizing other kids and extorting their lunch money merely as a means to improve their own painfully low self-esteem. The assumption is that, by dominating their peers, bullies can enhance their own lack of self-worth. Yet for many behavioral problems, it turns out that self-esteem just isn’t an issue. For example, research has shown that there is no link between a teen’s self-esteem and problematic behaviors like stealing, excessive drinking and promiscuity. Going back to the playground, bullies have been shown to be even surer of themselves than their peers, rather than the pitiable, doubt-stricken souls we might otherwise imagine them to be. Moreover, neither a person’s job performance nor their relationship skills are affected by their level of self-esteem. Employees with a high self-esteem, for example, don’t necessarily outperform others in either their jobs or in laboratory tasks. What’s more, psychological programs that aim to boost students’ self-esteem do nothing to improve their performance in school. In fact, when struggling college students received messages intended to bolster their self-esteem, they actually did even worse in the exams that followed. It would seem that people with high self-esteem can have problems, too. If we’re interested at all in the taxonomy of our problems, then we’ll have to look for something better than the catch-all “self-esteem.” Here’s a question: in what way are a bullied school kid and an aspiring executive the same? Answer: both are likely to be told to be more assertive. Meek people – that is, gentle-natured people who will not fight or compete if they can avoid it – can profit from assertiveness training, enabling them to better stand up for themselves. Sometimes, however, behaving more assertively can be overkill. In fact, high assertiveness comes with considerable social costs. For instance, highly assertive people are considered by their peers to be less friendly, and also enjoy less popularity. And because extremely assertive people tend to strive to achieve their goals irrespective of the interests of those around them, they are more prone to insult or annoy others and even inadvertently isolate themselves from their peers. Imagine, for example, a highly assertive kid who insists on playing soccer even though all his friends would rather play detective. He may eventually get what he wants, but it’s equally possible that he just pushes his friends away. This is just as true in the business world as it is on the playground, as was demonstrated in one study where participants were asked to assess their managers’ leadership abilities. They found that extremely assertive managers tended to be rated as poorer readers – just like their meeker counterparts. In addition, assertiveness can disrupt the flow of any social group. Indeed, the group just can’t get anything done if everyone is trying to push through their own agendas. If no one is willing to give others the upper hand, to compromise, cooperate or yield to an authority, then things will quickly devolve into drawn-out power struggles, which waste the group’s time and energy. Just imagine that you’re in a group working on a short film: if no one is willing to make compromises, then you may never even get past the planning stage and actually start filming! Regrettably, a strong ego and a strong will are not the solutions for every problem. This complicates our most important task: managing our fates. The following blinks show how this works. At one point or another, we’ve all heard some tear-jerking story about cancer patients who, by visualizing imploding malignant cells or working their way through childhood trauma, find themselves tumor-free with a long, healthy life ahead of them. But did those people really “think away” their illness? And what about the countless other people who finally succumbed to their illnesses: did they bring it upon themselves by thinking the wrong thoughts? The reality is quite straightforward: psychotherapy and meditation don’t affect disease progression or survival rates in cancer patients. This is evidenced by several well-designed studies that set out to find any demonstrable effect psychotherapy might have on the survival rates of those suffering from cancer. According to most of the studies, there was absolutely no effect on survival. It should be noted, however, that therapy did significantly improve the patients’ quality of life. Likewise, meditation had no effect on the progression of the disease. It did, however, help to reduce the pain brought on by the disease and the treatment. All of this is not too surprising really, since a cancer patients’ attitude does not influence their prognosis. For example, studies show that a patient’s chances of recovery are completely unaffected by her mood or attitude. Likewise, large studies have found no evidence that a fighting spirit helps patients to reduce recurrence rates or even survive longer. While it would certainly be wonderful if we could overcome our maladies by sheer thought alone, statistically speaking, this happens at best only rarely. It’s more likely to be coincidence. Have you ever seen one of those horror movies where an excited, good-natured mother gives birth to an evil child? Thankfully, this can’t happen in real life: a child’s personality isn’t predetermined, and depends mostly on his upbringing – or does it? Actually, our personalities are strongly influenced by our genetic makeup. Identical twins, for example, share many personality traits even if they are raised apart. In fact, their personality traits, such as their their degree of self-control, correlate 75 percent of the time when they are raised apart and an astounding 85 percent of the time when they are raised in the same home. These statistics suggest that only a fraction of the variations between them depend on how the twins were raised in their separate homes. However, it is quite clear that a child’s development can be impaired by abuse or neglect. But it’s not always the case that parenting influences a child’s character. Sometimes it’s the other way around! This can lead investigators to overestimate a parent’s influence over their child’s development. This is because parents adapt their parenting style to a child’s inborn traits. For example, it’s possible that naturally compliant children are punished less than their headstrong siblings simply because they’ll behave well anyway. Scientists might then erroneously conclude that a non-authoritative parenting style leads to compliance in children. Thus, even when there are correlations between parenting styles and a child’s behavior, you can’t necessarily determine the cause, i.e., whether the child or the parent has more influence over the child’s outcomes. In addition, when environment does actually affect a child’s development, there’s more to that environment than just the family. Parents, therefore, are not always responsible for these developments. For many hours a day, kids are exposed to other children, teachers and media. We cannot hold parents completely responsible for the impact of extrafamilial environments, as there is much that lies beyond their control. For example, even in a carefully chosen school, you can’t necessarily avoid the ridicule of bullies. If you’ve ever flipped through any self-help manual you probably found “advice” that reads something like this: With the right mindset and lots of practice, you can accomplish anything! What a load of rubbish! The fact is that there are some goals that are simply out of your reach. While it’s true that everyone has untapped potential, there are also limitations that even superhuman willpower can’t transcend. Firstly, what if you were just born with the wrong body type? A girl who doesn’t have a petite frame will never become a Bolshoi ballerina, no matter how hard she tries. Secondly, what if you were born without any natural talent in a particular field? Becoming the world’s best would be out of the question. But let’s say that you want to try anyway: Do you have the determination necessary to practice for the 10,000 hours that experts consider the minimum requirement for outstanding performance? What’s more, it’s logically impossible for everyone to be better than all competitors in a given field. Imagine, for example, that five girls all want to win a race. So they all follow the advice from pop-psych books – put in 10,000 hours of practice and develop iron determination. But by definition, only one person can win a race! Four of them will be losers. Finally, you aren’t 100 percent in control of yourself – there’s always the influence of other people. While self-help books will tell you that no one can make you feel a particular emotion, in actuality, we’re hard-wired to respond to others. In fact, our brains are outfitted with a specialized set of neurons called mirror neurons, that react to and reproduce people’s body language. For example, when another person is crying, you’ll feel like crying yourself. In addition, we react to other people’s expectations of us without even knowing it. When investigators randomly pointed out average pupils as “gifted” to their teachers, these students began objectively outperforming their peers without any idea that they were labeled as “gifted.” Imagine an obsessed man who runs after every car he sees driving down his road, just to make sure it doesn’t hit a pothole. Sounds crazy, right? Of course! It is utterly exhausting and impossible to stop a car hitting a bump in the road. But when you think about it, trying to control your life is just as futile. In fact, there are a number of downsides to believing that you determine your fate. For example, if you perceive all your daily choices as having life-altering consequences, then you may feel reluctant to make any spontaneous decisions, as any mistake might be fatal in the long run. Apart from provoking severe anxiety, this outlook will also stifle your creative process, since creativity involves freely spontaneous and non-evaluative thought. Furthermore, if you believe that you can determine everything, then you’ll consequently feel responsible for every single mishap in your life. Indeed, someone who believes that it’s up to him to determine how any situation unfolds will work incessantly to make sure he gets everything perfect. But he still can’t pull it off, and this can put him under immense pressure. For example, if someone feels responsible for her spouse’s feelings, then she’ll obsess over the fact that her loved one is feeling down. She’ll brood over possible mistakes she made and become obsessed with correcting them, taking drastic measures like painting the bedroom in their favorite color just to make them smile. Moreover, sometimes it’s just bad to believe that people can fix all their problems. For example, as we saw, people can’t conquer cancer with thoughts alone. To suggest they can is to make them feel unjustly responsible for their own suffering. Indeed, if you believe you could heal yourself but continue to experience symptoms, then you might feel like an utter failure. What’s worse, you might also fail to seek timely medical help. Instead, we should follow the advice of the Greek philosopher Epictetus: “There is only one way to happiness ... cease worrying about things that are beyond the power of your will.” But if we can’t control our lives as much as we’d like to, we can at least be the masters of our own minds – right? These final blinks will answer that very question. If you want to make positive changes in your life, why not try to change your mind itself? Why don’t you try Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) to reprogram your brain? What is NLP exactly? NLP is a practice based on the belief that all high-functioning people have specific thinking habits, and that anyone can become higher-functioning if they learn to think like a successful person. Alas, NLP doesn’t work. In fact, studies show that NLP is ineffective both in enhancing human performance and as a therapeutic tool. For example, one foundational belief in NLP is that we can replicate an expert’s performance by emulating her expert knowledge and imitating her thinking habits. Not so! Expert knowledge isn’t just a compendium of rules, but rather a set of highly developed skills. And even the simplest of skills, like riding a bike, can’t be acquired without practice. Another NLP technique is changing the way you talk by calling setbacks “feedback” rather than “failures” in order to raise your morale. This is pretty misguided. If you want to become a skilled singer and your neighbors offer you $1,000 not to sing for one week, then you could optimistically take this failure as feedback that you don’t yet sing very well, and you’ll have to practice much harder to reach your goal of serenading them. But what if you are a lifeguard, and tragically fail to rescue a drowning child. Can you consider this death mere “feedback” on your skills as a lifeguard? No! That’s because feedback is for ourselves alone, our failures affect others, too. Your neighbors had to listen to your terrible singing, after all. Real failure hurts. It’s not just some useful information to help you succeed. It should motivate you to reconsider your values, and not merely adjust your strategy in pursuit of your goal. Have you ever wondered what causes your feelings and behavior? Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, maintains that both are caused by our thoughts. Consequently, behind every problematic behavior or negative emotion there’s bound to be some unhelpful thought. Thus to overcome your problem, you’ll first have to find, explore and alter that thought. However, CBT’s assumptions are deeply flawed. It is often our emotions that precede our thoughts, not the other way round. For example, if you’re arachnophobic and spot a huge, hairy, disgusting tarantula on the seat next to you, you’ll first be flooded with panic before your brain even produces the word “tarantula.” CBT also wrongly assumes that what filters through from our subconscious takes the form of a proposition. However, it could just as well be an abstract image. For example, rather than thinking “I’m completely helpless” in times of desperation, you might instead fleetingly visualize yourself as having no hands – it’s quite difficult to reason with an image. Furthermore, CBT assumes that we should simply change negative thoughts that are irrational. In reality, those thoughts belong to a whole network of other thoughts and memories. Uprooting them is like taking apart our lives, so we’re sometimes reluctant to change them. Also – just like fleas – if you spot one there are probably hundreds. When a depressed person thinks “I’m useless,” it’s not just connected to a network of other thoughts, it’s also more likely to be connected to negative beliefs and painful memories. Challenging one negative belief means challenging potentially hundreds, and this is no easy task. Consequently, CBT isn’t always effective. In fact, while studies show that patients exhibiting symptoms of anxiety do moderately improve through CBT, roughly three quarters still experience significant symptoms, and the statistics are even worse for those suffering from depression. Is it possible to be a pessimistic curmudgeon and still live a good life? And can the power of positive thinking lift someone out of depression? Studies show that people who already feel bad may feel even worse if they are confronted with positive affirmations. In one study, after repeating the positive mantra “I am a lovable person,” participants with a low self-esteem actually felt worse. But why? The researchers believe that these counterintuitive results occur because the participants don’t actually believe the mantras, and they thus trigger contradictory thoughts, such as, “That’s not true; I’m not lovable at all.” Of course, this isn’t an argument against positive thinking per se, but rather against parroting positive affirmations that you don’t believe – a tactic advocated by too many self-help manuals. Conversely, people in bad moods are actually less prone to mental errors. This was evidenced by one study in which subjects watched movies aimed at lifting or dampening their moods, and were then asked to complete several mental tasks, such as judging the truth of rumors. Compared to their happy counterparts, those with dampened spirits were better focused, less gullible and made fewer mistakes. Positive thinking itself can even be dangerous, if overdone. Then it becomes denial, and denial can breed problems. This is because sometimes the most realistic take on a situation is a negative one. Just think of the sinking Titanic: until the bitter end, many passengers held on to the belief that the ship was unsinkable. While this denial might have been good for passengers trying to cope with their impending doom, denial in other situations can prevent you from dealing with a problem that requires action. For example, if you experience the early symptoms of diabetes, you really ought to see your doctor rather than pretend that nothing is wrong. Positive thinking, while not inherently bad, isn’t always healthy, helpful or rational. Sometimes it’s the grumpy pessimist who is more realistic than all those Pollyannas out there. The key message in this book: The self-help industry promises simple solutions to all our problems. However, many of its suggestions don’t stand up to closer scrutiny. In fact, the prevailing message that “we could do better” might make us anxious that being a regular person with reasonable success just isn’t good enough. Actionable advice: Wait until you’re in a foul mood to make important decisions. In spite of the claims that positive thinking will make everything in your life better, it turns out that there are some times where it’s better to be a grouch. In fact, studies show that we make our best decisions when we’re down in the dumps, as sad people are more conscientious and less gullible than their happy counterparts. Suggested further reading: The Antidote The Antidote is the intelligent person’s guide to understanding the much-misunderstood idea of happiness. The author emphasizes that positive thinking isn’t the solution, but part of the problem. He outlines an alternative, “negative” path to happiness and success that involves embracing failure, pessimism, insecurity and uncertainty – what we usually spend our lives trying to avoid.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Whether we’re dealing with technology, work or even politics, the ground seems constantly to be shifting beneath our feet. As a result, we face new challenges on a daily basis, and we have to continuously adapt if we want to be successful. Of course, this is easier said than done. How do you do it? The secret lies in implementing the strategies that will enable you to perpetually reinvent yourself. By doing this, you can put yourself in a position to conquer the challenges of modern life. As the proverb goes, if the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. The world isn’t going to adapt to you – so it’s time for you to start adapting to it. In these blinks, you will learn what Pope Francis and Eminem can teach us about the best ways to deal with suffering; how being broke can be a blessing in disguise; and how to wake up every morning with a sense of excitement for the day ahead. Once upon a time, the road to success was straightforward: you earned a degree, landed a stable job and saved up for a comfortable retirement. This road has become a thing of the past, and yet many people are still trying to follow it – saddling themselves with debt from student loans, credit cards and mortgages along the way. The old road is no longer viable because in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing world there simply isn’t a linear, fixed and preestablished route to success; you need to blaze your own path. One of the keys to doing so is to avoid letting your degree or job title define you. Consider a company that exemplifies reinvention: Google. Catching up with a friend who works at Google, the author asked, “What are the latest projects your company is working on?” The author expected them to be search-related. But, actually, they were totally different: building an automated car, developing a bracelet to cure cancer and connecting remote areas to Wi-Fi through stratospheric balloons. In other words, Google doesn’t let its “job” (providing a search engine) define it. Google’s cofounder Larry Page doesn’t let his degree define him, either. He majored in computer science, but his job today isn’t about tinkering with software; it’s about solving major societal problems.    Of course, breaking free of the confines of your degree or job title is easier said than done. Fortunately, just because you have to blaze your own path doesn’t mean you have to go it alone; mentors can provide guidance. Here are some steps to finding them. First, do some research on a person you respect and want to learn from. Read her bio. Check out articles she’s written or interviews she’s given. Next, contact her with ideas that might help her. For example, when the author was seeking mentorship from someone who had written an academic article, he didn’t just read the article; he sent feedback, thus providing value as a mentee. As you continue on your journey, provide your mentor with progress updates every three months. That way, she can see her influence on you in action and feel appreciated. Finally, don’t just seize opportunities to meet up with your mentor; create those opportunities. It might even be worth going so far as to fly to another country and send her a message saying you’re available to discuss an idea further! Some of history’s most creative people have also been the most prolific. Pablo Picasso created 50,000 works of art, which averages at two per day. Jimi Hendrix recorded enough music to fill nearly 70 albums, despite living only 27 years. Now, you don’t need to churn out work every minute to be creative – but high production can help you sharpen your talents. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. The writer Barbara Cortland provides an inspirational example of how much you can accomplish if you put in enough work. In 1983, she set the world record for writing the most novels in a single year: an astounding 23. Her passion was writing about romance, and she pursued it every day. Thanks to her dedication, she published 723 novels and sold 600 million copies of them. The rapper Coolio provides another example. As a child, he set his heart on becoming a famous rapper. To that end, he wrote lyrics on a daily basis, beginning at the age of 14. For the next 17 years, he continued to practice and refine his craft. Finally, in 1994, his perseverance paid off with his first big hit, “Fantastic Voyage.” The next year, his perseverance paid off even more with “Gangsta’s Paradise,” which, at the time, became the number-one song in the world. In theory, you could follow Coolio’s lead by taking any skill and practicing it until you achieve your breakthrough. But how do you decide which one to practice? How can you tell which one lies in the direction of your calling? One way is to recall your childhood and ask yourself: What did I love doing or dream of doing back then? Which activity made me lose my sense of time while doing it or imagining doing it? There lies your calling. It might not seem practicable – but even if it was childish, it can still give you a starting point from which to set out.    Chip Conley, the head of hospitality at Airbnb, for instance, was led into his career in the hospitality industry by recollecting the hours he would spend imagining he was running a restaurant as a child. And a friend of Chip’s went from being a dissatisfied lawyer to a world-renowned pastry chef by remembering the pastime of her six-year-old self: making mud pies! Imagine if every morning, you woke up feeling so motivated and excited about the day ahead that you practically bolted out of bed. Does this sound like a dream compared to your present reality? If so, it’s a sign that you need to identify the goals and activities that will fill you with a burning desire to start your day and pursue your passions. Once kindled, this desire will give you the drive to overcome the obstacles in your path – a power that’s exemplified by the story of Wayne Dyer. To say the odds were stacked against him would be an understatement; he was an orphan who spent his childhood bouncing between foster homes. Nonetheless, he was able to earn a PhD in educational counseling and become a professor. He then wrote his first book, Your Erroneous Zones, which eventually sold a whopping 35 million copies. But his journey from orphanhood to best-selling author wasn’t a smooth one. At first, his book sold only 5,000 copies, which he considered a failure. However, rather than give up, he decided to buy all of the unsold books from his publisher and go on a cross-country adventure, visiting bookstores in person to convince them to sell his book. To market his book, he also tried to appear on national television – only to be rejected by the producers of every show he approached. But once again, he refused to give up; instead, he drove from station to station and promoted his book face-to-face. Thanks to his tenacity, he was able to take his initial sales numbers and multiply them by 7,000! Empowered by a burning desire like Wayne Dyer’s, you’ll be able not only to overcome your obstacles, but also to conquer your fear of failure. To see the importance of doing so, consider the Rolling Stones. Two of its founding members, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, were childhood friends who were brought back together by the passion they shared for music, which led them to form the band. The rest is history, right? Well, not quite. At first, music critics panned their songs. Reviewers derided Mick Jagger’s voice, which they said was “fuzzy and undisciplined . . . complete chaos.” But the band didn’t give up. Instead, they welcomed every gig that came their way, performing 200 concerts per year, despite earning little money from them and attracting audiences as small as four people. It was their zeal for music that enabled them to overcome their fear of failure and to become one of the most successful bands of all time. Imagine a world without borders – one where trade flows freely between nations, innovation flourishes in its wake and people extend their generosity to everyone, overcoming their ethnic, racial and social divisions. Wouldn’t this be an ideal world to live in? Well, it may take many years for this vision of the world to be realized, but we can still live by the values that animate it in the here and now by continually striving to benefit others. One person who embodies such a spirit of generosity is Pope Francis. Here is just one example. A young woman became pregnant, and her husband pressured her to have an abortion. Wanting to keep the baby, she divorced him. Afterward, she sank into depression. Desperate, she sent a letter to the pope. A few weeks later, her phone rang – and, to her surprise, it was Pope Francis himself! He comforted her over the phone, and later he even baptized the baby himself. If you think about it, such an act of kindness is remarkable. After all, the pope leads an enormous, nearly 2,000-year-old institution. Nonetheless, he frequently takes time to call the ordinary people who write to him, just to bring some happiness into their lives. Such acts of kindness earn the pope plenty of adulation – but rather than basking in it, he actively discourages us from viewing him as some sort of moral Superman. Instead, he reminds us that he is a human being who laughs and cries just like us. Why is that truth important? Because the flip side is that we are just as capable of kindness as he is. Now, it’s clear that we should try to alleviate other people’s pain – but what should we do about our own pain? One answer is to channel it into our passions. Someone who did that to great effect was the rapper Eminem. Growing up in a poor family in a trailer park, he suffered many tribulations, which continued into his young adulthood with a slew of familial betrayals and bad jobs. However, rather than stewing in his troubles, he used them as grist for his creative mill – transforming them into material for the rap lyrics that would eventually propel him from underground rap battles in Detroit to worldwide superstardom, with 220 million record sales under his belt. Imagine you’ve sparked your burning desire and identified the talent that represents your calling. Mission accomplished, right? Well, not quite. You’ve ignited your inner fire, but now you need to keep fueling it. One way of doing so is to keep practicing. Now, habitual practice takes great willpower. That’s why determination is the key to success; without it, your talent will peter out before it’s taken you far. Consider Serena Williams. She’s extremely talented at tennis, but she didn’t acquire her talents overnight. It took her years of hard work to develop them. When she was only three years old, she started a daily training regimen with her father. By the time she turned ten, she’d achieved her first success: playing in the junior circuit. But she didn’t stop there. She kept practicing and competing – and after devoting 30 years of her life to tennis, she had the goods to show for it: 23 Grand Slam titles to date, more than any other player in the world. On the opposite end of the physicality spectrum, consider the author Charles Bukowski. When he was young, he managed to get only two stories published. Then, he stopped writing for a decade. No determination, no success. But then he returned to writing with a newfound sense of resolve. For 15 years, he wrote stories and poems every single day, and he submitted thousands of them to every publication possible, enabling him to live off his writing. With his first novel, Post Office, he finally attained success. He was 49 years old. Besides challenges, there’s another form of kindling that can feed your inner fire: being broke. While this might seem like the opposite of success, it can also help you to achieve it. Consider the story of Daymond John. When he was young, his mother taught him how to sew wool hats. After sewing 80 of them, he sold them for $10 each, bringing in a total of $800 – a significant sum for them at the time, since they were strapped for cash. His fire was sparked, and he started fueling it right away. Eventually, he started the clothing brand FUBU. Within a few years, the company achieved $350 million in sales. Ten years later, it was worth $6 billion. Dedication brought him to that achievement – but being broke gave him the drive to start down his path to success. Every business has a set of values, and those values are embodied in its goals, which could range from boosting customers’ confidence to providing them with healthy, delicious food. Like a business, your values are what guide you on your journey toward success. Also like a business, if you lose sight of them, you run the risk of losing your way. That’s what often befalls family-run businesses; they go under by the third generation. Why? Well, they begin with a set of guiding values – providing upward mobility to their employees, perhaps, or ensuring customer satisfaction. The founder tries to pass those values down to her successors, but with each new generation, they get weaker and weaker. How can this be avoided? Dick Yuengling provides one answer. His family-run brewing company, D.G. Yuengling & Son, is still going strong, despite having reached its fifth generation of ownership. What’s his secret? Well, he set up his company in a novel way: instead of simply inheriting it, each new generation must purchase it from the previous one. Having to literally invest themselves in the company, the new owners are naturally led to reevaluate its values as they figure out how they want to run it. By keeping sight of your values, you too can keep your eye on the prize: your goals. But that’s not enough. To truly make progress, you also have to ensure you‘re making decisions that help you grow. Every time you make a decision in your career or business, you should ask yourself, “Was my decision fear-based or growth-oriented?” Many decisions are made out of fear. The author himself once took a job simply because he feared going broke, even though he didn’t feel any passion for the position itself. When you make a fear-based decision, it generally points toward an underlying insecurity. For example, you might stay in a job you hate because you’re afraid you won’t find another one. It’s natural to make such fear-based decisions, but it’s also inadvisable. In the author’s experience, they always lead to regret. But it’s never too late to reverse course. After just three days into the job he took out of fear, the author simply got up and walked off into the proverbial sunset. As he left, he felt a profound sense of empowerment and freedom. That’s not to say everything was easy for him from there on out. Moving forward, he often had money troubles. But his growth-oriented decision to quit his job enabled him to begin his journey toward becoming the successful author he is today. The key message in these blinks: In today’s fast-paced world, the only constant is change. Companies go bankrupt, technologies become obsolete and governments change their policies. To succeed in such a world, we must master the art of reinventing ourselves in order to navigate our way through the ever-shifting seas of the modern world and reach the shores of success.  Actionable advice: Every day, write down ten ideas on new ways you could pursue your passions.    If you get into the daily habit of writing down ten ideas per day, you’ll generate 3,650 ideas in a single year. Whether it’s about the business you want to start, the novel you want to write or the public-speaking skills you want to develop, each of these ideas will represent one possible path you could take toward achieving your goals and living out your passions. Out of all those ideas, at least one or two of them are bound to take you closer to where you want to be! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

One thing is certain, however: you’re not the only person who’s ever been rejected. Rejection in business or in life is common. Whether you’re passed up at a dance audition, turned down for the baseball team or ignored by potential investors, it’s all too easy to let rejection drain your spirits and make you give up. These blinks will show that letting rejection rule you is a big mistake. If you look at rejection from a different perspective, you’ll discover that there’s a lot to learn from it. And it isn't just about learning how to be more successful; it’s about growing as a human being. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the author decided to go on a 100-day rejection journey; why evolution has made us so scared of rejection; and how basketball star Stephon Marbury became a legend in China. Picture this scenario. You’ve a great, six-figure job at a Fortune 500 company, a wonderful spouse and own a 3,700-square-foot house. Sounds pretty fantastic, right? This was the author’s life, yet he was still unhappy because he was too scared to realize his true calling: to become a world-class entrepreneur.    It’s not so hard to get yet another job or promotion, but not pursuing your lifelong dream is a heavy burden to bear. The author’s wife realized that he was unhappy, and advised him to take six months off to set up his dream company and work as hard as he could to make it a success. If by the end of the period the company still had no investors, he could always go back to his old career. This deadline approach is effective, as it minimizes risk and forces you to set fixed goals and time limits. After a trial period, you can either keep going, or call it off. To better your chances of success, though, you need another trick up your sleeve. You have to find your own way of handling rejection. The author’s vision was to create a personal development app that helped people achieve their goals. As a newbie entrepreneur, the author assembled a team of skilled engineers to build the gamification app of which he had dreamed. But still, he needed an investor to get his company off the ground. He and his team rehearsed their sales pitch for weeks, yet in the end, the investor unfortunately said “no.” The author found he wasn’t very good at dealing with rejection. So to deal with his fear head-on, he resolved to embark on a 100-day rejection journey, blogging and recording video to chronicle his experience. Though the author’s journey was unorthodox, the lessons he learned during his challenge are certainly applicable to anyone who wants to better understand and cope with rejection. To begin to deal with rejection, you have to first understand the psychology behind the phenomenon. For example, why is rejection still a social taboo? And why does it feel so painful? Our fear of rejection is rooted in our biology and reinforced by our instinct to stay alive. When you feel physical pain, your brain releases opioids – the body’s natural painkillers – to help you cope. In a recent experiment, researchers at the University of Michigan Medical School wanted to see if the brain would release opioids if the stimulus was instead a rejection. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that the brains of people who experienced a rejection indeed released opioids, just as they would had the subject suffered actual physical trauma. It’s probably no surprise that being rejected sits on the top-ten list of people’s greatest fears. But why is that? The distress associated with rejection actually has an evolutionary foundation. Fear has always been necessary for the survival of the species. Being ostracized by our peers or protectors would leave us to face dangerous animals or environments alone, potentially leading to injury or death. No wonder we’re terrified of rejection! Yet to truly understand rejection, it’s also necessary to distinguish it from failure. While we might see failure as unfortunate yet understandable due to factors outside our control, rejection instead feels personal, since it’s another person who is saying “no,”  and frequently doing so face-to-face.   The nature of rejection involves an unequal exchange, between the rejector and the rejected. And of course it’s the rejected person who takes the biggest hit. Unlike failure, it’s hard to blame rejection on external factors, such as the market or the economy. It’s true that fear might have saved our ancestors’ skins, but today it’s more handicap than precaution. So to understand the positive aspects of rejection, we need to reframe our concept of it. Think of all the amazing, potentially life-changing ideas and opportunities that you didn’t act on for fear of rejection. To overcome your fears, you have to see rejection not as an objective final verdict about you but as the subjective opinion of others. You must realize that different people will respond to the same request in many different ways. It’s not the whole universe evaluating your skills and abilities, but a diverse array of people with varied backgrounds, personalities and ambitions. Rejection is just one of many human interactions in which at least two parties are involved and because of this, every interaction is going to be unique and will often lead to a different outcome. As part of his rejection journey, the author decided to explore rejection in the context of applying for a job. He decided to try to find a job for one day by personally introducing himself to different companies. In his first two attempts, he was rejected by office managers who brusquely informed him that he couldn’t just drop by and apply for a job. In his third attempt, however, the author met a friendly manager who offered him a job at her technology firm on the spot. So you see, facing rejection is a matter of simply trying again, even if it takes several attempts. In fact, you should bear in mind that rejection always has a number. Though it seems odd at first, it’s possible to get a “yes” just by talking to enough people. Because people’s opinions vary, eventually you are bound to find a person who can fulfill your request. Take best-selling author J.K. Rowling, for instance. In 1995, she submitted her first Harry Potter manuscript to 12 British publishers and all 12 rejected it. Yet, when Rowling’s work was eventually picked up by publisher Bloomsbury, the book went on to sell over 100 million copies. Rejection, then, is subjective. Avoid treating other people’s opinions of you as the final word on your character and what you have to offer! Sometimes after a rejection, we want the ground to swallow us up. At the very least, it’s tempting to make a swift exit from the scene. But wait! There is value in resisting the urge to run. Now is your chance to find out the reason behind the rejection. It’s a good idea to stick around and ask why you were turned down. This makes a rejection easier to deal with, and helps you formulate a more successful strategy next time. This is similar to “retreat or rout” tactics in military warfare. A retreat is a withdrawal to regroup, and is usually temporary. A rout, on the other hand, is a disordered and confused running away, a breakdown of discipline and morale. Therefore, an orderly retreat is far more desirable. Retreating means asking questions about a rejection to help you regroup and adapt your approach, according to the answers you receive. In addition to asking questions and tweaking your approach, frequently changing the audience, environment and circumstances for your pitch to will increase your chances of getting a “yes.” This effective approach involves posing your request to different people, rather than trying to repeatedly hammer home one idea to the same person. Take the case of basketball star Stephon Marbury. Getting to the top wasn’t easy, and he had lots of trouble along the way. In 2007, Marbury sank into a deep depression when his father died and his shoe company Starbury failed. After switching teams and arguing frequently with coaches and team members, he was essentially forced out of the professional league. But Marbury found a new calling, and took his career to China. In the new, different environment of Beijing, Marbury was an instant success, so much so that he became a local legend and is now even the subject of a theater musical. Before getting out there and gathering as many “yes” responses as you possibly can, you first need to learn the fundamentals of decision making. First, being authentic and disclosing the reason behind your request will greatly increase the chance of receiving a “yes.” In 1978, Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer carried out a study that proved the effectiveness of providing a reason behind a request. In her experiment, she approached people waiting in line to use a copying machine and asked if she could skip the line to make her copies first. She wanted to see if her reasons and the way she phrased the request had an immediate effect on the person’s response. She found that it did. If Langer offered an explanation, even a trivial one, to jump the line, the percentage of people willing to let her do so rose significantly. As well as being open about the motivation behind your request, acknowledging other people’s doubts will also, surprisingly, put you in their favor. In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences, Domino’s Pizza ranked at the bottom. Domino’s knew it desperately had to change, so the company completely overhauled its menu and pizza recipes. When it came to the advertising campaign to launch its new image, however, Domino’s was bold and openly slammed the former quality of its pizzas, as based on actual customer complaints. In addition to understanding other’s doubts, be sure to pitch to the right audience. Failing to do this can yield underwhelming results. One social experiment conducted by The Washington Post and violinist Joshua Bell aimed to find out how many people would recognize the musical prowess of a world-class musician if he played incognito in a New York subway station. Guess how many people stopped to listen to Bell’s 45-minute performance? A grand total of six. Talent and brilliance don’t matter if you’re targeting the wrong audience in the wrong setting. Rejection is based on a host of factors that aren’t necessarily about you. Although hurt feelings might be inevitable, a rejection doesn’t have to be a completely negative experience. Each rejection has an upside, if you’re willing to look for it! You can use rejection to motivate and increase your ability to work on even greater goals. Take NBA basketball legend Michael Jordan. When Jordan was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009, most people expected a run-of-the-mill acceptance speech. But Jordan’s talk was everything but ordinary. Jordan itemized every personal rejection he had ever received in his career, and what it had done to motivate him. He recounted everything from not being selected for varsity by his high school coach to journalists who said he’d never see the kind of success as players like Magic Johnson. Jordan concluded that each rejection had actually fed him and his goal of becoming the top-ranking player in U.S. professional basketball. In addition to being highly motivating, rejection might just be the mark of a radically creative idea, especially when the rejection is heavily influenced by a “herd mentality” or conventional thinking. Throughout history, we have seen countless examples of rejection signifying that someone is well ahead of the curve in terms of discovery and innovation. Galileo is a remarkable example of this. In 1610, Galileo published his work Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), offering his heliocentric theory in which the sun sat in the center of our known universe. Galileo's discoveries were vehemently opposed by the Catholic Church, and Inquisition authorities banned the idea of heliocentrism, ordering Galileo to refrain from defending it. But as we know now, his ideas turned out to be not only correct but also revolutionary. People face rejection everywhere and every day, from amateur entrepreneurs being shown the door to beggars in the street addressing passers by who won’t even look at them. So what can we learn from daily rejection? Rejection and suffering can be viewed as tools to better understanding people. As part of his rejection challenge, the author spent time with beggars and panhandlers and experienced firsthand what it felt like to be rejected constantly and often cruelly. It was the most taxing part of his journey, but through it, he became more empathetic. One of the people the author spent time with, a man named Frank, related an incredible story. He had served in Vietnam until he suffered an injury, which prevented him from fighting further. Frank waited a long time for the government to upgrade his veteran disability benefits so that he could cover more than just the costs of his food and shelter. The author decided to share Frank’s ordeal in his book to help him get the money he needed to make a better living. Rejection doesn’t just foster empathy; it can also teach you how much your dream really means to you. Before comedian Louis C.K. became famous, he struggled for eight years performing stand-up comedy in an obscure Boston nightclub. One night, the director of Saturday Night Live was in town to scout for new talent. He selected every comic who auditioned, except Louis C.K. Although the rejection stung, Louis C.K. saw his failed audition as an opportunity to really think about whether he wanted to pursue a career in comedy. He eventually got his break and was hired by late-night host Conan O’Brien as a writer for the show. We define ourselves through our reactions to our experiences. Using rejection wisely, we can understand others better and can choose to continue our mission or find a new calling. Overcoming rejection encourages you to take more risks in life. But it’s not just about external outcomes. You have to look inside and value yourself before you seek approval from others. The trouble is, we’re not brought up to think like this. As children, we are taught that we have to fulfill other people’s wishes, especially the wishes of our parents. But this incessant approval-seeking bleeds into other areas of our life too, and we end up wanting everyone to accept us, in our social circles and in business. Yet constant approval-seeking leads us astray from living fulfilled lives and staying true to who we really are. Your goal should be to feel comfortable in your own skin. That is, acceptance by others is not the purpose of your rejection journey. Once you value yourself, enjoying long-term success also means being able to detach yourself from the outcome. Concentrating on factors within your control, such as your effort and behavior, will promote greater success in the long term. The benefit of focusing on controllable variables means you won’t waste your energy on fretting about the unknown future. Take John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach who won ten collegiate championships over 11 years. He never rallied his team by ranting about winning or losing. All he cared about was the effort his players put into the game. Wooden was smart, as focusing on players giving their all and not agonizing over results led the coach to groundbreaking success with his team. The key message in this book: Rejection happens every day, but how you interpret rejection is up to you. As you begin to embrace rejection and learn from it, it can help you refine your goals and become one of the strongest driving forces behind living the life you really want. Actionable advice: Switch up your audience or environment. The next time you get rejected, change your environment or pitch your request to a totally different group. A change of location or listener could well lead you to the results you want. Ask “why?” before you walk out. Dont leave the site of a rejection without asking why you were turned down. Getting to the bottom of why you were rejected will give you clarity and help you to improve your approach. Accept yourself first. Being authentic and confident should be your number one priority. Believing in yourself will see you through the tough times and help others see your strengths.

What does it take to overcome all the obstacles? The bottom line is that hardship is a part of life, but only by facing up to it and learning to tackle all of life’s challenges will we achieve our full potential. So how do you do that? With resilience. Author Eric Greitens, in his correspondence with fellow Navy SEAL veteran Zach, tries to find the qualities, practices and training needed to become resilient against the harder parts of life. His search took him through history, philosophy and beyond. Ultimately, it seems the ancient struggle we face as humans has a solution that’s equally ancient. In these blinks, you’ll discover how resilience helped create the first modern novel, Don Quixote; that people failing to take responsibility for their personal actions helped Nazi Germany; and how Ancient Greeks used repetitions to create resilience in both mind and body. Are you living up to your full potential? The unfortunate truth is, many of us fail to access all our energy, intelligence and compassion because we get bogged down in disappointment and failure.  But we can learn to overcome hardship by harnessing the power of resilience. Because here’s the thing: none of us can escape pain, fear or doubts. But we can refuse to let difficult experiences bring us down! The trick is to see them in the right light. Overcoming obstacles is difficult, but doing so will make you stronger. Simply put, pain builds courage. You just have to be resilient.  That’s what the author learned after spending many years working with veterans. Those brave men and women lost both limbs and friends, not to mention purpose. But by facing the loss and overcoming their pain, they transformed it into something positive. Consider the story of Redmon Ramos. After losing his leg by stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan, the former marine realized he had two choices: he could either pity himself or confront his pain. He chose the latter option and, as a result, became much stronger. With the help of prosthetics, Ramos eventually entered the US Paralympic Warrior Games and brought home several medals.  There’s a lesson here: the goal isn’t to bounce back from a hardship, but rather to move through it. History is full of similar stories – stories of people faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges and managing to use their misery to their advantage.  Consider Miguel de Cervantes, a Spaniard imprisoned in 1602. To pass time in his cell, he invented a story about an old man who believed he was a knight. Eventually, that tale evolved into the first modern novel, a work of literature beloved to this day – Don Quixote. We can all follow Cervantes’ lead and meet life’s challenges with courage and resilience. We all want fulfilling work and happy relationships. But it’s easier to want those things than to get them. And that’s because anything worth having requires lots of hard work and struggle.  But how do you know what’s worth struggling for? Well, it comes down to having a purpose. And that’s not something you can casually find. Rather, you have to forge a purpose by taking action and trying new things.  For instance, take a job in a new town where you don’t know anyone. Or try traveling abroad for the first time. Of course, these kinds of experiences can be painful; leaving your comfort zone is scary. But remember, challenges won’t hurt you – in fact, we crave them!  Consider the research done by Mihaly Cziksztentmihalyi, professor of management and psychology at Claremont Graduate University. Cziksztentmihalyi showed that the best moments of our lives aren’t passive or relaxing; rather, they’re active – when our body or mind is pushed to its limits. During this joyful state, called flow, we lose ourselves completely in whatever we’re doing. The crucial point here is that flow arises during moments of difficulty. Meaning, if we’re not being challenged – if everything in our lives is provided for – our minds deteriorate.  Just think of how the body crashes when you don’t meet its basic needs, like sleep, food and water. A similar thing happens when our mind doesn’t get what it needs – a meaningful challenge.  For instance, a 2014 Gallup study showed that after 52 weeks of unemployment, the incidence of depression shot up to 20 percent. Why? The explanation is simple: lack of purpose made people feel unneeded.  In other words, the goal of life isn’t to avoid struggle, but rather to choose meaningful challenges. Because although we can subsist without worthwhile work, we can’t flourish. Not to mention that, in the long run, lack of purpose is as dangerous as deprivation of sleep. We’ve all been through dark, painful periods characterized by relentless struggle. But how do you summon your resilience and move forward during these moments? Well, start by looking in the mirror.  Because ultimately, resilience is about taking responsibility for your actions. It’s a matter of being able to accept what you cannot change so that you can redirect your focus to things you have control over. This is an age-old strategy for dealing with life’s challenges. In medieval Spain, for instance, at a time when Jews were severely oppressed, Jewish philosopher Solomon ibn Gabirol wrote that wisdom and peace lie in “being reconciled to the uncontrollable.” And yet, although you’re not responsible for everything that happens to you, you are responsible for how you deal with it. That’s what the author realized while visiting a refugee camp, where he saw thousands of men and women struggling to come to grips with a tragic reality. And while some were beaten down by misery, others stood proud; instead of sitting around and mourning, the resilient ones taught children, organized sports games and more. The author saw that even at their most powerless, some people found an inner strength that couldn’t be taken from them. On the other hand, history shows that there are terrible consequences for refusing to take responsibility for your actions.  Consider the work of philosopher Eric Hoffer, who studies mass movements and fanaticism. When trying to understand why people would voluntarily acquiesce to tyranny, Hoffer encountered a young German who explained that he joined the Nazi party to be “free from freedom.”  For that young man and for others, passing off the heavy burden of responsibility might seem attractive. But that impulse has abetted some of the most notorious acts of tyranny and brutality the world has ever seen. Imagine a ballet show or a movie: the seeming effortlessness of the final product makes it easy to forget how much work went into it. In the same way, we often don’t realize that good habits and strong character don’t just fall from the sky, but are diligently built through practice and repetition. Look at it this way: every time we battle our fears, we become more courageous. And repetition ultimately builds resilience, which we can use to overcome hard times.  In fact, the Ancient Greeks were aware that repetition was crucial for forming human behavior. They were also aware that in order to develop a strong character and spirit, you have to train both your mind and your body. Likewise, repetition was a crucial part of physical training in Athens; the exercise regimen was structured around repeatedly lifting stones and running around and around in the sand. So all in all, if you want to evolve in a different direction, start by changing your habits. Because every time we repeat an action, we’re reinforcing a habit. If you want to become a kind person, get in the habit of being kind daily.  That’s the thing about kindness – it’s a habit anyone can cultivate. It’s a matter of treating your inner kindness as a source of strength, even if you encounter someone who makes you angry or stressed. You’d be surprised to see what effect this can have. Instead of raising your voice and getting upset, just stay calm, kind and compassionate. Chances are, the other person will start acting kindly as well.  Unfortunately, this same principle applies to our negative habits. If we’re mean every day, pretty soon we become mean. And of course, hard times make it easy to fall back into bad habits. Battle this by training even harder to build strong, positive habits. Sometimes pushing yourself by studying hard or training ferociously is painful. However unpleasant such pain may be, it’s easier to bear, because we’ve sought it out, and, of course, it’s ultimately constructive. But what about those other times – after the death of a loved one, for instance – when the pain finds us. Such tragedies may feel unbearable, but we still have to confront them.  Through his years of work with devastated veterans, the author encountered some former soldiers who tried to numb their pain with alcohol, television or reclusiveness. But the author believes that the best way to ease the pain of veterans is to challenge them. This might involve tutoring a child or training a football team – anything that helps them rebuild a sense of purpose.  Consider the story of Tim, an Iraq War veteran who was struggling to put his life back together after returning home. The author asked Tim one simple, life-changing question: “How are you going to serve again?” Tim said it was the first time since returning home that someone had asked something of him. And so today, Tim owns Patriot Commercial Cleaning, a business that employs other veterans to help them rebuild their lives and re-enter civil society.  Ultimately, you can’t live a full life without purposeful work and strong social bonds. And that’s not only a problem for veterans; living without purpose is painful for everybody. To overcome that pain, you have to find something meaningful.  That’s what the author learned from the years he spent working with veterans and also as a humanitarian aid worker: people need to serve a purpose higher than themselves, especially when things are hard. In other words, outer surface leads to inner growth. It’s like fighting fire with fire: to help someone overcome their pain and conquer the challenges they’re facing, put a new challenge before them. Remember when you learned to ride a bike? You probably fell a few times and scraped up your knees before mastering it.  That’s the case for every challenge: at first, you fall. Failure is just the reality and high-achievers have figured out how to live with it. In fact, those who excel fail more often than those who don’t, because they’ve learned to accept failure as part of the improvement process. Accordingly, they’re willing to try more things and put themselves out there, leading to even more failure. Crucially, these people don’t fail passively, instead finding a way to learn from each mistake. Many of us fear failure, so accepting it is easier said than done. For instance, many of the author’s former SEAL friends used to be great at boxing, but now they’re unwilling to step inside the ring. Why? Because after tasting success, they couldn’t deal with the prospect of losing.  Nevertheless, it’s possible to overcome the fear of failure at any age. And if you can do that, you’ll be able to try new things, have adventures and grow.  To that end, no matter how old you are, try to see yourself as a beginner. Case in point: after returning home from Iraq, the author – a former boxing champion and Navy SEAL – considered taking up the martial art tae kwon do. But he kept putting it off, wondering whether there was any point to learning a new martial art, since his boxing game was already tops. But when he finally went for it, he got his ass handed to him. Still, he greatly enjoyed learning and realized that defeat is only temporary. And in the meantime, it helps build strength, willpower and motivation.  All in all, failure is a common part of everyday life. And it’s the only way to improve. So, if you’re not failing constantly, you’re probably not trying hard enough. The key message in this book: People get better when things get hard. By using our inner strength, we can make the best out of a bad situation. It’s a matter of building up courage, strength and wisdom. In other words, it’s about becoming resilient.  Actionable advice: Exercise hard.  Find a way to push yourself physically. A truly challenging exercise regimen should push you to the breaking point. Pushing yourself regularly will not only help you feel better in your body, but also awaken your spirit and free your mind.

You lost your job, maybe, or found out that your partner is having an affair. Or maybe you’ve steered clear of the big shocks, instead enduring a lot of minor irritants, like having your bike stolen or going mind-blank in the middle of a presentation.  Even if you’re not having hard times, you probably know the feeling of stumbling because of some unforeseeable obstacle or some mistake you made. Some people call it “falling,” others call it “failing,” but either way it’s essential to human experience. In fact, in these blinks you’ll find out why being brave always entails the risk of failing. But rather than just shying away from anything that demands courage, you’ll discover that you can actually learn to rise strong.  You’ll also learn how permission slips can help you recognize your feelings; how to foster awareness with a “shitty first draft”; and what expectations or dreams you might need to abandon. Time and time again, we find ourselves in situations that require us to take risks in order to learn. Whether it means appearing unprofessional when plunging into a new leadership position at work, or being uncoordinated in front of our exercise class, learning by doing often leaves us feeling quite vulnerable.  Risking vulnerability in this way and failing can be tough. We may feel ashamed, discouraged or even decide never to leave our comfort zones ever again. But keep in mind: the best place to learn is outside the comfort zone! So it’s vital that you’re able to recover from failure. How? By rising strong.  Rising strong is a multi-step process that can help you risk vulnerability and emerge with confidence. Rather than presenting a strict formula to be undeviatingly followed, these blinks explore the basic principles of rising strong, which you can adapt to your own life. Before diving in, though, there are three things that ought to be kept in mind: Firstly, you’ve got to commit to failure in order to rise strong. This means accepting that you are likely to fail (multiple times!) but bravely agreeing to give your all nevertheless. Secondly, remember that you aren’t the only one experiencing failure. While we can’t ask other people to make our mistakes for us, we can ask our peers for advice about the learning process itself.  And finally, know that rising strong won’t just change your life. Your experiences of recovery after failure can actually have a profound impact on those around you, whether you’re aware of it or not. In this way, rising strong is incredibly powerful. Want to get started? We’ll investigate how rising strong actually works in the next blinks.  So how does one actually go about rising strong? Well, it works differently for everyone. To get you started, this blink presents a rough map of the three core steps of the rising-strong process, based on the experiences of people who have found ingenious ways to navigate dangerous waters.  The first step of the process is the reckoning. What does this entail? Well, people who rise strong are willing and able to reckon with their emotions. When something happens that triggers an emotional change in them, they take care to recognize and acknowledge this shift. Then, they take an interest in why it happens, and exhibit a boundless curiosity toward the unique connections between their emotions, thoughts and actions.  The rumble is the second step in rising strong. Rumbling is all about keeping a critical eye on your own understanding of your struggles and weaknesses. What stories do you tell yourself about times when you have suffered? If you revisit, challenge and reality-check these narratives, and are willing to dig deep into topics such as shame, guilt, heartbreak or forgiveness in order to learn more about yourself, then you are doing a fine job of rumbling.  The third step of rising strong is the revolution. This occurs when you take the insights gained from rumbling with your stories and channel them into positive changes in your life. Unlike evolutionary change, which happens little by little, rumbling can create a sweeping, radical shift in the way you live, love, lead, parent and participate in society.  Sounds like something you’d like to experience yourself? Let’s explore each of these steps in detail and see how we can integrate rising strong into our own lives. Know those people who seem to just roll with the punches? The ability of certain individuals to simply dust themselves off and keep on fighting despite the odds is a bit mystifying. But if we take a closer look, a pattern begins to emerge. These people all share one central trait: the ability to reckon with their emotions. You can learn to do so, too, by taking two steps.  The first is recognizing your emotions, a task that’s often more challenging than we realize. Why? Because we’ve trained ourselves to refuse the existence of our own feelings. When a sense of disappointment or anger washes over you, you might find yourself trying to bury the emotion with rational thoughts or distractions.  But this is futile, as we can’t just dismiss our negative emotions. If we try to do that, they accumulate and fester within us, often leading to explosive breakdowns later on. So how can we avoid this? By giving ourselves permission to feel. Literally! The author once wrote herself a physical permission slip saying: “Permission to be excited, have fun, be goofy.” Once you’ve recognized and accepted something you might be feeling, it’s time to get curious about it. This makes up the second step of reckoning with your emotions, where you investigate what’s going on inside you, and why.  It starts with asking yourself simple questions. For example: “Why am I being so harsh about everybody around me today? What’s bothering me?” Research has shown that curiosity goes hand-in-hand with creative problem-solving. So if you want to uncover clever solutions for your problems, start inquiring!  If you’re like most people, you’re constantly making up stories to make sense of the world and your place within it. Narratives like this allow us to experience a sense of purpose, belonging and identity. However, we can start to feel trapped by the stories we tell about ourselves, too.  The goal of rumbling, the second step of rising strong, helps us keep these stories in check. By scrutinizing our narratives and being honest with ourselves, we can learn far more about the way we are in the world.  Normally, when we feel pain, anger or frustration, we desperately need to make sense of what’s happening. The easiest way to do this is to tell ourselves a story that links the struggle we’re experiencing in the present to all the unhappiness we’ve lived through in the past.  Things may start to make sense, but we’re also left with a narrative that tells us we’ve been suffering our whole life, and that this suffering will continue. When rumbling, you attempt to shake up this narrative; you sniff out the conspiracies and confabulations you’ve constructed around your struggles.  The most effective way to do this is by writing out your stories into a shitty first draft. This is a rough, uncensored and emotionally-driven account of the way you see your struggle. These first drafts are easy to write, and can even take the form of a fill-in-the-blank style list. For example: The story I’m making up is: …; My emotions tell me: …; My body feels: …; My thinking seems: …; My actions are: … Such exercises give us some distance from our stories. A story on paper is easier to reflect upon and look at from a different perspective. Soon enough, the conspiracies and traps we’ve set for ourselves will become clear. These traps are precisely what make us feel stuck in life, so the more aware you are of their presence, the less likely you are to fall into them.  What does rising strong look like in action? The author illustrates her own rising-strong experience with a brief but telling story. After agreeing to speak at a conference, the author was informed by the organizers that she would have to share a hotel room with another speaker. The author didn’t feel comfortable with this, but it was made clear that demanding her own room would be out of line. So, wanting to make a good impression, the author agreed to the shared room. Her roommate turned out to be a complete disaster. She stained the hotel’s couch with her dirty boots, and ignored the no-smoking rule in the hotel, getting them both in trouble. The author was shocked – and felt as if she were being punished for agreeing to the organizer’s demands.  After presenting her speech and preparing to catch her flight home, the author began to reckon with her emotions. Noticing her own judgmental and hateful thoughts about practically everyone she saw at the airport, the author wondered why she was feeling so negative.  She began to rumble with her emotions by writing down a shitty first draft that recorded her story of the events at the conference. It wasn’t long, but all the key feelings were there: “I was easy and flexible (against my will), and instead of being appreciative, the event organizers took advantage of me.” “I was good. They were bad. It wasn’t fair and I didn’t deserve it.” After rumbling, the author had a few realizations. What she discovered about herself was simple but revolutionary: to avoid pointless and frustrating resentment, she would have to maintain her boundaries. Instead of blaming people and despairing about the unfairness of the world, she decided that, from now on, she was the one responsible for her own well-being, even when under pressure from others.  When was the last time you thought something like: “I knew this would happen!” or “Was that too much to ask?” You were probably experiencing some sort of disappointment, a feeling that we encounter quite often in both our professional and our personal lives.  Whether about a family vacation or a presentation at work, our expectations often come into existence without our even realizing it. And while having expectations is often energizing and exciting, it’s also the source of all that disappointment. When reality doesn’t match our expectations, we often get resentful or unpleasant. But it needn’t be this way! Rumbling can help us deal with disappointment by nipping unhealthy expectations in the bud. What do you expect of your co-workers or your spouse? What do you expect of yourself? And why do you expect those things? All too often, our expectations fly under the radar. It isn’t until we feel disappointed that we realize what these expectations were. The challenge is to make our expectations explicit.  So explore them, and discuss them with the people you expect things from. The author and her partner always discuss their expectations for weekends, vacations and busy work weeks, just to keep things realistic.  Expectations also play a central role when it comes to rumbling with forgiveness. Family and partnership are great sources of love – but they can be sources of hurt, too. It’s inevitable that we all have to rumble with forgiveness at certain stages in life.  Forgiveness, however, is more than just forgetting a hurtful act. Sometimes, it’s about letting certain expectations die. Perhaps it’s time for you to stop expecting your parents to be people who never make mistakes, and instead recognize them as individuals with their own struggles and weaknesses. Or maybe you need to say goodbye to your dream of a perfect, argument-free marriage. This is what allows us to let go of conflict and move forward with our relationships.  Ever had one of those moments where someone says something and it just sticks with you? At a fundraiser event for supporting the homeless, the pastor of the author’s church said something that rattled her: “When you look away from a homeless person, you diminish their humanity.” These words suddenly brought an unexplored corner of her own behavior to light. Noticing that she felt discomfort at the pastor’s words, the author began to reckon with herself. Need, privilege and judgment clashed when the author realized that she too looked away from homeless people on the street.  So, it was time for her shitty first draft: “I’m not helping other people enough. I feel shame about how much I have and how little I do, so I can’t look the folks I should be helping in the eye. DO MORE!!!” The author was rumbling with her privileged life – a life far removed from the suffering of the homeless. But she was also rumbling with her own prejudice; from a young age, she’d thought that asking for help is a sign of weakness.  Realizing that she looked down on homeless people for asking for help led the author to another epiphany. She understood that asking for help isn’t a weakness at all. In fact, it is a crucial part of the rising-strong process. Dusting yourself off after failure takes courage, and it takes even more courage to ask someone to help you.  The story of a man named Andrew provides a great example of how rumbling with accountability can restore professional relationships, even when the going gets tough.  Andrew was a senior leader at a small but successful advertising agency, and had earned himself the title of resident strategy expert at his workplace. One of his colleagues even went so far as to say: “Andrew is the reason it all works. His word is gold and everyone trusts him.”  On one occasion, however, Andrew made a huge mistake. His team, at his instruction, had worked very hard on a project, and the project failed. His co-workers were angry; their trust was shaken. Andrew had known that the project was a big risk and hadn’t communicated that knowledge to his team. Things were very tense. So how did Andrew rise strong? By rumbling with accountability and trust. As the team leader, Andrew was accountable for the project’s outcome. To deal with this failure, he needed to rumble with accountability.  Accountability is integral for any strong relationship or work culture. It requires individuals to apologize and make amends, and that takes a lot of courage. Andrew proved that he had this courage when he stood in front of his team and said, “I screwed up, and I’m sorry.”  Andrew also had to rumble with trust. Despite what we might think, trust and mistakes can coexist. All it takes is the ability to repair relationships and stay true to our values. Andrew’s willingness to admit his own mistake was a powerful demonstration of his team’s core values. His honesty even created a revolution of its own in the workplace, leading to higher levels of trust, respect and transparency.  The example of Andrew’s team shows what can happen when an organization or a group within an organization experiences a failure or a fall. In the next blink, we’ll explore in more detail what it looks like when groups use the rising-strong process. Rising strong can work wonders for individuals. But what if organizations – corporations, small businesses, schools or places of worship – made the rising-strong process part of their culture? We’d see just how powerful people within a group can be when they rise strong together.  The Daring Way is a company led by the author to help professionals face issues of vulnerability, courage and worthiness in the workplace. They do this by making rumbling a part of the workplace. Here’s how that looks: During a meeting with her team, the author realized that there was insufficient time to get through the entire agenda. So she asked if they could postpone discussion of a certain project. A team member spoke up: “When you asked if we could move this item to the end of the agenda, I made up the story that we’re moving it because it’s no longer a priority for us. That concerns me, because I’m spending 70 percent of my time on that project.” This was the team member’s shitty first draft. Recognizing this, the author responded with: “Thank you for rumbling. I moved it because it’s an issue that we can’t afford to rush through. I’d rather meet again tomorrow than give it a short shrift today.” The team member agreed, and thanked the author.  What’s the lesson here? The author realized that she should always consider how organizational decisions make team members feel, and explain her choices so that nobody feels disadvantaged. This example also shows just how effective rumbling is at preventing conflict.  In fact, the willingness to rumble about conflict, be it a missed project deadline or a financial loss, has kept the author’s team from going belly-up during a catastrophe. The conspiracies we construct in our stories about our struggles often eat away at an organization’s strength. By rumbling, a team can work on sticking together, being open about their stories and getting a fresh perspective on events that allows them to rise up after failure – together and stronger than ever.  The key message in this book: Rising strong is a process with three steps: the reckoning, the rumble and the revolution. The reckoning entails recognizing one’s own emotions and getting curious about them. Rumbling is all about questioning the stories we tell to learn more about ourselves. And finally, the revolution is the fundamental change we experience when rising up, more courageous and confident than before! Actionable advice: Rumble with your team! We’ve seen that the rising-strong process is not limited to individuals, but can also be applied to groups. To make this process more precise, here are some questions that are especially helpful in an organizational setting: What emotions are the people in our team experiencing? What do we need to get curious about? What are the stories that the team members are making up? What can these stories tell us about the relationships within the team, about communication and team culture? What are the key learnings? And how do we act on these key learnings? These questions will facilitate rumbling in your team; thoroughly answering them will bring your team closer together.

Indeed, hunting has gone a bit out of fashion and most of us forage in the supermarket instead of the forest. Nonetheless, we still do a great deal of gathering. We just gather different things. Our ancestors used to gather precious berries and roots whereas we modern humans like to hoard all kinds of useless junk. Old clothes fill our wardrobes, tchotchkes crowd our shelves, and the boxes beneath our beds or in our attics are crammed with precious junk – be it stamps, baseball cards or stuffed animals. So, perhaps it’s time to scale down and toss some of this stuff out the window. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to part with those belongings you probably don’t need, as well as how to decide which items to keep, which to toss and which items of sentimental value to let go of. You’ll also learn how the Great Depression revitalized our drive to gather; why people fear scaling down; and why a collection of tin toys is no good. Is your closet or garage overflowing with old stuff that you refuse to throw away? Or maybe you even pay for an external storage unit if you live in a city where closet space is a luxury reserved for the lucky few! If that sounds like you, you’re not alone. Keeping too much stuff has been an American trend ever since the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, people ravaged by the economic recession simply couldn’t afford to throw out anything unless it served absolutely no purpose. But, of course, old habits die hard and mentalities are naturally inherited from generation to generation. So, even when conditions improved, the mindset of keeping anything that might be even slightly useful, whether now or in the future, was passed on to the next generation. As a consequence, we’ve accumulated a lot of stuff, and what was once considered prudent thriftiness now looks more like out-of-touch greed. So you own seven sets of china and an entire wall of sneakers. That’s not unreasonable, right? Yeah, right. If you’ve realized that this hoarding mentality is ridiculous and wasteful, you’ve jumped one hurdle. But the next thing is actually to get rid of the excess, a process that can be a bit overwhelming – after all, there’s just so much stuff! To help yourself out, try creating a Scaling Down Mission Statement (SDMS). An SDMS articulates the motivation behind why you want to scale down. A sample SDMS might be something like, “My great aunt is moving into assisted living with less space, so I want to help her sort out the important belongings she’ll take with her.” If you’re struggling to put your goal into a clear one-liner like that, try jotting down just a few keywords. Maybe it’s “make room for home office” or “simple living.” Putting your ideas and goals on paper will both give you a clear destination and help you get there, too. Hopefully, the SDMS has helped you figure out your goals. Nonetheless, the execution of the plan can still be daunting. If you’re feeling apprehensive, rest assured that this is perfectly normal. Maybe you’re thinking, “But I might regret throwing this out later on!” Most people have done this – thrown something out only to regret it a few days later, so this is definitely an understandable mentality. Here’s the thing, though: if you hadn’t been rummaging through your old stuff to organize and streamline your belongings, you probably would’ve forgotten you had, or would have been unable to locate, the thing you’re now worrying about throwing out! So, dare to be bold. If you haven’t used something for five years, chances are you won’t use it in the next five, either. So chuck it! A second common apprehension is fear of the task’s overwhelming nature – the worry that it’s going to take forever to make a decision about every item. The antidote to this fear is simply to get started. Grab a bag and walk around your home with the goal of throwing out a certain number of items – maybe it’s five, maybe 25. Attack anywhere and everywhere, especially parts that look easy! Of course, you’re probably going to have difficulty parting with things that have some kind of sentimental value, especially since life circumstances are always in flux. Relationships, hobbies and jobs can change in the blink of an eye, and some things are just too difficult to shrug off and throw out. So don’t be afraid to keep things for a set amount of time, and make a decision about it once that time is up. For instance, maybe you just changed jobs and have a box filled with old meeting agendas, a coffee mug, sentimental goodbye cards and so on. Though some of that stuff might be ready for the garbage, give it a couple of months to see whether your life takes a new direction. In some cases, only time will tell. Do you have hundreds of records or books that you dread schlepping around next time you move? If you’re a collector, you probably invested countless hours and dollars into your collection, not to mention a great deal of emotional energy. Some collectors love the thrill of the hunt. Desiring that rare item, searching for weeks, months, sometimes even years, and finally getting it and adding it to the collection is a rewarding and satisfying experience. On top of that, many people view their collections as an investment. A collection might have a sum value that is greater than its parts, and it can be exciting to consider the profit you might make if you ever decided to sell. Though these seem like good reasons, let’s consider them more carefully and critically. Let’s take the careful collector who finally lands the latest set of first-edition books. Sure, she’ll be thrilled at first, but she’s likely to forget about it as soon as it’s on her shelf. Why? Because she’ll already be out hunting for the next acquisition! Or let’s take the investment idea. Maybe you’re banking on your collection to make you wealthy, but the truth is that most items don’t increase in value. And even if the value does go up, the profits will probably be marginal and not even worth the space the collection requires. What should you do then? Well, if you still insist on being a collector, be a better one! Instead of accumulating large objects, try collecting smaller, but still meaningful, things. Consider objects like marbles, stamps, or baseball cards – even if your collection starts getting a bit out of hand, it’ll be hard for these small items to take over the whole house. Or consider the joy of bird watchers, who “collect” sightings of rare species, or of globetrotters, who’ve been to 30 countries. Remember, a collection doesn’t even have to consist of physical objects! Okay, maybe you’ve resolved to collect memories instead of shoes. That’s great! But there’s still the business of getting rid of all the excess that you’ve already accrued, so let’s explore some of the most common scaling-down strategies. One strategy is called grouping. It consists of grouping together all the duplicate items to get a grasp of what should stay and what should go. Do you have two, ten, or 20 umbrellas? In cases of such everyday objects, you might not even have been consciously collecting them. Rather, you may have added one here and another there as a precautionary extra, in case someone needed it in the future. Of course, in the process of scaling down, some items will inevitably have to go. Grouping is a good method because seeing all the similar items together will make it easier to see which ones are worth keeping. Skimming is a different approach with a similar effect: when skimming, you keep the best and throw out the rest without a second thought. For disposing of anything, from jackets to vases, skimming is a great strategy. Just get started by identifying anything that brings you only a moderate amount of use or satisfaction. Using this strategy, many objects might leave you wondering “what if” – and that’s actually a great sign that the item needs to go. Maybe your cupboards are stuffed with dishes, so you open them intending to throw out all but the best two sets. But then another voice inside your head says, “But what if I want to have that huge dinner party one day and serve all 50 people with real china?” Here, you need to counter that voice with another: “But am I ever going to have that party? And will they care if their food is on real china or not?” Answer: most likely not. Everyone is different, and different people will prefer different scaling-down methods. So, in addition to grouping and skimming, try out these two additional strategies to find the best fit for you. Performing triage means collecting all the items in question into one spot, then picking out three from the pile randomly. Out of those three, pick your least favorite. Once you do that, pick out another three random items, and again pick out your least favorite. In this way, you’ll easily cut down your belongings by one-third. Triaging is an especially great approach for collectors who have a lot of variations of one item, but it’s also applicable for smaller, everyday clutter, too. The final strategy is taking photographs of your beloved objects. It might sound trite, but photos will truly help you hold on to the special memories or meanings attached to objects without taking up much space at all. Of course, photos won’t have the same physicality as the actual item, but you might be surprised at how much satisfaction you can get from a two-dimensional reproduction. Much of the time, the value of an object lies in its ability to evoke the feelings or experiences attached to it. As we all know, photos can be invaluable when it comes to remembering that special dinner party or vacation with your loved ones – and the same is true for photos of your belongings. Maybe you don’t have any room left for your mother’s wedding dress or the vintage car that’s been sitting in your garage for years. It’s not easy to say goodbye, but photographs will help you remember and share the special stories behind such items, even when they’re gone. You’ve now successfully found a strategy that works for you and have culled the best from the rest. But the idea of trashing all your old belongings is still pretty distasteful, right? Well, the good news is that you don’t have to! Finding good homes for your stuff is actually an important part of scaling down in a happy, healthy way. Knowing that your objects will go to appreciative new owners instead of disappearing into the landfill will make the process much more bearable and even enjoyable. Finding the best match for one’s belongings might mean finding a specific person or donating them to the right charitable organization. Let’s take Jeff as a case study. Jeff needed to scale down, and so decided, rather reluctantly, to part with his beloved old car, which held many great memories. Naturally, he didn’t want to give it away randomly, so he found a reputable charity that would ensure someone else would benefit from it. Doing good while also decluttering his life was a double-whammy, in the best way possible. Recycling is another way to part with your things with a positive result for both you and society. Instead of throwing your things in the bin, try to salvage what parts can be recycled. Many communities have recycling programs for paper, metal, plastic and other materials. As the saying goes, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Knowing that your stuff will be reused will ease the process of scaling down since you’ll know someone will take advantage of it! The key message in this book: We don’t need a whole lot to be happy. Though it’s not easy to break the habit of over-consumption, finding ways to sort and reduce your stuff without sacrificing meaning and memories can help you live with less, and be happier for it.

How did you feel? Were these moments where you got your best work done, made your best purchasing decisions or did your best budgeting? Even though these stressful, pinched periods require us to be at our sharpest, the reality is that the perception of scarcity makes us even worse at dealing with these pressing problems. In fact, the coping mechanisms we draw upon during times of scarcity actually worsen our situation, further entrenching us in our predicament. Therefore, it’s vital to understand how and why we respond to scarcity in the way that we do, in order to develop proactive strategies to deal with it. After reading these blinks, you’ll discover why becoming distracted at your daughter’s softball game doesn’t make you a bad parent; why the wealthy are only sometimes interested in saving $50; and why firemen should wear seat belts. What do the tragedy of global poverty and the difficulties of sticking to yet another fad diet have in common? At first there doesn’t seem to be any link; in fact, they seem to be contradictory in every way. Yet upon closer inspection we discover that they are both consequences of the same malaise: scarcity. In fact, scarcity, defined as “having less than you feel you need,” is the link that connects many of the seemingly unrelated problems we face every day. This isn’t physical scarcity, as in the literal unavailability of objects, but rather the feeling of not having enough, whether it’s time, money, food or even something more abstract like education. Imagine a world-class chef who, having spent her entire life perfecting her craft, must create her best dish in less than two hours for a TV show, under intense time pressure. Here, time is scarce, and she doesn’t feel she has enough minutes for what she needs to do. The chef’s feeling of scarcity is essentially the same as that of the dieter who’s struggling to eat less than he’s accustomed to. To him, scarcity is the amount of calories he feels he’s missing from his meals. However, to a certain degree we can control our experience of scarcity by using something called a critical safety valve. For example, if you’ve overcommitted to work projects, your safety valve might mean missing a few deadlines. Or if you’re on a diet, you can take a break and have a slice of pizza. In this way, you are choosing how much scarcity you have to face. But not everything has a critical safety valve. If you’re poor, you can’t just decide to be rich for a day to alleviate the pressure. This lack of freedom to manipulate your situation means that poverty represents a particularly extreme form of scarcity. Regardless, the actual experience of scarcity is the same. When you’re hungry, food is all you can think about. This is because food – at that moment, even only for a few minutes – is scarce and the need to satiate your appetite is almost overwhelming. Even if we aren’t aware of it, when we experience scarcity of any kind, not just the kind regarding our biological needs, we become absorbed by it, obsessing over what we feel we lack. Toward the end of World War II, as the Allies advanced further into German-occupied territories, they faced the problem of bringing back concentration camp inmates from the edge of starvation. To solve this problem, the University of Minnesota conducted an experiment with 36 male subjects in which the subjects were first starved and then underwent various feeding regimens. The findings helped the camp survivors, and also revealed some fundamental insights. Not only did the subjects’ bodies physically weaken and their appetites sharpen, but their minds changed as well – they became obsessed with food. They compared food prices, obsessed over cookbooks, fantasized about switching careers and starting restaurants and were unable to follow film narratives, focusing instead only on the scenes with food in them. But scarcity does more than change the focus of our attention; it also changes how we interpret information. Consider, for instance, that when people undergo traumatic yet lightning-fast events, like robberies or car accidents, they often feel that the events lasted longer than they actually did, due to the huge amount of information that the brain had to process. Researchers call this phenomenon the subjective expansion of time. Scarcity is similar in that it can alter how we experience the world. Lonely people, for instance, are much better at judging others’ moods and emotions. This is because their lives center around observing others, trying to see in them what they themselves miss. Now that you know how scarcity works, the following blinks will examine how its effects play out in your daily life. As you look through your wallet, you stumble across a coupon with no expiration date for a free meal at a restaurant. This time, like every other time you see your coupon, you think: “Eh, I can use this any time. Not today, but maybe next week.” Consequently, it never gets used. This is actually quite common: coupons with no expiration date are less likely to be used than those that have one. But why? Essentially, we become more attentive and efficient at managing pressing needs, a process known as tunneling. When time is limited, you tend to get the most out of it, be it work or pleasure. This is what the authors call the focus dividend – the positive outcomes produced when scarcity captures the mind. Deadlines, for instance, aren’t just good for planning purposes, but also because they create scarcity (of time) and focus the mind. Take a study in which students were given essays to proofread with differing deadlines. Those who were assigned one essay per week over three weeks were more productive (in terms of meeting deadlines and finding typos) than those who were given three weeks to proofread the same three essays. Yet this intense focus on one thing comes at the expense of others, a phenomenon described by the authors as the tunnelling tax. You’ve surely experienced this, for example, when you’re so engrossed in a TV program that you can no longer hear your friend talking to you. But the consequences of the tunnelling tax aren’t always as trivial as hurting your friends’ feelings. In fact, they can be deadly. Take firefighters, who are so focused on reaching a fire – due to scarcity of time – that they neglect other considerations, like wearing seat belts. This is exactly what happened in the case of Brian Hunton, who died after he was flung out of the door of a fire engine racing to a fire. The deadline for your presentation is tomorrow. But your daughter has her city championship softball match tonight. Like a good parent, you go to her match, but you just can’t focus on the game, can’t enjoy yourself – your mind keeps wandering back to that presentation. Why can’t you just enjoy the moment? This is because scarcity taxes our bandwidth and, as a result, inhibits our most fundamental capacities, such as concentrating on that softball game. Bandwidth measures our computational capacity – namely, our ability to pay attention, make good decisions, stick to our plans, resist temptation, and so on. Scarcity uses up our bandwidth, which has a negative impact on many aspects of our behavior, such as our patience, tolerance, attention and dedication. A father who is preoccupied during his daughter’s softball match may seem a bad parent, and a student who can’t concentrate on his exam due to the stress of paying his tuition might seem incompetent or lazy, but these kinds of judgements are too shallow. Their lack of concentration isn’t a personal flaw, but merely a sign that their bandwidths are taxed by scarcity (of time or money in these cases). But why does scarcity tax our bandwidth in the first place? Basically, top-down attention, where the mind is directed by conscious effort to focus our attention, cannot prevent bottom-up intrusions, where our attention becomes captured by external stimuli. Scarcity is a bottom-up intrusion, and is therefore involuntary and powerful. For example, in a study of attention, dieters were asked to push a button when they saw a red dot appear on a screen. Interestingly, they were less likely to see the red dot if they had just seen a picture of food. Psychologists call this attentional blinking, because the picture of food (which created the feeling of scarcity) made them mentally “blink” as the dot appeared. How many times have you felt like you’re playing catch-up with your debts, only to find yourself in exactly the same hole as you were before? Scarcity is partly the result of an aspect of human behavior known as the scarcity trap. When we fall into the scarcity trap, two things happen: we constantly juggle, moving from one pressing task to the next, and yet are continually one step behind. Surely you’ve experienced this at school or work, when you have many things to do, pressing deadlines and the feeling that there’s too little time to get it all done. Instead of finishing your projects one at a time, you instead frantically jump from one to the other. As your deadline approaches, time becomes scarce for all the projects, causing you to juggle more and more. Being one step behind can also increase scarcity, as missed deadlines or delayed projects cause your new work to get a late start, and this can quickly spiral out of control. Although the scarcity trap is easy to succumb to, there is one way out: giving ourselves slack. Think of slack as the space in your vacation suitcase. If you pack your suitcase to the brim, then there will be no space to cram in the phone charger you forgot to include. The only way to get it in is to leave something else behind. However, if you intentionally leave a little space in the suitcase, then you’ll have the resources to deal with the unexpected. Slack might be something like free space in your schedule – a 15 minute window between meetings – which can save you the hassle of scarcity of time if your meeting overruns. Of course, not all situations allow for the creation of slack. Low-income earners, for example, simply don’t have the resources available to save money and create financial slack. Have you ever poured from an unusually shaped bottle, only to find there was far more liquid inside than you thought was possible? This is because your perception was wrong – if you were to do it again, however, you’d probably measure it more accurately. Indeed, expertise – learning from our experiences – can alter our perception. For instance, if a layperson were to pour you a shot of whiskey from each of four differently shaped bottles, you’d likely end up with four different-sized shots. However, an experienced bartender is far less likely to be influenced by the bottles’ shapes, thus making all four whiskey shots uniform. Likewise, the more we experience scarcity, the more we understand the value of each inch of space in our suitcases and each dollar in our bank accounts. If you’re an experienced traveller, then you know to stuff your socks and phone charger inside your shoes, uncoil your belt and slide it along the inside edge of the case, leave your umbrella at home, make trade-offs and leave frivolous things behind when you’re packing for your next big trip. In the same way, the pressing needs of the poor help them recognize the value of each dollar. We can see this in a study at a New Jersey train station in a wealthy town, where researchers surveyed commuters about how far they would go to get a deal. 54 percent would recommend traveling 45 minutes to save $50 on a $100 purchase, but interestingly, only 17 percent would do so for $50 savings on a $1,000 purchase. This is because the savings in the first case were proportionally much larger, and therefore more appealing to them. Conversely, 87 percent of visitors at a soup kitchen in Trenton, New Jersey, would pursue the discount on a $1,000 purchase and 76 percent for a $100 purchase. For them, experience had made them value every dollar, so it didn’t matter how much they were saving as long as they were saving something. How many times have you considered taking out a loan when your cash has run out? While you’re certainly not the only one to toy with the idea, it’s actually the most short-sighted thing you can do. Unfortunately, scarcity causes us to make rash decisions with little regard for their long-term consequences. When we’re intensely focused on putting food on the table, for instance, we’re less effective at planning for the future. Of course, planning in general is difficult for many, but scarcity makes the problem worse. For instance, when we’re busy, we easily ignore the future health costs of eating takeout in favor of satiating our hunger and overcoming the scarcity of time. Similarly, we’re less interested in the difficulties caused by debt in the future when we are tight on cash now. This shortsightedness, which the authors call the myopia of the poor, leads to suboptimal decisions, such as borrowing. We borrow for two reasons: an intense focus on the problem at hand as well as the fact that we cannot experience the future, only the present. Consider the case of Sandra, a former student at the Head Start child development program for low-income families. When times were tough she would use one loan to pay off another, causing her to pay $495 to $600 per month in fees, and be stuck in a position of perpetual debt. Her checks bounced, her car was repossessed and she ended up owing thousand of dollars in back taxes. But borrowing isn’t just about money. For instance, you can borrow time by putting off one project to make room for another. But this often results in “fees.” Putting off work increases the time it takes to do it, makes it harder to juggle your projects and can even lead to missed deadlines. Unfortunately, we often try to manage scarcity in ways that only exacerbate our problems. As you’ve seen, scarcity can be a real nuisance and can lead to terrible decisions and awful consequences. In our final blink, you’ll learn some ways to combat scarcity. Whether it’s improving the lives of the poor, managing scarcity in organizations or dealing with scarcity in everyday life, the strategy is always the same: change the programs, add in slack and reduce bandwidth. Whatever the area, you can always improve your program in a way that mitigates the effects of scarcity on everyone. Take university students, for example, who often have to manage the scarcity of time. They often miss classes because of deadlines they have for projects for other classes, but this could be solved with a simple restructuring of the classes themselves. Rather than having just one class, the university could schedule multiple modules starting at different times but running parallel to each other. Then, if someone misses one class, they can easily catch up in another. The availability of slack is equally important. Take Saint John's Regional Health Center in Missouri, which used to struggle with meeting deadlines for planned operations and consultations. Unexpected medical emergencies would require all the available rooms at the hospital, meaning they would have to push back their planned procedures. When an advisor examined this problem, he suggested a novel solution: always keep one room free. At first, the doctors thought this was crazy: “We already don’t have enough space, and now you want us to have less?!” In the end, however, it created slack, thus providing space for the emergencies and unplanned events, meaning that planned surgeries could now go ahead without fear of disruption. Finally, manage your bandwidth instead of the things that cause scarcity (time, money, etc.). When the authors first started working on this very book, they blocked out a period every morning to write, so that nothing would get in their way. But their time ended up being unproductive. Before their writing period, the authors would do other things, like look through and answer their emails. This small act stole their available bandwidth, meaning that their work period suffered. Time management is useless unless you protect your bandwidth! The key message in this book: Scarcity causes us to behave in all sorts of strange and self-defeating ways. We become so focused on solving our immediate problems that we lose sight of the future, not out of some kind of personal failure, but because scarcity actually alters the way we perceive the world itself. Actionable advice: Develop a system that requires you to confirm decisions before you commit to them.  If you want to buy a car because, for whatever reasons, you no longer have one, then you’ll want some way to prevent yourself from making rash, short-sighted decisions that could have far-reaching consequences (in this case, for your wallet or mobility). This system could be something as simple as not making the decision to buy your car when you’re on the lot. Suggested further reading: Nudge by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R.

As we’ll learn in the blinks ahead, it wasn’t just book-smarts that put humans on the moon; it was also the ability to find purpose in a task and remain prepared and well-rested for the unexpected challenges and fears that lay ahead. By learning from those who’ve achieved greatness, you’ll be in a better position to shoot for the moon and turn your wildest dreams into a reality. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a good night’s sleep can be the answer to your problems; why there’s a big difference between a December and a January deadline; and how a pen saved the Apollo 11 mission. July 20, 1969, is the date of a singular event in history, the day Apollo 11 landed safely on the moon. But it took decades of painstaking work filled with trials and tribulations to reach that goal. What kept the Apollo team motivated was a great sense of purpose. They held on to the dream that US ingenuity would be responsible for the first moon landing, and that this would promote the American values of freedom and democracy around the world. Such stakes are, of course, a big motivator. But having a strong sense of purpose doesn’t require rocket science. It can happen among any team, even one at a university call center. The University of Pennsylvania has a grant program to help qualified but financially-constrained students afford tuition. The program has a call center devoted to contacting alumni and asking them to donate. In 2007, psychologist Adam Grant had former beneficiaries of the program visit and speak to the team at the call center, to let them know in person just how much the money had changed their lives. Grant noted how this created an impressive motivating factor. With the staff now clear on the difference they were making, they had an increased sense of purpose which revealed itself as a 140 percent increase in the time spent working and a 171 percent increase in funds raised. Another proven way of boosting performance is to add a competitive element. And for the Apollo team, this aspect was certainly present. After all, the US was engaged in a riveting space race with the Soviet Union. Back in 1898, this motivating factor was studied by Norman Triplett, a psychology professor at Indiana University. When observing cyclists racing both with and without competitors, he noticed that the sportsmen consistently reached faster speeds when facing competition. In 2008, Triplett’s findings were expanded upon by Japanese psychologist Kou Murayama. He found that the motivating factor of competition increased even further when the individuals were part of a team, and team members were able to monitor their performance against their competitors’ performance. Then, in 2014, psychology professor Gavin Kilduff found that the motivating factor could be increased even further when the competitor is a personally-familiar rival. However, as we’ll see in the next blink, being competitive needs to be balanced against another important factor: knowing when to take it easy. It’s quite likely that the Apollo 11 moon landing would never have happened if it weren’t for one idea – that of the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. This is the breakthrough that made it possible for the astronauts to safely reach the surface by first having their main spacecraft orbit the moon closely. Once the main spacecraft was in orbit, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would use a small landing unit, named Eagle, to take them the final distance to the moon’s surface. This idea didn’t come out of a nonstop, 48-hour marathon brainstorming session. It came from months of deliberate tinkering with various possibilities and suggestions. Crucially, during this time there were also plenty of breaks for rest and periods when ideas could incubate and gradually come to fruition. Taking breaks and getting a good night’s sleep aren’t signs of laziness. In fact, they’re an essential part of generating innovative ideas. Creative minds such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are well-known for advocating the use of breaks and making time for energizing yet peaceful activities like long walks. Especially helpful are exercise breaks: In 2014, Stanford psychologist Marily Oppezzo found that people who walked on a treadmill during their break could increase creativity by up to 60 percent, compared to those who sat down. Importantly, Oppezzo found that this creativity boost could last several hours, long after the person resumed their seat. In other words, your work can benefit from hours of increased creativity after just a 30-minute walk. Similar benefits for innovative thinking come from getting restorative sleep. In 2004, psychologist Ulrich Wagner, from the University of Lübeck, gave participants a particularly tricky task involving a list of numbers where they had to replace some digits with other ones. Some participants were given this task in the morning, with no break for sleep, while others were given the task in the evening and could finish the next morning after a full night’s sleep. Now, the thing about this task was that it had a quick and innovative solution that wasn’t readily apparent to any of the participants. But what’s remarkable is that 60 percent of those who were able to return to the task after sleeping were able to deduce this innovative solution, while only 23 percent of the other participants were able to figure it out. It’s no wonder that many of the world’s leading companies, such as Google and Nike, are now encouraging their employees to take naps. So, the next time you have to solve a problem, you might try “sleeping on it,” as you may find a better solution in the morning. Most of the people on the Apollo 11 team didn’t come from privileged or well-to-do backgrounds. In fact, you could safely say that most of them had to overcome some form of adversity to reach their position on the team. This triumph over hardship had a beneficial effect since it instilled a belief that it is possible to achieve even the most ambitious of goals – such as blasting some astronauts into outer space and getting two of them to walk on the moon. A positive mind-set was a must among those on the Apollo 11 mission, as there was no shortage of challenges to overcome. So, no matter what you want to do in life, it’s important to maintain a positive outlook. This isn’t an outlook that will occur automatically – it must be cultivated. For this to happen, you should remember the times you performed well or accomplished something, whether it was a great test result or a successful project. Then, figure out what you did that led to this result and try to keep this positive result replaying in your mind as long as possible – as if it were a slow-motion replay during a sports telecast. To keep this mental replay going, it’s helpful to have some sort of visual cue, such as a card, photo or a memento from the event, placed somewhere you’re sure to see it every day, like on your bedside table. Over time, you’ll accumulate a variety of these positive events, and your positive outlook will naturally take root. Another useful tip for success is to have strong role models to look up to and keep as a living reminder that the extraordinary can be achieved. Your sense of optimism doesn’t have to come exclusively from your own experiences. There’s a rich history of other people who’ve accomplished amazing feats, and they should also serve as proof that the sky’s the limit for achievements. So find your own personal hero and keep them in mind when the going gets tough. Helen Keller is a good example: Born in 1888, Keller succumbed to an illness that took both her eyesight and hearing. Yet Keller learned how to communicate in other ways and eventually became the first deaf-blind person to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree. Keller also toured the United States and became a leading voice fighting for the rights of women and the poor, proving that even incredible adversity is no match for a strong will. If you had a bad math teacher early on, you may have struggled to learn and ended up with the idea that you’re no good at the subject. And if you were told that someone is a librarian, maybe you thought to yourself that they’re probably irrevocably introverted, right? Assumptions like these are common, but they’re also limiting and prejudicial. It’s better to have a mind-set that’s the opposite of limiting – the next quality of someone who shoots for the moon: a growth mind-set. When you have a growth mind-set, you don’t believe that anyone’s current situation is permanent. You believe that you and everyone else can change and improve and that a person’s abilities are not set in stone. Naturally, this is the kind of mind-set that encourages success. In the 1980s, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck coined the term growth mind-set as well as fixed mind-set, which describes the belief that someone’s abilities are set in stone. In 2007, Dweck proved the effect of these different mind-sets in a two-year study where she observed hundreds of high school students who were part of a difficult math program. At the beginning of the study, Dweck identified which students had a fixed mind-set and which had a growth mind-set. After a few months, it was apparent that the students with a growth mind-set were outperforming their fixed-minded peers, and this discrepancy only widened as the years went on. In looking at what exactly causes this discrepancy, Dweck saw that those with a growth mind-set had the ability to recover from failures. More precisely, she recognized that because the growth-minded students didn’t see their intelligence level as fixed, they weren’t afraid of failure. Instead, they knew they could learn from failure and use it to improve, so they were far more willing to take on challenging mathematical problems and learn from them. The fixed-minded students, on the other hand, worried that an incorrect solution to the problem would be a confirmation of the fixed notion that they were mediocre at math and would never get better. This made them reluctant to even try. One of the flight controllers on the Apollo 11 mission was Jerry Bostick, and he had some well-known words of wisdom: just because you can’t do everything you want to do, doesn’t mean you should give up and do nothing. Of course, Bostick’s words apply to everyone and not just rocket scientists, since he was essentially reminding people not to procrastinate by waiting for the perfect scenario that might never arrive. A good way to avoid procrastination is to take things one step at a time. Let’s say it’s the start of a new year and you’d like to lose ten pounds. Of course, this isn’t an easy goal, and if you dwell on all the potential difficulties, you may give up before you even start. But if you set a goal of losing at least one pound every month, it may start to appear a more achievable target. You may not lose all ten pounds by summertime, but six pounds would be better than nothing. And who knows, once you start getting results, you may feel so good that you start shedding the pounds even faster! Now, let’s say you want to launch a software startup while still keeping the steady paycheck of your current job. Your ideal vision might be to get up and running within a month, but when you realize that this would require you to work nonstop for every waking hour of four full weeks, you may give up before a single line of code is written. However, if you show some flexibility and just stick to working on the weekends, there’s a good chance you’ll be launching sooner than you think. Another helpful method for avoiding procrastination is to set smart deadlines. That’s right; some deadlines are cleverer than others. In a 2014 study, economist Yanping Tu, of Florida University, gave participants a six-month deadline to open a bank account. One group had the six months between June and December, while the other group had the six months between July and January of the following year. Oddly enough, since the January deadline was in the following year, this group procrastinated more because they felt they had more time than they actually did. So, a smart deadline will take this into account and prevent needless procrastination by avoiding dates that spill over into the following year, month or even week. Gerry Griffin was the lead flight director for the Apollo 12 mission, which was a notable mission for many reasons, not least that the rocket was struck by lightning moments after it took off on the afternoon of November 14, 1969. This unexpected development put Griffin in a tough spot because he was in charge of deciding whether the mission should proceed as planned or whether he should pull the plug before things got worse. The data visible in the control room was garbled due to the strike. Fortunately, the ground crew were still able to communicate with the astronauts and get them to flip a switch on their end that allowed the ship’s data to get back online. With this fix in place, mission control could now at least monitor the rocket. Obviously, a great deal of time, money and effort had gone into getting Apollo 12 prepared and launched, so pulling the plug would have felt like a tremendous waste. But then again, as one of Griffin’s trusted colleagues reminded him at that key moment, this time, there was no great need for them to land on the moon. So Griffin did what he was supposed to do, and after checking that everything was looking good, he decided that the mission could safely proceed as planned. This proved to be the right decision, as Apollo 12 gave NASA their second moon landing, and the astronauts returned safely to earth ten days later. Similarly, sometimes making decisions about your future requires you to acknowledge your fears. Fortunately, there are ways to practice and get better at this difficult fact of life. The more you do something, the easier it will get. Therefore, the more you do uncomfortable or scary things, the braver you’ll begin to feel as these things become less frightening. While you should never do anything reckless, routinely confronting your fears will make you better at responding well to a crisis. This is a good opportunity to consider what you feel frightened of – perhaps it’s public speaking, swimming, or talking to strangers at a party? So maybe it’s time to take a swimming class or volunteer to give a big presentation at work. When you emerge safe and sound from these experiences, you’ll find yourself becoming braver and more competent at making decisions, even in a crisis. While Apollo 11 is famous for its successful outcome, that doesn’t mean there weren’t any hiccups along the way. One memorable issue arose on July 20, 1969, as Eagle, the lunar module carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, was approaching the moon’s surface. It was, of course, a major moment in the mission. And it was just as the approach was underway that the control room received the first of many alerts, with the code number 1202 popping up. What was happening? Were Neil and Buzz in danger? In moments like these, it pays to be well-prepared, which mission leader Jack Garman certainly was. He had a sheet with all alert codes within reach, so he could quickly confirm that 1202 meant the Eagle’s computer was experiencing an overload. After all, it was attempting to calculate the remaining distance to the moon as well as the movements of the main shuttle as it continued to orbit the moon, and send information to the control room on earth. For a computer in 1969, that was asking a lot, and so now it was sending the alert, saving as much data as possible and restarting. Being prepared, Garman didn’t panic. He knew that the computer malfunction was temporary and wouldn’t interfere with the landing. So the mission proceeded as planned, and Neil Armstrong got to say his famous words, “The Eagle has landed.” To show grace under pressure and be as well-prepared as the Apollo 11 team, it’s wise to identify potential problems before launching your next big project. As a psychologist and decision-making specialist, Gary Klein has developed what he calls a pre-mortem, which is a way to prepare for high-pressure situations by imagining everything going wrong each step of the way. Then, at every step, you can examine the reasons behind each failure. Let’s say you’re organizing a fundraiser. One of the first problems may be that no one shows up! So why would that happen? Maybe the invites had the wrong date? Or maybe the directions to the venue were confusing? When you make a pre-mortem you can systematically go through all these potential pitfalls and make sure that you’ve done everything you can to prevent them from happening or quickly and calmly deal with them if they do arise. The computer overload alert wasn’t the only problem to arise when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about to touch down in their Eagle lunar module. As the Eagle was landing, one of the astronauts accidentally broke the button they would need to ignite the ascent engine of the lunar module and get them back to the orbiting spacecraft that would take them back home. Obviously, this was no small issue. Fortunately, Aldrin was quite adaptable and pretty good at thinking on his feet to find clever solutions. In this case, he thought of using the trusty felt-tip pen he kept in his pocket for jotting down notes. He knew the plastic pen wouldn’t conduct electricity, and it was just the right size to fit the opening where the button had broken off and activate the ignition. Sure enough, it did just that. So it’s not too much of a stretch to say that Buzz Aldrin’s pen, as well as his adaptability, saved them from being stranded on the moon. It also goes to show that even if you believe you’ve covered every possible pitfall, life will probably find a way to throw something unexpected your way. In fact, with any major project, it’s better to plan for something unexpected to happen because your success could very well depend on how you adapt and react – just as the success of Apollo 11 eventually depended on the resourcefulness of those astronauts. On the bright side, it turns out that being adaptable not only prevents failure, but it also has the added bonus of promoting happiness. In 2003, the British psychologist and management expert, Frank Bond, conducted a study where 400 employees were given questionnaires to find out how adaptable and flexible they were. They were asked how they responded to challenges at work, specifically whether they came up with multiple solutions or just tried to make one solution work each time. In the end, the study found that the more adaptable employees were not only more productive; they also reported being happier than their less adaptable peers. The men and women of the Apollo missions proved that it is possible to make the seemingly impossible a reality. And in doing so, they showed the world how anyone can make their dreams come true. With some focused effort, you can stay motivated, creative and courageous to take on the challenges life brings and not be afraid to dream big and shoot for the moon. The key message in these blinks: Nothing is out of reach, and you too can achieve the seemingly impossible by learning from the Apollo teams that made the lunar missions a reality. Achieving great things is neither a miracle nor just a matter of luck. To attain your goals, try to find a deeper purpose to your work, take sufficient breaks, sleep on problems, work on your courage and prepare for everything, even the unexpected. Actionable advice: Create your own competition to boost your motivation.  Competing is a great way to boost performance and motivation. So if you’re having trouble achieving some of your goals, see if you can’t make a competition out of it. For example, if you want to lose weight, you could turn it into a competition with your partner, to see who can lose the most. Or if you lack motivation at the gym, imagine that you’re competing with somebody you consider a rival. Your performance might just soar! Got feedback?

But when it comes to the dramatic international tension of the Space Race between the USSR and the United States, the most pivotal NASA mission was Apollo 8. Rocket Men takes you behind the scenes of this risky mission and explains why it was such a make-or-break endeavor for the US space program. While Apollo 11 serves as the dramatic climax to the Space Race, Rocket Men puts you right in the middle of the running, when victory was still very much up for grabs.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

You wake up with a splitting headache after a big night on the town and say, “I’m never drinking again.” Or maybe you’ve stepped on a scale for the first time in months, only to see a number so horrifying that you resolve to finally “get in shape.” But how many times have you actually followed through? Like so many of us, you’d probably be embarrassed to even say. In fact, most of us don’t stick to our resolutions. As a result, we end up keeping bad habits that we know we want and need to change. These blinks will show you exactly why we have such a hard time keeping promises to ourselves and what we can do to change it. And not only that, you’ll learn how making a change, if you can formulate your goals in a way that actually makes sense, is in fact quite easy. In these blinks, you’ll learn: why most of our resolutions are really just “wannabe” resolutions; how to use your love for food as a way to lose weight; and how to keep yourself from “falling off the wagon” and sticking to your promises. Alongside sipping Champagne and counting down the seconds until midnight, one of the highlights of New Year’s Eve is sharing your resolutions with trusted friends, swearing to lose 10 pounds or quit smoking. You always say that this year – unlike last year – you’ll do it. Yet inevitably you fail, year after year. In fact, some estimates say that people fail in keeping some 88 percent of the resolutions they make. But why is this the case? In part, you fail because your resolutions are simply too overreaching. On New Year’s Eve, for example, it’s easy to feel guilty about having spent the past holiday week lazing around and overeating. To make up for the gluttony, you vow to make huge, sweeping changes. However, these changes are usually too broad, and therefore too easy to let slip. Say one of your promises was to “get in shape and go to the gym.” This resolution is too broad, and leaves you with too many unanswered questions. When do you plan to go? How will you determine when you’re sufficiently “in shape?” Broad, imprecise resolutions such as these will most likely lead you to slacking altogether, with excuses like: “I’ll skip the gym today and go tomorrow instead.” Sometimes resolutions fail because you want things to happen without having a concrete idea of how to achieve them. These are wannabe resolutions, and are little more than commandments to make you a better person, rather than an actual change. For example, if you’ve ever told yourself that you “want to be more organized,” then you’ve uttered a wannabe resolution. Sure, you may want this, but how do you achieve it? There’s nothing built into your resolution that offers you a place to start – and if starting is difficult, then it’s unlikely that you’ll continue and reach your goal. When you fail to keep a resolution, it’s easy to berate yourself for having poor self-control. However, this is far too simplistic. The real reason why we fail is that our habits and routines – the things we do without thinking – govern much of our behavior. In short: we spend a lot of our time on autopilot. When you drive to work, it is your autopilot mode that makes you to stop at red lights without thinking, “I see a red light, therefore, I need to brake.” Running on autopilot helps us to save mental energy for the more important work that requires your undivided attention. Yet it is also responsible for our bad habits. Autopilot also makes us visit the vending machine at work to buy a pack of salty pork rinds without thinking whether we’re even hungry. Our autopilot habits are very powerful and very resistant to change. Consequently, this makes the bad habits hard to break. In fact, the only way to end a bad habit is to cultivate the opposite of autopilot – being fully aware of your actions, or mindfulness. In contrast to autopilot, mindfulness requires a great deal of mental energy and willpower. But willpower is a scarce resource. In trying to break bad habits, you can easily exhaust your willpower and then relapse into the old routines you so wanted to change. Only in very rare situations, such as after receiving bad health news or during a messy breakup, can you develop enough willpower and energy to make a fundamental change in your behavior. Absent serious environmental factors, though, you may have to resort to other instruments. To break the cycle and take steps toward self-improvement, declare war on your autopilot. The following blinks will give you the best weapons to do just that. So what should you do to change your bad habits? Make microresolutions. Microresolutions take your broad and unmanageable resolutions, chop them up and turn them into precise and practical plans that you can quickly achieve. Rather than forcing you to tackle a large problem all at once, microresolutions instead aim to make one or two small, tangible changes in your life or daily habits. Microresolutions are always explicit; they are concrete orders that you can follow. Consequently, your microresolution must always focus on a specific change in behavior, and not a result that can be achieved in a number of different ways. For example, if you want to live healthier and lose weight, your resolution might be to “just eat less.” Yet this goal is unspecific and hard to put into a concrete plan of action. Let’s transform it into a microresolution! Say you have a bad habit of snacking on too many cookies at your daily planning meeting at work. This is a great place to make an easy change! By forcing yourself to not grab a cookie, you’ll cut some 350 calories a day from your diet. Plus, unlike the broad goal of “eating less,” this step is easy to measure and to achieve. And how easy is it to say “no” to one cookie per day? The idea behind microresolutions is that they are so easy and achievable that it would be absurd not to keep them. With your cookie resolution, there are no loopholes or possible excuses. You just don’t eat the cookie. What’s more, your microresolution gives you instant gratification – you can see the results immediately, not in the distant future. Although you can easily keep a microresolution, it may take some time for your brain to permanently adjust to following new habits. Early on, it’s not unusual to feel confused or annoyed as you struggle to keep your new habits. After a few weeks, however, your resistance to these changes will start to dwindle. You’ll see new, healthier habits forming as your changes becomes incorporated into your autopilot. And once it’s there, it will stick. Say you plan to walk to work instead of taking the bus to become more fit. During the first days and weeks, you’ll probably struggle – the walk is long and boring, and it takes too long! However, with time you’ll eventually just do it without a second thought. The annoyance will fade and the benefits will be evident, as your health will gradually improve. As you start to make positive behavioral changes, you might be tempted to overload with more and more microresolutions. Don’t do it! Ease into the process and give yourself a chance to adapt. Consider your microresolution to walk to work. Perhaps it’s not best to immediately start walking to work every day, since that’s a huge commitment. You could instead start by walking every Monday. That’s a far more achievable first step, and offers you room to improve. Resist the impulse to implement hundreds of new microresolutions, and instead limit yourself to one or two at a time. By doing so, you ensure that you have the concentration and endurance to undergo a complete behavioral shift. Only once you’ve made your new habits part of your autopilot can you start to build on top of them with more microresolutions. You are unique, with your own desires and needs. Consequently, there is no universal master list of microresolutions from which you can choose to change your behavior for the better. Microresolutions are also unique. They correspond to your individual needs and to your mind-set, and should be framed in a way that makes it easy for you to follow them. However, there are some rules that you should follow. When you are crafting a microresolution, use positive framing. That is, create a resolution that is positive, and not merely a command. This way, you’ll be motivated to actually follow through. Perhaps you have a bad habit of eating far too quickly. Having finished your meal before everyone else, you’re often tempted to go back for seconds, causing you to put on extra pounds. To break this habit, you might consider a microresolution like: “Chew your food slowly.” This command isn’t very exciting or motivating, and therefore it will be harder to stick to. But you could easily come up with a more positive microresolution. How about: “I will savor my food and drink.” Here, you are giving yourself permission to enjoy your meal, a pleasurable activity. This way, it’s much easier to follow through on your microresolution. However, while positive framing is ideal, you might have to take an opposite approach and use zero-tolerance framing. This is best for resisting specific traps that lead to bad habits. For example, if you “quickly” check your email at 11 p.m. on the way to bed, but once hypnotized by the screen, stay glued to your computer until 1 a.m., you’ll suffer from a lack of sleep and wasted time. Here, a zero-tolerance resolution is needed to eliminate the bad habit that causes sleeplessness. For example: “Zero tolerance for using the computer after 10 p.m.” Have you heard of Pavlov’s dogs? Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov conducted an experiment in which he rang a bell whenever it was time for his dogs to eat. Gradually, the dogs connected the bell with meal times, so when the bell rang, they began to salivate – even if there was no food in front of them. We are programmed in much the same way – hearing, smelling or seeing certain cues can cause our bodies to react in certain ways. Often, this can lead to unhealthy habits. After a hard workout, for example, you pass by a vending machine at the gym. You’re hungry, so you buy a snack. The next day, you do the same. And again the next. Soon, the mere sight of the vending machine will prompt you to buy a snack, even if you aren’t actually hungry. While these impulses can clearly create bad habits, you can also use them to make following your microresolutions easier. To do this, you’ll need to find a cue that you can use as an anchor for your microresolution. One useful cue is using a specific time. For example, if you want to walk to work in the mornings, you can anchor it to specific day, such as: “Every Friday morning I will walk to work.” Your microresolution will be triggered after you’ve had your breakfast, look at your calendar and notice that it’s Friday! It can be challenging, however, to find the right cue. In this case, you can piggyback your microresolution onto another, more established habit. If you’ve resolved to floss, but keep forgetting to do it, you can piggyback flossing with your evening habit of brushing your teeth. Then, you can’t help but remember to floss whenever you brush. So now you know the ground rules for microresolutions. In the following blinks, we’ll see how microresolutions work in action. We all need to sleep, yet we sleep far too little. Even though science has shown that sleep deprivation wears us down and fogs our thinking, some 75 percent of American adults still sleep less than six hours per night. Most of us desperately need to find ways to get more sleep. Luckily, microresolutions can help! You can start by examining the habits that cause you to stay up late. Often, we consider the time after work and chores as our “time off.” Because of this, you might not feel like going to bed immediately, even when your body feels like cement and you know full well that tomorrow will be exhausting. This practice can result in bad habits. For example, after a stressful day, all you might want to do is relax and zone out by watching TV. Instead, you fall asleep on the couch; but then get up again later to brush your teeth, floss, charge your phone and so on. After finishing your nighttime routine, you finally make it to bed only to lie awake, no longer sleepy. After examining your routines that keep you from getting a good night’s sleep, you can then design a suitable and easy-to-keep microresolution. If you know that watching TV will make you sleepy, you can use this information to piggyback a microresolution on to another cue or habit. You could, for example, make sure you get ready for bed as soon as you’ve put your child to bed. In this way, if you get sleepy on the couch, you can go to bed immediately, having already completed your nighttime routine. With enough repetition, this resolution will become part of your autopilot and you’ll do it without a second thought – and improve your sleeping habits for good. Who hasn’t made a resolution to “get fit” and then almost immediately broken it? Getting in shape is one of the most difficult resolutions to keep. Our hunting-and-gathering ancestors never had to worry about slimming down. But our modern lives are far less active: we sit at a desk all day, slouch on the couch all evening, then lay in bed all night. Scientific studies have shown just how unhealthy this sedentary lifestyle is. Sitting all day doesn’t burn calories so we gain weight; and it’s been found that sitting all day actually shortens our life span. The good news, however, is that it doesn’t take much to lower the risks of inactivity. All we have to do is make tiny changes to become more active and lower the risks to our health. Indeed, even small amounts of activity can make a difference in terms of overall health and body weight, as moving around just a bit can help you maintain healthy blood sugar and insulin levels, critical to preventing diabetes and heart disease. So, you don’t have to rush to the gym or run a 5K every day to extend your life span. That’s a good thing too, since we know that these all-or-nothing resolutions rarely work out. Knowing that even small changes can do wonders for your body and mind, microresolutions seem like the perfect way to improve your health, no? For example, you could resolve to “climb six flights of stairs every workday after lunch.” By anchoring your microresolution to the moment you get up from the lunch table, you have an easy way to start building a positive habit. Once established, you will always remember to take the stairs after lunch, thus sticking to your resolution and leading a healthier life. As you can see, small changes can make a huge difference. As you make your microresolutions, you will become inspired to build upon them, leading to a steady and satisfying path to self-improvement. The key message in this book: The big changes we want to make in our lives often fail precisely because they are so big. Instead, we should aim to make small, measurable changes – microresolutions – to put ourselves on the path to improvement. Suggested further reading: Switch by Chip and Dan Heath Switch examines why it is difficult for people to switch their behaviors, and how, by understanding our minds, it is possible to find shortcuts that make change easier. Through examples from scientific studies and anecdotes, Switch provides simple yet effective tools for implementing change.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

How exactly: by reading more; picking up a new instrument? Well, there’s good news and bad news. The good news is that many scientists believe your efforts to improve your intelligence will pay off. The bad news is that maybe they won’t. As these blinks explain, intelligence is unlike a muscle in many ways; you can’t lift weights to grow your intelligence. And what improves our intelligence is confounding, tricky to measure precisely. But certain techniques have proven to increase intelligence, as these blinks will show you. These blinks will also take a closer look at the most contemporary understandings of intelligence. After reading this pack, you’ll know why some scientists think intelligence can’t be increased; why resistance training makes you smarter; and why the military has invested in an intelligence project! It’s a little like love: We all know about it, but where is it? What is it? Among the seemingly endless questions, we’re starting to make some headway in understanding intelligence. Psychology research has proposed two general categories of intelligence. In 1971, psychologist Raymond Cattell coined the terms fluid and crystallized intelligence, differentiating between the two ways we think. Fluid intelligence is our ability to think logically, and solve novel problems. This type of thinking underpins the act of reasoning. It allows us to see patterns, and solve things that we haven’t been taught explicitly. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is the storehouse of information or how-to knowledge that we accumulate throughout our lives. Crystallized intelligence helps us with many things, from answering those general knowledge questions at pub quizzes, to ensuring we remember how to ride a bicycle. While our crystallized intelligence is constantly growing, scientists agreed that fluid intelligence was unchangeable. Up until now. It was understood that fluid intelligence reached its peak in early adulthood, around the time you might go to university. A peak at that age explains why most of the influential work done by mathematicians, musicians and physicists occurs in their twenties, and rapidly slows after that. Moreover, fluid intelligence is closely linked to how our brains are physically structured. So, just as we’d never be able to go to the gym to train our eyes to change from brown to blue, we can’t memorize numbers and then solve equations we’ve never seen before! Or can we? New evidence suggests we can. To find out, we need to overcome one sizeable hurdle: how can we measure fluid intelligence in the first place? The next blink covers the methods that work. What’s the true measure of intelligence? IQ tests? Brain scans? Both are contenders. Measuring fluid intelligence is challenging because there’s no way to directly observe it. That’s why psychologists call it a construct: a conceptual idea that we can’t directly observe but nevertheless can attempt to measure. Dark matter is another example of a construct: physicists use complex equations to measure it but they’ve never actually seen it. Traditional intelligence or IQ tests run by psychologists use latent variable analysis, whereby multiple indirect measurements are analyzed in conjunction with each other; the degree to which the measurements sync up indicates the IQ test results. In this manner, you’d ask multiple questions about mathematics, for example, and then analyze the correlations among how the test-taker answered. While IQ tests provide some indication of intelligence, it’s an uncertain measurement. Brain scans, on the other hand, might provide more direct measurements. A technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help us observe fluid intelligence in action. fMRI measures brain activity by showing blood flow to regions of the brain. More blood flow equates to more activity. More activity means more neuronal firing, which would mean a greater amount of brain matter working on a problem. This, in a very simple manner, is related to intelligence. But how? Studies show that 6.7 percent of fluid intelligence is determined by the amount of neurons, or gray matter, in the brain. A further 5 percent is reflected in the size of the left lateral prefrontal cortex. fMRI shows this area to be highly active during tests of working memory. Working memory is the way in which we manipulate what we’re asked to remember, as distinct from short term memory. While short term memory has little to do with intelligence, working memory is the process that new brain games aim to improve. The next blink explains how and why brain games target the working memory.  Imagine if all you had to do to become smarter was play a quirky little game, like Angry Birds – an appealing prospect! It’s not entirely out of reach either. In fact that’s exactly what Lumosity offers. Lumosity was co-founded by Michael Scanlon in 2007 during his neuroscience doctorate at Stanford. By April, 2013, it had already grown to a massive 40 million members. By turning psychologist-designed cognitive tasks into fun and engrossing computer games, Lumosity became a huge success. One of these games is called N-Back, and it’s designed to target your working memory. The N refers to the number of places back you have to remember when items in a sequence match. So the sequence “A B C C A” is a 1-back task, as you only have to remember one place back to the last time you saw the C. In a 2-back task, you’d have to remember the letters at least two back from what you’re up to in the sequence to see if there is a match. So in a sequence of “H J K J S H S”, for example, you would have to hit the button on the letters that have been italicized, as these are the letters that match another letter two places back in the series. The game gets more difficult when the task becomes 3-back, 4-back and so on. Can a simple task like the N-Back game really improve our working memory? Many said no, until psychologist Susanne Jaeggi shattered expectations in 2008 by showing that the N-Back tasks, after a mere four weeks, increased participants’ scores on fluid intelligence tests by 40 percent. Similar training games have also improved the attention spans of children suffering from ADHD.   But, these tasks aren’t the only proven approaches for improving cognitive ability. The next blink shows how you can make yourself smarter, not just in front of the computer screen, but by getting your body moving! Don’t feel like spending much more time at your computer? Never fear: There are ways to improve your intelligence that don’t involve staring at a computer screen. As far back as the 1960s, research has suggested that physical fitness influences cognitive performance. In one study, elderly people who played tennis showed significantly better results on a variety of cognitive tests than those who didn’t exercise. Current research looks at what type of exercise yields the biggest gains in intelligence. Typically, these contemporary studies investigate aerobic exercise, such as running or swimming, and resistance exercise, such as weight-lifting. Interestingly, a study conducted by Teresa Liu-Ambrose in 2012 found marked differences in the cognitive impacts of different kinds of exercise.   In Liu-Ambrose’s study, 86 women were randomly assigned to groups of either toning, aerobic or resistance training for six months. At the end of the study, only the resistance group showed improvements on traditional cognitive tests of attention and memory, as well as increased activity in fMRI tests.   Another active area in cognitive research is the link between learning music and fluid intelligence. In 2004, psychologist Glenn Schellenberg, a leader in the field, published a paper called “Music lessons enhance IQ,” which has been cited in over 363 papers to date. The study compared voice lessons, keyboard lessons, acting lessons and no lessons at all among young children who were randomly assigned to each group for a year. After 36 weeks all the groups showed improved IQ scores, which is to be expected after beginning elementary school. However, the students trained in voice showed the greatest improvements, followed by the children who had keyboard lessons, then drama and then no lessons. Despite the positive evidence, some scientists are still skeptical of our capacity to improve our own fluid intelligence. But one group in particular continues to invest in cognitive training. Read our final blink to find out which. Why can’t scientists agree about whether or not you can improve your intelligence? And if evidence is so inconclusive, why’s the military so interested? A meta-analysis into research on brain training and intelligence has cast doubt on whether intelligence can really improve. A meta-analysis uses various statistical techniques to make sense of differing results across studies. Patterns across studies allow for greater clarity among conflicting research. Charles Hulme and Monica Melby-Lervåg published a meta-analysis of 23 studies on improving working memory through brain training. This study wanted to see if far transfer could be found from brain training games such as the N-Back task. Far transfer is when gains on one task are also seen on a task that is not directly related. For example, verbal working memory training improves non-verbal reasoning, such as problem solving. The results showed that there was transfer of improvement, with 22 of the studies showing small but reliable transfer from working memory to non-verbal reasoning. However, the researchers concluded that just because improvements on working memory tasks were also seen on dissimilar non-verbal reasoning tasks, that doesn’t mean it will improve real-world performance in reading or math. Nevertheless, the US military is one group that definitely sees the value in brain-training. Federal agencies in the United states have been so impressed by brain training studies that, in January, 2014, a $12-million program was initiated by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). IARPA is run by the US Director of National Intelligence. The program plans to use a variety of brain-training techniques to improve the cognitive abilities of their intelligence analysts. Key message in this book: Research shows we can improve our intelligence using brain games, but it’s unclear to what extent and how exactly. Research also shows that traditional methods like learning an instrument continue to have positive results, as well. Actionable advice: Keep it natural!  Magic smart pills such as ritalin do not increase intelligence and impair one’s natural ability to improve the brain’s capacity. Avoid them as much as possible. Claims that natural supplements such as Omega-3 oil and B vitamins improve cognitive ability are also unproven. If they work, you may be experiencing the placebo effect.

Yet our society is overly concerned that persistent worrying will damage our health or keep us from fulfilling our true potential. As a result, we feel obliged to be cheery and optimistic. “Lighten up!” your friends might say. But why did we as a society become so obsessed with positivity? How did we come to believe that everyone can achieve (almost) anything? Are we really better off in the pursuit of happiness? These blinks help shed light on America’s obsession with positive thinking and the negative aspects of always trying to “be happy.” In these blinks, you’ll also learn how positive thinking played into the hands of the 9/11 terrorists; why a bestselling author says that negative thinking causes tsunamis; and why human evolution favors pessimists.   Let’s say God has already determined whether you’re going to heaven or hell, and there’s nothing you can do to about it. If you look deep within yourself, or catch yourself thinking sinful thoughts or acting lazily, you’ll just confirm what you already knew: that you’re doomed. That’s what early European settlers to America, adherents to Calvinism, believed. Calvinism is a strict, frugal form of Protestantism that stresses the importance of labor and frowns upon leisure, frivolity and excess. Reacting to their religion’s extremist beliefs, many children raised in Calvinist households eventually rebel, preferring a less forbidding God and developing new, more accepting spiritual attitudes. Take Mary Baker Eddy, for example. The daughter of strict Calvinists, her spiritual writings helped shaped the New Thought school in nineteenth-century America. New Thought was a philosophical movement that taught that God’s loving spirit lives within all people. Believers felt that anyone could overcome suffering, even physical illness, by thinking “divine” or positive thoughts. This marked the beginning of what we now call positive thinking, or the idea that every person is in charge of his or her fate. This mind-set went on to transform America into a place of boundless optimism and opportunity. Just like Calvinism, New Thought stressed self-analysis, but through a different lens. Positive thinking encourages a person to believe that things can always get better, an assumption that makes one think she can influence fate. In other words, such an ideology promotes the idea that anyone can do anything as long as they try hard enough. Since then, a cult of positive thinking has spread and grown to become a national ideology: the idea that every American has the opportunity to succeed. But there’s a major problem with such logic. If people believe that it’s up to them to change fate, then they’ll hold themselves accountable for everything that happens to them. And that’s precisely what has happened in America. Positive thinking today has become a prominent ideology in American culture at large, touching everything from people’s personal lives to the workplace. It has even taken hold in places of worship. Many churches in America today have stopped preaching about the weight of sin, guilt and suffering, telling congregations instead that God wants Christians to maintain a positive attitude. What’s more, these churches hold that God will directly help believers succeed and get rich, too. Naturally, churches that spread the “prosperity gospel” attract plenty of followers. For instance, in a 2006 Time magazine survey, some 17 percent of American Christians were found to adhere to a “prosperity gospel,” and a whopping 61 percent agreed with the statement, “God wants people to prosper.” The number of “mega” churches – places of worship with a weekly attendance of at least 2,000 people – has grown to 1,210 in America alone, and many promote a prosperity gospel. One effect of this positive ideology is rising expectations. In its extreme form, positive thinking claims that personal beliefs determine everything that happens to a person; if one is accountable in one’s life, one can assume that good things will follow. After all, if a person can shape the future by simply thinking about what he wants, human potential suddenly is not limited by the confines of a person’s actions. Along these lines, becoming a world-class musician just requires the appropriate mind-set – not unique talent or years of practice.   Yet the assumption that a person can control his life through the power of thought has produced expectations that are exceedingly difficult to meet. For example, it set the stage for “get rich quick” books and schemes because, once people decided that their success was up to them, spiritual enlightenment wasn’t enough. They expected to make a fortune, too, through a commitment to positive thinking. Let’s say your friend, an intelligent, hardworking and driven black man, has been passed over for promotion for the fifth year running. What advice do you offer him? Would you tell him to file a discrimination complaint with human resources, or seek motivational coaching? For businesses, the latter option is the preferred route. In fact, motivational coaching based on positive thinking has become popular in the business world because of the benefits it affords employers. Motivational coaching holds people personally accountable for their successes and work satisfaction. As a result, employees learn to blame themselves – instead of employers – for any discontent they may feel at work. This is true even of employees made to work under poor conditions – whether they’re forced to accept low pay, face discrimination daily or suffer under an insurmountable workload. Motivational coaching also aims to boost employee morale, encouraging workers to do better and more, boosting the bottom line for employers and, occasionally, rewarding employees too. To keep employees performing and generating profits for the company, motivational coaches have workers design dream boards. These collages use pictures and words to represent the things that an employee wants. The board is then put on a worker’s desk to serve as a reminder that working hard will help the employee reach his goals. Another reason businesses promote positive thinking is that it helps to assuage the concerns of employees over job security. By telling themselves everything will be “fine,” employees can remain focused on work and not looming layoffs. As a result, positive thinking itself has turned into big business. Clearly, a motivated workforce is key to a corporation’s growth and prosperity, no matter if the workers are deluded. Positive thinking books, conferences, coaching programs and motivational speakers have coalesced into a thriving industry. In 2007, coaches preaching the positivity doctrine earned $1.5 billion globally. Before advances in science, many people believed in magic, witch doctors and other spirits to keep a body healthy. Today, of course, modern society is far more rational. Or is it? Many health experts even today claim that positive thinking is good for your health. Yet such arguments are seriously flawed. If a person maintains a positive outlook on life, supporters claim, he’ll avoid even potentially overcome illness. Stress hormones reduce the body's natural defenses; thus, the thinking goes, if you remain positive, your body’s immune response is strengthened. In his book Love, Medicine and Miracles, surgeon Bernie Siegel detailed how greater self-acceptance can boost a person’s immune system, helping it fight cancer. He also argues that cancer might be a “blessing,” as it can help patients adopt a more loving attitude toward the world and themselves. There are plenty of reasons to mistrust such claims. Cancer researcher Penelope Schonfield in 2004 found that lung cancer patients who remained optimistic during their treatment had the same survival rates as those who maintained a more gloomy attitude. Another study published in 2007 by psychologist James Coyne and his coauthors examined the relationship between psychotherapy – which can improve a person’s mood, reduce stress and help develop a positive outlook – and survival rates in cancer patients. The study found that, of all the experiments claiming that psychotherapy increases survival rates, not one held up under scrutiny. This was in large part due to the studies’ flawed methods. Many were done with too few patients to be reliable and, in one study, patients in the psychotherapy group received medical care of a much higher quality. While the “cult” of positive thinking has its issues, is it so bad to remain optimistic? Mainstream culture shuns skeptics and pessimists; nobody wants to be a “downer.” But by insisting that everything will be fine because we believe it will, we’re denying reality. Bad things happen to everyone – disregarding that fact won’t offer you any real protection. Nevertheless, proponents of positive thinking remain persistent. Rhonda Byrne, author of the bestselling self-help book The Secret, said that people killed and displaced by the 2006 tsunami in Indonesia must have “manifested it” – that is, brought it upon themselves – through their negative thinking. Blaming victims isn’t the only problem with this ideology. Blindly thinking positive also causes people to deny signs of danger by insisting that things are always good or improving. Any rational person knows it’s dangerous to deny that real threats exist. As a species, we’ve survived as long as we have because instinct tells us to keep an eye out for danger, and not bask in moments of bliss. As a result, we’re always ready to fight or flee. This helps us survive because, counter to the logic of positive thinking, it’s beneficial to anticipate less-than-ideal outcomes. Doing so helps us prepare for, deal with and sometimes prevent bad things. To see such logic in action, consider the security of health or life insurance or the inclination to get an abnormal mole checked out by a doctor. Let’s turn to the tremendous dangers of positive thinking, for a moment. Consider the blind optimism of the Bush administration leading up to the attacks of September 11, 2001. The government was well aware of potential clues before the attacks, such as warnings about an impending terrorist strike involving a plane and suspicious student pilots. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the president refused to believe these details, and therefore failed to take precautions that could have saved thousands of American lives. The key message in this book: A culture of positive thinking has pervaded American society, influencing everything from health to religion to work. While optimism and willpower are celebrated as helpful and even fundamental to improving our lives, such a belief promotes behavior that blinds us to reality.  Got feedback?

This quote from the movie 300 came to internet fame in 2006 and since then, the movie’s fierce Spartan warriors have been a household image. Sparta was the strongest military force among all the ancient Greek city-states, and it was indeed known for the strength, energy and mentality of its soldiers. But how can we apply their example to our modern lives? We can take the image of hardened Spartan soldiers as an inspiration for how to lift our modern, soft and comfortable lives out of everyday mediocrity. Through the lens of extreme sports, Spartan Up! gives us ideas on how we can lead more exciting and fulfilling lives. In these blinks, you’ll discover how the author still remembers the name of the woman who was a janitor at his university; why the roots of honesty are essential for a modern Spartan; and why we should live by the ideals of the Greek philosopher Epictetus. The people of Sparta, the ancient Greek city-state, defended their homeland through intense physical and mental preparation. It might be thousands of years later, but you can still learn from their legendary abilities and become a Spartan yourself. Life’s comforts make our existence predictable and boring. They disconnect us from our true passions and goals, but you can overcome that lethargy by taking a real jump into life.  That jump could be extreme sports, for instance. Joe de Sena, the author, organizes various extreme sports events, such as the Death Race. Death Race isn’t just an over-the-top name – participants actually sign a waiver certifying that they know they could die during the challenge.  The Death Race contains several events, such as diving for pennies in cold water, walking 50 kilometers and lifting rocks for hours. Afterwards, de Sena often gets grateful messages from participants who say it changed their lives for the better.  However, you’ll only be able to handle physical challenges like this if you have strong endurance skills. So build your endurance through self-discipline and by delaying your own gratification.  It’s easy to get quick satisfaction in the modern world, but resisting instant gratification is an important part of personal development; Walter Mischel’s famous marshmallow experiment does a good job of illustrating this.   In the experiment, Mischel presented children with a marshmallow. The children were told that if they waited to eat it, they’d get another. Mischel then left the room to see what the children would do when left alone with the treat. Years later, Mischel follows up on the lives of these children. The study showed that the children who had the self-discipline to resist the marshmallow grew up to be wealthier and healthier than those who didn’t. Challenges in adulthood are similar: you have to resist immediate gratification and hold out for something better.  At any given time, life can be easy or challenging – but it’s up to you to make life fulfilling. You never know when hard times will hit, so keep building your endurance skills. You’ll be more prepared for challenges and more adventurous, too.  The first part of meeting a goal is planning for it. Plans can tell you where you’re going.  Sign up for activities in advance whenever you can, like boxing lessons or dance workshops. When you’ve committed to something in advance, you’re forced to be honest with yourself if you don’t go.  The word honesty comes from honor, a core value in any Spartan’s life. Part of leading an honest life is following through with what you’ve said you’d do.  When following your plan, keep a success-and-failure journal where you can record your progress and give yourself credit for any achievements.  Anyone can be a part of your plan. One of de Sena’s college professors taught his students the value of this when, on a written test, he asked the name of the woman who worked as a janitor at the university.  The students assumed it was a joke – but it wasn’t. The professor wanted his students to appreciate everyone who works to make their lives better and is therefore a part of their plans. That’s how you build strong relationships, which are a key component of realizing your goals.  The lesson had a profound impact on de Sana, and he remembers that woman’s name to this day: Sarah.  In terms of health, planning your diet is just as important to your fitness as planning your workout. Don’t get sucked into overcomplicated fads; diet plans should be simple.  De Sana disagrees with most mainstream diet tips. He believes that diets should be restricted to fundamental ingredients like water, raw fruits and vegetables.  Planning your meals is especially important because you don’t always have access to good food. If you only want the best, you have to plan ahead and spend time cooking or finding healthy restaurants.  Spartans plan so they can get the best out of their efforts. This doesn’t just apply to sports and health – it’s true in all aspects of life. Which feels better: a day spent lounging on the couch or a day spent working out and eating healthy food? The first might be more comfortable in some ways, but it’s certainly less healthy.  Most people eat processed, unhealthy foods that might taste good in the moment but cause serious long-term problems. Almost every standard food product has unnatural amounts of sugar: juice, sauces, sodas or cakes are just a few examples.  Sugar causes your brain to produce more dopamine, so it’s easy to get addicted to it. And a sugar addiction increases your risk of developing diabetes.  This trend has become a very serious problem. Since 2000, the number of Americans who have diabetes or prediabetes has risen from nine percent to 23 percent.  Eating right isn’t just about your physical health – it improves your mental health, too. A true Spartan has strong willpower, and studies have shown that willpower is strengthened by healthy foods like greens, fruits and nuts.  After all, our bodies are designed to extract nutrients from those kinds of foods, not from unnatural foods with colorants or additives.  Unhealthy food is one of modern society’s major problems, but most of us have another serious issue on our hands: we’re passive. Passiveness makes our lives dry, dull and insignificant.  Children naturally avoid being passive. They exercise without realizing it; they explore, take risks and discover things for themselves.  But we lose these abilities as adults. Instead, we adopt society’s standards that tell us to avoid anything that’s new or that requires effort. This leads us into a life of mediocrity.  Modern-day ailments like stress, depression, lethargy and anxiety can all be relieved through exercise. When you exercise, your brain produces a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.  BDNF makes your stress levels drop, so exercising on a regular basis will help you stay mentally fit, too. Have you ever heard the phrase “less is more”? This saying isn’t always true (such as during repetitive training) but in most aspects of life, the simpler path is the better one.  That’s because you limit yourself when overanalyzing things. It’s simpler and more effective to just act.  De Sena is often asked how exactly he achieved certain goals, and he responds by saying that he did it without thinking. This is especially the case when it comes to extreme activities like running marathons on two consecutive days with no sleep! Overanalyzing the feat would just slow him down. One great strategy for achieving your goals is to just keep trying until you succeed. Repetition allows tasks to become hardwired into  your brain’s neural pathways, so the task at hand becomes easier each time you do it. That’s a key part of reaching your goals! De Sana was rejected by colleges three times in a row because of his severe Attention Deficit Disorder, but he kept trying. On his fourth attempt, he got in. He never begged anyone or tried to bargain; he just applied again and again. Leading a simpler life would also make you happier.  Society teaches us that happiness results from external factors, and it also teaches us that we never have enough. The outlook that results from the combination of these two ideas can make even the richest people feel miserable.  In fact, de Sena came from a rich family, but his wealth spoiled him and made him unable to appreciate the little things in life. Happiness is really about feeling satisfied with what you have, which is why Epictetus, the Greek Stoic philosopher, once defined happiness as having few wants.   So keep things simple. Complex problems don’t always require complex solutions. In the realm of exercise, squats are a great example. They consist of one simple movement, but they train nearly every important muscle in your body.  When you push yourself to the limits of your physical abilities, you might accidentally go too far. So how should a modern Spartan think about safety? There’s always a risk when it comes to extreme activities. Sometimes people get too excited or panic and go over the edge, causing serious harm to themselves or others. It’s important to be motivated, but you also have to evaluate situations rationally so you can prevent injuries to the greatest extent possible. Some Death Race attendees, for example, are incredibly irresponsible. They continue racing when they have life-threatening injuries or after the organizers tell them to stop. The organizers have to try to make such participants leave the event as quickly as possible. In life, there are perceived limits and real limits. You need to know and respect the difference. So accept a real limit you have now, but keep trying to succeed in the future. You or your circumstances can always change, and you might be able to overcome your previous limits. In fact, de Sena wasn’t athletic in his youth, but he never gave up and eventually surprised even himself with his skills in extreme sports. You can push yourself but you can’t force yourself to work endlessly. Make sure you take in the right nutrients so you can push yourself in an effective way. Low energy levels can limit you. Energy drinks, for instance, are useless. They’ll give you a quick, short-term high but the glucose in them won’t help you in the long run. Finally, don’t complain about things you can’t control; a real Spartan doesn’t waste their time on such things. In fact, the expression stoic calm comes from the ancient Greek stoic philosophers’ acceptance of the more difficult sides of life. They key message in this book: Never give up! Life can be tough sometimes but you have to be even tougher. Outline a plan for yourself, stick to it and stay dedicated. Keep yourself mentally and physically healthy and don’t succumb to the modern life of boredom and mediocrity. There’s still a place for Spartans in today’s world.  Actionable advice: Go outside your comfort zone. Push yourself to do something extreme! It could be related to sports, education, travel or anything else, as long as you’re interested and you’re not used to doing it. Travel to Niagara Falls or read a psychology dissertation. Push your limits and remember: comfort is the enemy! Suggested further reading: The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday In The Obstacle is the Way, Ryan Holiday brings the age-old wisdom of Stoic philosophy up to date. By examining the struggles of historical figures of inspiring resilience, Holiday shows not only how obstacles couldn’t stop them, but more importantly, how these people thrived precisely because of the obstacles. Holiday shows how we can turn obstacles to our advantage, and how we can transform apparent roadblocks into success, both in our businesses and our personal lives. Got feedback?

If you’re tired of being like everyone else and are ready to start being awesome, these blinks are the path that will get you there. Importantly, you’ll learn how to get past the most difficult block to your amazing new life’s journey: the very start. Find out how to overcome the fear that holds you back from living your dreams and start your own personal journey to being awesome! In the following blinks, you’ll also learn: why sometimes you have to be illogical to be awesome; how to edit your life of elements that don’t bring you joy; and how to deal with haters who try to get in the way of your ultimate success. Do you dream of escaping the average? Do you want to become awesome and exceptional, but don’t know where to start? Here’s a tip: If you want to become awesome, you have to punch fear in the face. Fear can alienate you from your dreams. It goes without saying that you shouldn’t let it, but to beat fear, you have to understand how it works. Fear prevents you from chasing your dreams by convincing you that they’re impractical or unattainable. But don’t buy into that kind of defeatist thinking. Instead, write down your fears and then exaggerate them ridiculously, to show yourself how silly those fears actually are. For example, if you’re afraid that starting a new project will cause you to lose your job and stay unemployed, write that down. And then let yourself go farther. Imagine you’ll end up on the street with a scraggly beard, sleeping on top of garbage bags and talking to stray cats. Does that seem likely? Probably not, which is why you need to write it down. That way you can see how illogical your fears really are, and thus prevent them from controlling you. Luckily, there’s one more effective way to deal with fear’s mind games: Just start doing whatever you’re scared of.  You have no control over the eventual result, but that won’t ever change. You’ll never know how things will end up, but at least you can control the outset. If you want to do something, do it! For example, consider the Segway. When it was first introduced, people thought it might spark a transportation revolution. And yet, since its launch the Segway hasn’t been such a great success. Still, the Segway people deserve respect. They risked failure and pursued their awesome dream of developing weird, two-wheeled electric transporters. If you want to be awesome, you have to get comfortable with tension. You have to be a realist and a dreamer, practical and impractical, logical and illogical – all at the same time. To start your journey, you need to find out which parts of your life feel average. Do this by examining key areas of your life – social, intellectual, professional – and writing down which ones you want to improve. Here’s where the tension comes in. Although you should dream big, it’s also important to be realistic. List current debts, responsibilities (are you a husband, a father, a coach?) and assets (university degrees or social connections) that would affect your ability to pursue your dream. For example, the author wanted to start an ad agency with a friend. They agreed to build a website for their first client, a church. After a few months of effort, the author faced some tough realities: He had no idea how to run a business. Also, he’d never built a website before, and neither he nor his partner had any programming skills. In the end, they decided to quit the project and refund the church. What went wrong here? Well, the author had been wildly unrealistic. Learn from his mistakes. Your current reality doesn’t have to be a cage, but it is a jumping-off point. If the author had been realistic about his lack of experience, maybe he would have started a smaller project and managed to complete it successfully. Still, acknowledging your reality shouldn’t prevent you from dreaming big! Write down every crazy dream you have – even if you’ve never played an instrument, but want to rock a major festival. Next to your dreams, write down a list of first steps that could get you there. Then pick one and get going! What is it with people needing to find their purpose? Most people use finding their purpose as a smokescreen to avoid doing anything. Don’t be like them: Forget about finding a purpose. Think about all the pressure you put on yourself when you say that you want to find your one and only, true reason for being. That much pressure is going to prevent you from doing anything, much less what you were meant to do. This is especially important advice if you’re young. Many teenagers and twenty-somethings freak out because they haven’t figured out a life path. They shouldn’t worry. Scientists believe that our brains continue developing well into our twenties, so how is a not-yet-fully-formed teenager or a fresh college graduate supposed to figure out a purpose to guide the rest of his or her life? Besides, waiting around until you find your purpose later will only prevent you from living with purpose today. So stop waiting for some big epiphany. Wherever you happen to be now, start living with purpose. When you go to work, for instance, do it with purpose: Write those thank-you notes for employees and colleagues by hand today. Love your partner with purpose: Buy tickets for a show you’ll both enjoy, and make dinner reservations for your favorite restaurant beforehand. You can even vacation with purpose by only checking your email once a day. Do you really need to be available for emergencies around the clock? Instead of living for someone else, take your vacation into your own hands! So, now that you’re ready to start being awesome, it’s time to get familiar with the five stages of success. How do you get to the magical land of awesomeness? There are five stages, and the first one is all about learning – that is, trying many different things and gaining experience. After all, how can you know what you want to do if you haven’t tried a bunch of different things? Think about it like this: When a scientific experiment fails, the scientist isn’t deemed a failure. We understand that even if the experiment didn’t work, the scientist still learned something valuable. This gradual learning process is what allows people to become awesome. After all, no one is born an expert. Consider Tiger Woods: He won the Masters when he was only 21 years old. That might seem young, but remember, he had been practicing for 18 years to get to that point! So, to start the learning process, ask yourself this question: If you died tomorrow, what would you most regret having never done? Are you doing that thing now? Why not? And then just start doing it! But start small. For example, if you want to learn Chinese, find 30 minutes a week to sit down and get a feel for the basics. Studies have shown that taking these kinds of small steps will prevent you from getting exhausted and giving up. Take Roy Baumeister’s famous 1998 experiment. Participants were divided into two groups – one group had permission to eat delicious cookies and the other was only allowed radishes. Then both groups were given a tricky geometry exercise. The group that had eaten cookies made a concerted effort to solve the puzzle; meanwhile, the group that was only allowed radishes quickly gave up, because they had used up all their willpower denying themselves cookies. The point is, your willpower is finite. So plan to tackle the most difficult tasks in the morning and not late at night, when your willpower is mostly depleted by a day’s worth of self-control. Now that you’ve mastered the art of learning, you have to focus on something. This second stage of success is all about editing your life. In the previous blink, we saw that learning is all about trying many different things. In fact, learning is a way of gaining possibilities and options. Unfortunately, you can’t be an expert in everything. So start editing: Look at all the different things you’ve learned, and then choose one you want to develop. For example, if you have a passion both for writing and for giving speeches, you have to decide which skill you want to spend more time developing. The other one you can pursue as a hobby, or come back to it later in your life. In fact, make your own “later list” with possible future paths. But in the meantime, ask yourself: What gives you the most joy? It’s important to phrase the question exactly that way. Normally, we ask different kinds of questions – we ask result questions: What will earn us more money? Which industries are growing? Where does my experience lie? And although these are important questions, asking them isn’t the right way to start. Just because certain jobs will allow you to earn money doesn’t mean they’ll deliver you to the magical land of awesomeness. That’s because being awesome means doing something that inspires you. And once you’ve figured out what does, you’ll have plenty of jobs from which to choose. For example, let’s say that you’ve edited your life and realized that you absolutely love sharing ideas. You can apply this in so many ways: You could become a blogger, an author, a podcast host, a counselor or a copywriter. Whatever it is that you want to learn, just start working on it. And if halfway through, you realize that it’s not your way to awesome, simply edit it and move on to the next thing! Now that you’ve figured out what you want to focus on, it’s time to take the next step, to mastery. So what is the best approach for becoming an expert? The trick is to start simple. Volunteer somewhere; that is, trade your time for expertise. You’ll need to do this in order to get better at whatever you’re passionate about. For example, if you want to become an awesome blogger, start by checking out and commenting on a lot of different blogs. Eventually, you can offer to write guests posts for free. This will allow you to improve your blogging skills while simultaneously connecting with the blogging community. The first step? Create a list of people who are already doing what you’d like to do. How did they get where they are? What schools did they go to? What books have they read? What can you do to follow in their footsteps? Next, prepare yourself for the inevitable feedback you’ll get as you pursue your passion. This is crucial, because no matter who you are or what you’re working on, you’ll encounter haters. Thus, you’ll need to understand the difference between sheer hatred and constructive criticism. Constructive criticism is there to help you improve; hatred, on the other hand, is just meant to hurt you. Once you’ve identified hatred, you can deal with it by asking yourself two questions: Where did the hurtful comment come from? If it’s from a stranger, especially online, let it go. You probably wouldn’t tolerate it if a random person yelled at you in real life; why would you listen to a stranger online? Why did they say it? Just thinking about the other person’s perspective might allow you to feel better. Sometimes haters simply want attention; other times, they’re lashing out because they’re struggling with something in their own life. The fourth stage is all about harvesting all the great things you’ve been working on. This is actually a tricky time, because the closer you get to something, the more you realize how much is still left to do. Deal with any loss of motivation by creating small finish lines for yourself. That way you’ll reach a goal each week and keep the momentum going. For example, writing a book can take months. The best way to tackle such a big project is to divide the work into chapters, each with its own deadline. Alternately, you can set a goal with the number of words you want to write each day or each week. When you meet these smaller goals, you’ll stay motivated to keep going. It’s also important to keep your focus. Once you start reaching big goals, people around you might tell you to start aiming for more. This can be an enticing message. For example, if you’ve started a business that’s not earning a profit, “more” could mean making your venture profitable. But be skeptical. Whenever someone encourages you to pursue “more,” ask them why you should. Think of the entrepreneur who sacrifices time with his family to chase ever-bigger profits. Is he really so awesome? Figure out what matters to you, and stick to it. To stay on track, think about what you did to get to this stage and figure out what’s no longer necessary for your path. For example, if you’ve started a blog, you probably spent a lot of energy attracting followers at first. Maybe you spent lots of time commenting on other people’s blogs to draw people to your site. Well, now that your blog is popular in its own right, you don’t have to spend so much time commenting on other people’s sites. Instead, dedicate yourself to delivering what your readers want. Let’s say you made it to the end of your awesomeness journey. What’s next? Sharing the love!   Now that you’ve found something you love, you can guide others to follow their own version of the path. As it turns out, helping other people is incredibly satisfying. How does this process work? Well, guiding others starts with a conversation. When you’re helping someone, it’s not about you, so ask questions! The only way to give good guidance is to be a good listener, so practice asking questions and listening to what people say. To ensure you actually stick to the guiding path, connect it to something that’s already important in your life. For example, the author and his friend sought mutual guidance from each other. They tried to meet for breakfast regularly, but they were both too busy, and only managed to see each other sporadically. Then they realized they both like to work out, so they decided to start going to the gym together. Now they meet, chat and guide each other three times a week, while they’re working out. Guiding is great, but don’t get stuck doing only that. Always look for aspects of your own life that you want to develop, and then go all the way back to stage one – to the learning stage – and start the journey to awesomeness all over again. For example, let’s say you improved your career prospects and training, and finally landed a fantastic new job. Congrats! But don’t let your success make you lazy. Remember the “later list” you made during the editing stage? Pick something you haven’t awesomified yet and get to it. Now’s the time to start! The key message in this book: You can stop being average and start being awesome, but first you have to know where to start. It’s all about overcoming your fear, living with purpose and following the five stages of success: learning new skills, editing to find your passion, mastering an expertise, harvesting the results and then guiding others. Actionable advice: Write down all of your biggest, wildest, craziest dreams!  Don’t hold back: If you’ve always wanted to be a pop star, a race car driver, an astronaut, write it down! Then, once you’ve made your list, go back and write down the first step you could take that would allow you to accomplish each goal. Then start!

It’s taken for granted that bigger is better. As a result, we spend our lives chasing rewards, trying to accumulate resources and desiring what others have. There are obvious drawbacks to this outlook when it comes to happiness and peace, but the truth is it’s not even a recipe for success. In reality, you’re much better off focusing on what you can accomplish with what you’ve already got. That’s why you should adopt a new perspective. These blinks explain why you should forget about chasing, and start thinking about stretching. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to stretch your resources to the limit; why planning isn’t necessarily good; and how your self-expectations influence your success.   If you saw your neighbor driving home in a shiny new car, how would it make you feel? For most people, the sight might cause a pang of jealousy. After all, the entire human conception of success is based on having better stuff than others. This habit is called chasing and it pushes us to pursue things we don’t actually need. For instance, researchers at Vanderbilt University found that people literally tend to perceive their neighbor’s lawn as greener than their own. It may be a cliché, but, in the popular imagination, a healthy green lawn means success and prosperity. The desire for such status symbols is in fact so powerful that people work tirelessly to have the best lawn in the neighborhood. However, the results are often for naught: Meticulously manicuring your lawn necessarily means diverting resources from what makes you truly happy! So what’s the solution? Well, on the other end of the spectrum from chasing is what’s called the stretcher mindset. In a nutshell, it refers to focusing on what you want to accomplish with the resources at your disposal. In order to have a stretcher mindset, the first step is to feel assured that you’re in control. For example, say you work in a clothing store. Retail can be soul crushing, but by simply imagining yourself as the owner of the store you can boost your confidence in an instant. Just thinking that you’re in charge of the circumstances will help you seize the reins and tap into your creativity. Beyond that, staying mindful of the situation at hand and the resources at your disposal will compel you to be creative with what you’ve got. In other words, you’ll have to recognize your limits and, once you know what you can and can’t do, you’ll be able to creatively pursue the options before you. That’s why studies have found that teams with a deadline or budget produce better results than those with more open-ended parameters. When making an important decision, whether it’s choosing a new IT system at the office or a medical treatment for an illness in the family, people tend to place their trust in experts. However, experts aren’t always the most reliable people. In fact, traditional experts often don’t have the best perspective. For instance, in 20 years of analyzing political issues, the psychologist Phil Tetlock found that experts aren’t any better at predicting future events than your average person, regardless of their professional experience. Whether people were liberal or conservative, optimistic or pessimistic, the results were the same. In most cases, the experts and non-experts offered comparable prognoses. In fact, professional experience can actually be a hindrance. As people gain experience, they also become stuck in their knowledge, unable to move past conventional approaches. As a result, outsiders tend to overshadow experts. Outsiders are newcomers to a field, people who lack deep experience. Naturally, you can’t be a newcomer at all times, but you can think like an outsider. It’s as easy as following four steps: First, explore the world and experience new things that help you see them from a different angle. For example, if you’re a political expert, you might go to a musical, watch a cartoon or do something that’s entirely unrelated to the political world. But you also need to stay in touch with what you already know, which is the second step. Of course, you can’t know everything about your field, so work to share your ideas with others, seeking feedback and learning as you go. From there you can move on to the third step: looking for solutions outside of your own domain. The design company IDEO offers a good example. They have an open office in which employees hear about the problems and innovations of other departments, thereby inspiring them to find solutions to their own problems. And finally, whatever ideas and innovations you do develop, it’s key to constantly test your assumptions, expecting that most of them will fail. Whether it’s for a summer vacation or a work project, most people love having a plan. Planning offers a comfortable roadmap to follow, ensuring that we’ll achieve the best results. But there’s a downside, too. Planning can also cause us to miss out on all kinds of beneficial things. Often, people learn more by acting than by planning. For instance, the Stanford professor Kathy Eisenhardt found that executive teams who make more rapid-fire decisions tend to collect more information and generate more alternatives than those with long and detailed plans. That’s because quick-acting teams focus on the present, working with real-time information about their work and competition. Planners, on the other hand, tend to spend most of their time and energy trying to figure out what the future might look like. Beyond that, planning can cause us to miss valuable information that’s right in front of our eyes. After all, burying your head in project planning can make it difficult to notice your surroundings. Just take an experiment by the psychologist Malcolm Brenner. Brenner asked participants to speak and listen simultaneously. He found that, as it came time for a subject to speak, it was common for her to block out outside information. She directed her energy to what she was planning to say. The same thing happened as participants finished speaking. They would reflect on what they had said, missing how others were reacting to their words. Simply put, whether it’s for a project or for what to say next, planning causes us to miss out on the world unfolding around us. That’s why, instead of planning, stretchers embrace improvisation as the key to progress. After all, when we improvise, we free ourselves up to move and use resources in the most efficient way. We can bend, stretch and position ourselves relative to challenges in the world, making the actions we take all the more effective. People often act as we expect they will – a fact that can have a major effect on our interpersonal interactions. Expectations influence experience, and they can define relationships, too. Our expectations are essentially images of people or things that we haven’t yet encountered. Just imagine a new employee joins your company. You haven’t so much as spoken to him but your coworker assures you that he’s a jerk. When you do meet this new colleague, you’ll likely treat him differently than if you hadn’t heard anything about him. However, expectations shape more than just first impressions. They also direct feelings in ongoing relationships. Consider the example above. Now that you have a bad impression of your new officemate, you might send him signals that express these negative feelings. As you ask him rude questions or adopt a cold tone when speaking with him, you’ll eventually lead him to view you as a jerk as well. So expectations can damage your relationships with others, but the expectations you hold about yourself can also affect the way you handle challenging situations. That’s because having lower expectations about your abilities will lead you to see challenges as threats, making it harder for you to rise to the occasion. Such a mindset can have a pretty bad effect. Being scared or mistrusting your ability will lead to hesitation and passivity. As a result, when faced with a challenge – say, the chance to give a speech at a conference – you’ll shrink away from the opportunity. Instead of welcoming a new experience, you’ll block yourself and choose to remain passive instead. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Stretchers know that you can overcome such obstacles by developing positive self-expectations, leading to a transformation that allows you to see challenges as opportunities. If you regard that speech as an opportunity to demonstrate your skills at the podium, you’ll not only take on the task, you’ll also gain new skills and open up greater resources for future growth. Whether it’s a morning coffee ritual or an evening stroll, everyday routines give you a structure that helps you accomplish more things in a shorter time. That being said, people also tend to see routines as boring and inflexible. So how can you get the most out of your routine without letting it bog you down? It’s simple, actually: add a touch of creativity. This will help you transform the way you understand your routine and the way it functions. Stretchers do this on a regular basis by mixing up combinations in their routine work. In other words, you can do the same exact things every day and, as long as your individuality shines through, always feel that your work is new and exciting. For instance, you could probably get your kid’s lunch ready for school on autopilot. But if you adopt a stretcher mindset, you might think to add a little note to your son’s lunch, wishing him a great day. This little touch of creativity will make him happier and get you out of your routine without disrupting your day. Injecting a dose of creativity can do wonders for a stretcher and a similar approach can be used to challenge your assumptions about competitors. For most people, competitors are there to be beaten. But this outlook isn’t necessarily conducive to coexisting with competitors. A better strategy is to treat them like friends. Working to beat the competition may be a great motivation, but it’s not as good as working together. Just take the professors Paul Ingram and Peter Roberts, both of whom studied hotel managers. They found that managers who were friends with their competitors brought in 15 percent more revenue than those without other manager friends. These friendships positively impacted the work of the managers by giving them greater access to knowledge about their field and prospective clients. It’s just one more reason to break down mental barriers, get creative and focus on building relationships. Now that you’ve got a sense of what it takes to be a successful stretcher, it’s time for another important lesson: how to avoid overstretching. Without this knowledge about how to keep yourself in check, you’ll risk injuring yourself or others. To stay safe, just avoid these common mistakes: The first way that people tend to overstretch is by becoming a cheapskate. For instance, while carefully managing your resources is key to being a stretcher, there’s a limit to how far you can go. Remember, the difference between being economical and being a cheapskate is that the former saves to invest in something meaningful while the latter is scared of spending any money at all. The second risk is that of spreading yourself too thin or looking in too many directions at once. To avoid going down paths that have nothing to offer, you should make your career your number-one priority. Become a specialist in your field and learn everything you can about it. Once you’ve established that base, you can begin exploring new ideas. Third, keep in mind that changes can often be helpful, but only after you’ve properly analyzed the past. Without this reflection, you risk leaping without learning. In other words, failure is a great way to learn, but only if you properly consider what went wrong. For instance, if your business goes bankrupt, you should certainly prepare to found a new one, but only after you understand why your first attempt went belly up. Fourth, while you know now that having high expectations can foster confidence and courage, having unrealistically high expectations is a recipe for disaster. Nobody expects to run a marathon after their first jog, so be realistic about your goals. Otherwise, you’ll risk disappointment at every turn, no matter how much you succeed. And, finally, when mixing up your routine, make sure that you strike a balance between novelty and usefulness. Without a good mix of the two, you’ll be in danger of producing a toxic mixture that will kill innovation. As people age, they start to learn that working out is necessary to avoid injuries, and the same goes for stretchers. But instead of hitting the gym, the ticket here is to work on balance, specifically between your existing resources and your exploration of new things. Look around and identify the resources you have at your disposal but haven’t used. This can turn up all kinds of gems. For instance, a recent Indiana University study found that the most important scientific papers were “sleeping beauties,” papers that were published but forgotten. Identifying your own sleeping beauties is crucial. You’ve got to ask the right question, namely, what personal resources, skills, connections or ideas have you left unused? Make a list of all these resources along with their potential to help you advance an objective and you’ll have a good sense of where to focus. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to explore new things. Just set aside a few hours each week to read something new, go to a workshop or spend time working with new colleagues. You never know what kind of ideas you’ll stumble upon. But flexing those balancing muscles won’t be effective if you don’t also take breaks to be grateful for all the hard work you’ve done. After all, too much concentration can be a disaster for creativity. If you feel overwhelmed by your work, you should take a breather. Get out of the office. Spend some casual time with a client. Take an afternoon stroll. This last one is great because it’s simple and effective. A group of Stanford University psychologists even found that people who take a walk during their breaks are 81 percent more efficient compared to those who sit. Another great way to decompress is by spending time reflecting on what you’re grateful for. This can be as simple as setting aside time once a week to write down five things in your life that make you feel gratitude. This will help you see the overall picture, and remind you what it is you’re stretching toward. The key message in this book: You have all the resources you need to be successful right in front of you, it’s just a matter of identifying and prioritizing them. So, rather than chasing after what other people have, focus on what you’ve got and expand from there. Look at things like a newcomer, beware the pitfalls of planning, get creative with your routine, be sure not to overstretch and engage in some mental workouts. And when you need a breather, remember what you’re grateful for. Actionable advice: Take a moment to reflect. The next time you find yourself rushing into a new project, take a few days off for a trip. Get out of your environment and break free from your routine.

Whether it’s teaming up with friends for an evening of Call of Duty, a sweaty session of aerobics on Wii Sports or a few minutes of Angry Birds on the bus to work, computer games have become a big part of our lives. And, actually, people have always played games. it’s part of what makes us human. You might think of games simply as entertainment or a way to relax. But, as these blinks will show you, there’s much more to games than that. Introducing a spirit of gaming into your life can strengthen your cognitive skills, help you overcome prejudices and propel toward your goal. In short, they can help you become superbetter. In these blinks, you’ll learn how throwing snowballs can relieve pain; why games improve your social skills; and what you can learn from Zelda. Have you ever heard of SuperBetter? It’s a game created by the author, who came up with the idea while recovering from a brain injury. During her recovery, she realized that she didn’t just want to get better, she wanted to be even better than she was before the injury – superbetter! So she created a game to help her get there.  Games make it fun and exciting to overcome challenges. And they can even alleviate stress and interpersonal problems! SuperBetter is literally designed to empower you and give you more control over your life whenever you’re feeling overwhelmed by illness or any other serious problem. SuperBetter works because of two human phenomena: post-traumatic growth and post-ecstatic growth.  Trauma doesn’t necessarily lead to long-term emotional or mental problems. In fact, trauma can usher in a life that’s happier and more fulfilling than the one you had before! That’s how post-traumatic growth works.  You don’t need trauma to experience personal growth, however. If you overcome challenges you set for yourself, such as running a marathon or quitting smoking, you can undergo post-ecstatic growth.  Post-traumatic growth and post-ecstatic growth are forms of positive development that you experience during difficult times. And, if you follow the seven steps outlined in the SuperBetter method, you’ll stand a much better chance of growing. These steps, the effectiveness of which has been thoroughly tested and proved, will help you build physical resilience, mental resilience, emotional resilience and social resilience. Read on to learn more about these terms – and why games are so good at helping you build them! On average, over one billion people spend at least one hour per day playing video games.  And those games lend themselves to more than just fun. They can actually alleviate physical pain and help people overcome trauma! This was demonstrated by a recent study on burn victims. Severe burns cause pain that can’t be lessened with medication; however, a group of researchers found that burn victims benefited from playing Snow World, a 3D game about a virtual world of ice caves and snowballs. If they played Snow World while undergoing painful treatments, they felt less pain.  Games like Snow World have this effect because they control a person’s attention spotlight. Generally, your brain is constantly being bombarded with signals. Pain, being a particularly strong signal, usually gets the most attention. But if a patient directs their brain’s attention elsewhere – toward a game like Snow World, for instance – the impact of all other signals is lessened.  Another study found that Tetris helped reduce flashbacks. If, within six hours of some traumatic event – a serious car accident, for example – a patient played ten minutes of Tetris, the patient, though still able to remember the accident, experienced fewer involuntary flashbacks. When we play games, we don’t just give them our attention, either. We pay them a special kind of attention called flow, the state of being completely absorbed in an activity.  Flow isn’t about distraction; it’s about engagement. So leisure activities like watching TV don’t count as flow. An activity that gets you into flow has to be challenging and interactive; you have to have more control over what you’re thinking and feeling. That’s why children who play Super Mario Bros before going into surgery feel less anxiety and need less medication: they’re simply less focused on their fear of the surgery. Comic books or TV shows don’t provide the same release because they don’t require the same kind of cognitive absorption.  When confronted with a big challenge, it’s easy to feel alone. But remember: you’re never really alone! Everyone is surrounded by potential allies – you just have to find them.  Humans naturally mimic those around them. They imitate each other’s speech patterns. They fall into step when walking down the street. And the more time people spend together, the better they get at predicting each other’s thoughts and actions. When two people play the same game in the same room, they develop a strong neurological and physiological bond. They display the same facial expressions; their heartbeats even settle into a similar rhythm – and this happens regardless of whether they’re playing with or against each other. And the bond goes even further than that: we’re also more likely to like someone if we’re playing a game with them. That’s because we’re drawn to people we perceive as similar to ourselves.  Playing video games with someone can connect you in other ways, too. Another study found that when a younger and elder person bowled together on Wii Sports, they both developed more positive opinions about their game partner’s age group. If they only watched TV together, they developed a more positive opinion of that person, but not of their age group as a whole. Games can open up whole new worlds of friends! The Middle East Gaming Challenge is founded on just such findings. It brings together Israelis and Palestinians in hopes of bridging differences with gaming.  It’s important for gaming partners to be in the same room, however. Excessive competition against strangers not in the same room generates negative feelings, like anger and aggression, especially after a loss. If the players are in the same room, on the other hand, they develop empathy for each other.  Do you struggle with motivation at times? If you feel unmotivated or discouraged, don’t fret – because games are here to help! Games boost your motivation, confidence and strength. They can also build character by improving your work ethic and sense of compassion. After all, they make you the hero of your own story! In the game Re-Mission, for example, the player fights cancer cells in the human body with chemotherapy blasters and antibiotic grenades. It was designed to help young cancer patients stay strong-willed during difficult treatments.  The game fosters optimism and reinforces a sense of control. Re-Mission also helps patients internalize the message that every treatment dose counts, because the blaster gets weaker with every dose that’s missed. People who played for just two hours adhered better to their medication schedule for three months.  Young cancer patients who played Re-Mission also reported feeling more powerful and optimistic. That state of mind is called self-efficacy: the belief that you have the power to effect positive change in your life. Once you’ve developed a strong sense of self-efficacy, it tends to stick around. And the confidence you build playing games shows up in your everyday life, too. Video games increase your level of dopamine, the brain’s pleasure neurotransmitter, which also increases your motivation and determination.  Every time you’re faced with a decision, your brain does a quick cost-benefit analysis – and the result usually depends on your dopamine level! If your dopamine level is high, you worry less about the decision’s pitfalls and focus more on its potentially positive results. That makes you more determined to succeed and less discouraged by setbacks.  Again, this affects more than just your gaming. When you play games, you train your brain. Dedicated gamers spend more time solving problems – and so they’re more persistent and have a stronger work ethic, as well as a more positive outlook on what they can achieve.  Video games cause some people to become antisocial shut-ins; others become more creative and hardworking. What accounts for this difference? The effect games have on your life doesn’t depend on which games you play or how long you play them. It depends on why you play.  Not all people play games for educational or social reasons. Some play games as a form of escape from the problems of life – and that’s when gaming becomes harmful. If you play games with a positive goal, however, you’re more likely to reap the benefits and feel happier in your non-gaming life, too.  And consciously developing a positive gaming mindset is easy, even if you started out as an escapist player. Just remember that games can be a source of strength, skill and willpower. Everyone experiences a form of immersion when they play games, but that immersion can be self-suppressive or self-expansive, depending on the person’s motivation for playing.  If you’re playing in order to avoid something, that’s self-suppressive. The burn victims who play Snow World are, in part, trying to avoid pain. But it’s also a proactive activity, something that empowers them to face their treatment – and that’s self-expansive immersion.  Video games also do more than help you overcome challenges! They hone your visual attention and spatial intelligence, and studies show that they improve your problem-solving skills and creativity with storytelling.  If you play them right, video games put you in a better mood, too. You’ll get better at managing your own frustration, especially if you play multiplayer games that depend on strong team coordination and communication.  Now let’s get back to SuperBetter. SuperBetter gives your life structure. It consists of seven simple steps – no matter what kind of challenge you’re trying to overcome or what kind of positive change you’re trying to achieve, there are always seven steps. The philosopher Bernard Suits defined a “game” as a “voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.” There’s no logical reason for attempting to hit a small white ball into a hole with a thin metal club – but we do it because golf is fun. You also volunteer to be challenged (by your opponent or the game itself) when you play a game, which puts you in a more competitive mindset: a challenge mindset. The game won’t always be positive – even miniature golf has bunkers! – but you’ll strive to achieve the most positive outcome in the situation.  So challenge yourself to a game of overcoming an obstacle to reach a certain aim! That’s the first step in SuperBetter. Your aim can be concrete, like losing 25 pounds, or more general, like learning about opera.  Substituting a challenge mindset for a threat mindset is the foundation of living gamefully. So first, decide what challenge you want to overcome – whether it’s an illness, a new job or a new language. Remember: it’s a challenge, not a threat. Once you’ve identified your target, you can start building gaming into your life.  You’ll turn your anxiety into excitement when you do. Anxiety and excitement are similar. They induce similar bodily reactions, like excess energy, so the key is to change the way your mind interprets those physical sensations.  That’s as easy as saying “I’m excited!” aloud a few times! By doing that, you’ll change more than just your mindset. Your arteries constrict when you feel threatened and expand when you feel challenged, making you able to accomplish greater physical feats.  Super Mario fights walking turtles and seeks out mushrooms as power-ups to get stronger. As a player in the game of SuperBetter, your next two steps are to identify your power-ups and bad guys, too!  You need your own little boosts of power, just like Super Mario – and it’s up to you to collect those boosts and activate them! Power-ups can be anything, as long as they consistently make you feel stronger, happier and healthier. They don’t have to be complicated; listening to your favorite song, petting your cat or doing a few push-ups can be power-ups. Power-ups are about frequency, not intensity. The more positive little boosts you give yourself, the better equipped you’ll be to face your problems. That’s why physical power-ups, like doing a few push-ups or going for a short walk, are so beneficial. After you’ve identified some power-ups, the next step is to identify your bad guys. A bad guy is anything that blocks your progress or makes your journey or gameplay more difficult. In Scrabble, for example, the letter “J” is a bad guy because it’s difficult to use.  It’s tough to face bad guys, but doing so forces you to develop strategies for becoming a better person. Once you know who (or what) your bad guys are, you’ll develop new ways to deal with them. Scrabble players learn more words with the letter “J” so they’re prepared when they pull that dreaded tile.  You need to be flexible when facing your bad guys. Stay alert to potential obstacles and experiment with different responses to them, including simply retreating from them. Battles with bad guys are important learning experiences, even if you don’t win them all.  It’s much harder to achieve great things when you’re all alone. That’s why allies are so important! Allies are friends or family members who help you move toward your goal. And games are a good way to get social support. It’s much easier to ask someone to play a game with you than to ask them for help! Social support isn’t only important for its emotional value – it makes your body stronger, too! Even hugs affect your physiology by making you feel less stressed. So seek out some allies. You don’t need many. In fact, you only need about two solid allies to play SuperBetter with you. If you can’t find them in person, look for them online, in discussion forums or social media groups. Remember, you’re not alone: one-quarter of Americans report that they don’t have people to discuss their personal issues with. The world is full of potential SuperBetter partners. After finding some allies, the next step is to set out and complete some quests! Quests are simple, everyday activities that help you make progress in SuperBetter. Pursuing a quest means taking meaningful, conscious action to get you where you want to go. A quest could be exercising a certain muscle for a minute, writing down a dream you had or simply remembering something that makes you happy. Quests help you develop new skills and strengthen your willpower. Make at least one quest per day. Develop quests that suit you, your feelings and your values. For instance, write to five friends whenever you feel lonely. Just remember: a quest is anything that makes you feel better and stronger as a person. Your secret identity is something that empowers you. It plays off your personal strengths and makes SuperBetter more fun! That’s why the next step in SuperBetter is to do some self-reflection and develop a secret identity of your own.  A secret identity works like an avatar for the real world. The author thought of herself as Jane the Concussion Slayer when she was recovering from her brain injury and Jane of Willendorf (after Venus of Willendorf, the symbol of fertility) when she was trying to get pregnant.  Such names can have a powerful impact. Secret identities keep you focused on your strengths – those qualities that make you you.  So tell yourself a story where you’re the hero! Pick out some inspiring, heroic quotes (the author lifted some from Buffy the Vampire Slayer!) and design a logo for yourself or compose a theme song! Reveal your secret identity to your allies – it’ll bring you closer together.  The next step in SuperBetter is to aim for bigger victories: epic wins. An epic win could be sleeping one night without your iPod (if you suffer from insomnia) or going a week without your inhaler (if you suffer from asthma). Epic wins inspire you to believe in yourself. They make you less afraid of failure.  Epic wins are challenging, but realistic. They energize you, too: just thinking about them gets you excited.  It’s okay if your epic wins are tasks that are easy for others, like sitting in a cinema for three hours. If you have back pain, that could be a big accomplishment! The point of an epic win is that it was difficult for you to achieve, but you went for it anyway! The best epic wins are often physical victories, like climbing a mountain. Physical victories make an especially big difference for people suffering from psychological trauma such as PTSD.    Every video game hero has their own overarching adventure that frames everything they do. For instance, in Zelda, Link is trying to save princess Zelda.  Your quests, power-ups and bad guys all make up your adventure. Your adventure could be aimed at managing the stress of college admissions or becoming a vegetarian. The habits and skills you acquire from your daily quests move you toward achieving whatever your adventure is about.  Imagine you’re trying to become a vegetarian, for instance. If you find the smell of a cheeseburger appetizing, you’ll have to develop the skill of resisting it. Why not team up with some allies working toward the same goal and create secret identities as veggie superheroes! Design your adventure to last at least six weeks. Studies have shown that after six weeks of SuperBetter, players had significantly stronger social support networks, higher self-confidence and a more optimistic view of life.  And while you play, keep score! Keeping score isn’t about following rules; it’s about tracking your own achievement and appreciating your own accomplishments! You should ultimately aim to get at least three power-ups, battle one bad guy and tackle one quest every day. And give yourself some points for your daily achievements in terms of their “determination” value. After all, determination is what counts as you move toward your goals. So if you’re trying to overcome depression, for example, you might give yourself +20 in determination for calling your doctor. The figure could also be +100 or +0.001 – the purpose is just to acknowledge and reward your accomplishment. Remember: playing SuperBetter is supposed to be fun! You deserve points when you play it well.  The key message in this book: Games are a lot more than just fun. They boost your confidence, strengthen your will and bring you closer to the people you play them with. SuperBetter can help you overcome major challenges if you play it right! So outline your adventure, identify your power-ups and bad guys and seek out allies to support and guide you. SuperBetter won’t just take you where you want to go; it’ll make the journey fun, too! Actionable advice: Get an avatar that looks like you! If you play a video game designed to boost your confidence, make your avatar looks like you. That reinforces the idea that the person playing the game is you, not some mythical creature. This will maximize the benefits of play!

This may be a tough concept to grasp, as for most of our lives, living to 80 was the upward limit for aging. But this is changing. Improved medicine and living conditions in many parts of the world have led scientists to believe that living past 100 years will soon become normal – that is, 100 is becoming the new 80. This will dramatically change how we live and particularly, how we spend our retirement years. These blinks offer a look at what living longer means practically and how you personally can get ready to rock a longer life with your centenarian friends. In these blinks, you’ll find out why living longer has serious consequences for pension plans; how new technology will change how we view work; and why you need to know the answers to the “big five questions.” Modern society is replete with examples of happy, healthy children. Yet historically, this wasn’t always the case. The jump in the world’s birth rate is a result of a dramatic rise in human life expectancy, sparked by advances in the treatment of disease common to different stages of life. Infancy is the first stage, and here medicine has made huge strides. Not so long ago, it was common for children to die before they reached adolescence. Thanks to improvements in vaccinations, general hygiene and other breakthroughs in medicine like the discovery of antibiotics, many deadly childhood diseases such as smallpox have been mostly eradicated. Society at large knows more about good nutrition and proper health care, too. All these elements taken together mean children live healthier, longer lives. A child born in 1914, for example, had a one percent chance of living to 100; a child born in 2014 has a 50 percent chance of living that long. Middle age is the second life stage, and here, many common diseases are now better understood and treated. In the second half of the twentieth century, for example, medical science was able to develop more sophisticated ways to diagnose and treat illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Around the same time, new research pointed to ways people could further improve health, while better education got the word out. Smoking was finally seen for the killer it is, which resulted in regulations over tobacco ads and aggressive public health campaigns addressing the risks of smoking. Today, science is examining the third life stage – old age. Breakthroughs here are certain to produce yet another increase in human life expectancy. Old-age diseases such as Alzheimer's affect both the quality and length of a patient’s life. Diligent research into diseases like this mean that we’re seeing results, and elderly people are indeed living longer, healthier lives as well. In 1950, for example, a 90-year-old man living in England had a 30 percent chance of dying within a year; today, that estimate is now 20 percent. Improved nutrition, advanced medical technology and better sanitation are all to thank for this extension of human life. You don’t need a doctorate in economics to know that the working world has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Your life at the office is no doubt very different from that of your parents’ generation. But how do such differences relate to increasing life expectancy? Your parents likely followed a straightforward, three-stage career, consisting of school, work and then a short period as a retiree. Members of this particular generation, or people born between the 1940s and 1960s and who finished school around the age of 20, could, in general, expect to retire comfortably. Let’s look at the example of Jack, who was born in 1945. He graduated from college at 20, entered the workforce during America’s Golden Age following World War II, and retired at the age of 62, after 42 years of employment. He then died a few years later, at the age of 70. Jack’s finances were solid, largely because he received a pension from his employer and social security from the government. Since he only lived for eight years after retiring and worked for more than 40 overall, for every retirement year, he was financed by five years of active work – a healthy foundation. But imagine if Jack had lived to be 100. With rising life expectancies, this isn’t unrealistic. With those extra years, the solidity of Jack’s original pension starts to fall apart, or disappear altogether. In short, living longer is making it harder for people to fully retire, as the former three-stage social model to fund retirement years is breaking down.   Here’s a modern example. Jane was born in 1998. Her life expectancy is around 100 years, about 30 years longer than Jack’s. If Jane retires at 65, she’ll have worked for 44 years – but will spend 35 years in retirement. Simply put, Jane’s savings accumulated during her work years won’t be able to support a long retirement. Jane has just over a year of active work to pay for each year of her retirement – a fifth of what Jack had. What’s more, since both government and private pensions are paying out less and less, Jane will need to put more and more of her income toward her retirement savings. It’s clear that increased life expectancy is starting to pose serious challenges for society. But as we’ll see in the next blink, working people are grappling with other issues, too. Your parents today may not even understand what it is that you do for a living – modern work has changed that much in a short time. And it certainly will continue to change as technology influences the workplace. Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are certainly changing work as we know it. While this technology is still young, we can expect its influence to grow, with the biggest changes yet to come. Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David Autor says jobs that involve routine tasks, whether manual or cognitive, soon will be performed by machines. At Amazon’s warehouses, for example, robots move most inventory. Tasks such as these can be automated, as they follow strict rules and don’t require a person to make decisions. In fact, it doesn’t matter how sophisticated a process is, as long as it follows a script. This could mean that shortly, robots could perform a complex but routine task such as a medical diagnosis. While intelligent machines may replace many humans in jobs soon, there still are tasks for which humans are essential. People can solve complex problems; we can also come up with new, innovative ideas. This second point is crucial, as it’s innovation that creates value. Apple’s iPhone, for example, is assembled by Chinese company Foxconn, at a manufacturing cost that is five to seven percent of the phone’s purchase price. Since Foxconn “makes” the iPhone, one might imagine that the company is responsible for creating all the value the product holds. But in reality, a Foxconn employee produces only $2,000 of value, since one person can assemble only so many units. An Apple employee, on the other hand, creates $640,000 of value – because Apple, not Foxconn, is responsible for the phone’s design, from which millions of units are sold. Humans also excel at tasks that involve interpersonal interaction – a basic yet important point, as after all, people tend to like to interact and talk to other people. In other words, while computers might be able to solve mathematical equations rapidly and accurately, they can’t yet compete with people in terms of personal touch, perception or mobility. Are you someone who spends every free minute at the gym, working out to stay healthy? If so, good for you. Taking care of yourself may be more important than you think. With life expectancy on the rise, staying healthy is all the more essential. For instance, let’s say you develop back pain at age 50, and you’re expected to live until 70. You’ll have to manage your back pain for some 20 years – already a long period. Now imagine that your life expectancy isn’t 70 but 100 years. How do you feel about 50 years of agony? So perhaps it’s time to get to the gym or visit a doctor! Interestingly, working out isn’t just good for addressing the issues of an aging body. Studies suggest that as we get older, lifestyle choices are responsible for 70 percent of our mental decline. This means that physical exercise can keep you in good mental shape, too. The same holds for eating plenty of fish and fresh produce, and performing mental training exercises. So now you know that caring for your physical body is important for your well-being, but did you know that being self-reflective is also important? Today, you mostly determine who you are, not your family tree or tradition. Self-reflection is crucial in this context, as it helps you recognize your strengths, weaknesses and values, and determines how you see yourself and the world. By taking time to understand yourself better, you can better reflect on important decisions and choose a path that’s best suited for you. In turn, this will help you deal with change more productively. Let’s say you’re dissatisfied with a job you’ve been at for years. Leaving might result in a lower income somewhere else and an uncertain future overall. But if you have a clear picture of your strengths and desires, you’ll find a job that’s a better fit. The world’s economy has changed significantly, offering many different working realities for each successive generation. While your parents may have found a job in their 20s that they stuck with until retirement, today your options as a working individual are much broader. Since young people today are no longer bound by the three traditional stages of schooling, work and retirement, there’s more room for exploration, which is important. Being an explorer can mean learning more about other countries, but it also means exploring your environment and finding your place in it. A longer life means the decisions you make early on can have a greater impact on the years to come. Thus it’s essential to explore all of your options, in work and life, and find the ones that are right for you. The best times to do this are between the ages of 18 and 30, again in your mid-40s and your 70s or 80s. These are the times when natural life transitions occur, and are therefore ripe for reflection.   Keep in mind that while each person’s exploration will be different, it’s not uncommon for this experience to ignite a desire to create more or to become someone who produces independently. Following a path like this can offer substantial freedom from a “normal” working life. When you work for an established company or build a start-up, your focus tends to be on money and other financial assets. But becoming an independent producer helps you focus on the process itself, whether you’re designing a product or launching a service. You could start a blog and create a product around it, like an online course, for example. The key is that this type of activity is about experimentation – failing and learning by doing. But it can also be a way to build up your credentials, especially if you’re just starting your career. It’s hard to think about retirement plans without thinking about money. While most people know that a comfortable retirement is built through smart accounting, it doesn’t mean that putting your finances in order is an easy process. In fact, planning for retirement is complex, as it’s hard to anticipate future prices or needs. Yet there are a few tricks to help you plan a path toward a stress-free retirement. First, you need to know what percentage of your salary will be sufficient for you to live on once you retire. Is 50 percent enough, or will you need more? To figure this out, think about what you spend money on now and how much you spend in total. Once you’re retired, costs like commuting will no longer exist, and other activities, like eating at restaurants, will reduce as you’ll have more time to cook. Other costs such as for prescription drugs or health care, however, could be higher. While better understanding your finances is important, you’ll also need to increase your financial literacy. The Big 5 Questions test will help you do this. Take a minute to jot down the answer to the questions: The first question is: Suppose you had $100 in savings with a two percent rate of annual interest. How much money would you have after five years? For the second question, imagine your interest rate is one percent and inflation is two percent. After one year, would you be able to buy more, less, or the same amount of goods? The third question is true or false: buying a single company’s stock is usually safer than investing in a mutual fund. And the fourth question is also true or false: a 15-year mortgage usually requires higher monthly payments than a 30-year mortgage, but the total interest over the life of the loan tends to be less. And the last question: If interest rates rise, what will happen to the price of bonds? Once you can answer these questions correctly, you’ll be a smarter saver and retirement planner. Here are the answers: Question one: Just over $110; Question two: Less; Question three: False; Question four: True; Question five: They’ll fall. When you meet someone at a party, it’s common to want to know all sorts of things about that person, from where they work to what music they like. Oddly enough, we show considerably less curiosity when we turn that same lens on ourselves. If you want to shape your life positively, it’s good to start with the question, “Who am I?” As human civilization has advanced, this question has become increasingly important. For most of history, life was short and dominated by basic struggles for food and shelter. Today such struggles for large parts of the world are less of an issue. Instead, we can expect to live longer and have a greater measure of security as we do. Because of this, we’re freer to shape our lives based on our sense of identity and held values. But before we can do this, we need to know who we are – which can be a real challenge. Historically, traditional gender roles and inherited family or social status would often shape a person’s identity. But society continues to change and evolve, and such pressures are no longer as relevant. Now many people can build a life that matches their individual values, wishes and ambitions. Whether your plans deal with finances, personal knowledge or social networks, it’s essential you come up with a particular trajectory that fits who you are. The modern world is pushing people to become more individualistic, making experimentation in daily life a crucial activity. The bottom line is that there are millions of things you can do with your life, and exploring different options is the only way to figure out what works for you and what doesn’t. So while living to 100 offers more freedom, it poses more challenges, too. Making your own choices and finding your true identity will help you build a life that makes the most out of your extra years in the world. The key message in this book: Living longer offers new opportunities for an individual, but increasing life expectancy overall poses challenges for society. As traditional roles fall by the wayside, the standard life trajectory of schooling, work and retirement is less relevant, while a need for self-knowledge and experimentation is growing.  Actionable advice: Build regenerative friendships. In contrast to your professional network, regenerative friendships support your well-being and vitality. You know such people in a variety of contexts, from family connections to spending time at the gym. Such a complexity of social situations adds depth to friendships, making them emotionally binding, and encouraging you to invest more time, energy and feeling into them. Got feedback?

Where do you start? How do you know which ones really work, so that you don’t end up buying into a fad and wasting your time? Thankfully, all the hard research is already done for you by the author, who tried out numerous diet plans and exercises, gathering information from his personal experience to come up with body hacks that you can easily implement in your daily life. Backed by evidence from a wealth of sources, such as medical practitioners and the world’s best athletes, these blinks provide you with some of the main techniques the author discovered for losing weight, gaining muscle, improving your sex life, sleeping better and boosting your athletic performance. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how to cheat sleep and be completely functional throughout the day; the secret to the female orgasm; and what you should eat if you want to lose weight. To become good at what you do, you need to dedicate yourself to the task. That’s why, for a decade, the author met with renowned athletes and scientists and offered himself up as a test subject for unconventional fitness methods to discover the most effective way to achieve a good body. What the author learned during those ten years was the importance of the Minimum Effective Dose (MED). This key concept was created by Arthur Jones, a leading specialist in exercise science. From his research, he identified the minimum amount of effort that would produce the desired outcome. In fact, anything more than the MED would have an unfavorable effect. Putting this theory into practice, Brian MacKenzie, a triathlete and Ironman competitor, changed his training schedule according to the MED method. Previously, he used to train 24 to 30 hours per week, which put a strain on his body as well as his personal relationships. With the MED approach, however, his training was minimized to 6.5 hours a week and consisted of strength training, CrossFit and pace work. As a result, MacKenzie placed fourth in the most intense race in the world, the Angeles Crest 100-Mile Endurance Run. His body had trained to become aerobic at maximum speed, which was more effective than the high-volume and low-speed training he used to do. However, before you can put the MED into practice, you need to first experience a Harajuku Moment. This refers to the instant when you realize that you need to do something. The term comes from Chad Fowler, CTO of information and technology company InfoEther and a friend of the author. While vacationing in Tokyo, Fowler ended up in Harajuku, hoping to do a bit of shopping. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find anything that he liked because he was overweight and told his friend, “For me, it doesn’t even matter what I wear; I’m not going to look good anyway.” It was at this moment when he was saying those words out loud, that Fowler had his Harajuku Moment. He asked himself why he was successful in every aspect of his life except for his health. After that realization, Fowler started to take more care about what he was eating and took up cardio training three to four times a week. A year after he had his Harajuku Moment, Fowler had managed to lose 32 kg. If you want to lose weight, there are a bunch of diets out there to try. But one that has been proven to work is the slow-carb diet. By using it, within 30 days, the author managed to drop 9 kg without exercising once. There are five rules to abide by in the slow-carb diet. The first rule is to stop eating white carbohydrates. That’s all types of bread, rice (including brown rice), potatoes, pasta, tortillas and cereal. Second, you need to keep eating the same meals. The supermarket may give you plenty of options for foodstuffs, but only a small portion of them won’t cause weight gain. So stick to these three categories: main proteins (eggs, beef, pork, chicken breast or thigh), legumes (black beans, red beans, soya beans, borlotti beans and lentils) and vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, asparagus, peas, green beans, sauerkraut and kimchi). The third rule is to avoid drinking calories in the form of milk (as well as soy milk), fruit juices and soft drinks. Instead, you can drink large quantities of water and unsweetened tea and coffee. One or two glasses of red wine per day are OK, but you should keep away from beer as it contains more calories. Fourth, don’t eat fruit, as many fruits contain fructose, which is a type of sugar. Tomatoes and avocados, however, are exceptions to this rule. And the final rule is to allow yourself a cheat day, where, once a week, you get to eat anything you want, even pizza or beer. This is because binge-eating once a week increases your metabolism and stimulates fat loss. For the slow-carb diet to work effectively, you also need to eat a protein-rich breakfast. Just consider the author’s father, who was also on a diet plan and was losing 7.7 kg of weight per month. However, when he started skipping breakfast, his weight loss rate fell to 2.5 kg per month. That’s because missing breakfast usually results in overeating in the evenings. Furthermore, including a minimum of 20 g of protein in your breakfast within the first hour of waking reduces cravings for carbs. Some proteins that you can have as the first meal of the day include eggs, cottage cheese, a protein shake or turkey bacon. Meet Tracy Reifkind. For most of her life, she has been overweight, and at 41 years of age, she weighed 111 kg. Tracy dreamt of visiting Italy, but her obesity kept her from fulfilling that wish. Then Tracy was introduced to the Russian kettlebell swing by her husband Mark Reifkind, a former powerlifting coach for the US national teams. The Russian kettlebell swing is the most effective way to lose fat rapidly and was created by Zar Horton, an ex-firefighter from the Albuquerque Fire Department. There are three steps involved in the Russian kettlebell swing. First, position yourself so that you’re holding the kettlebell between your legs. Then bend down, and when the kettlebell touches the floor, lift it up quickly. Repeat three sets of five deadlifts, making sure your head is always facing forward. For maximum effectiveness, it is important the kettlebell touches the exact same spot on the ground each time. Second, instead of putting the kettlebell on the floor between your feet, as in step one, this time swing it further back then forward again. With this variation, you will automatically work up a pendulum motion as you “touch and go.” Third, focus on swinging the kettlebell so far back so that it reaches behind your legs and up below your buttocks. Following these three steps, training twice per week in sessions of 15 to 20 minutes, Tracy lost more than 45.1 kg in weight and 20.4 kg of fat in just three months. For others, such as Neil Strauss, the author’s friend and the bestselling writer of The Game, losing weight wasn’t the problem, but rather gaining muscle. To try to solve this, Strauss began following the author’s own Occam’s Protocol method. The protocol involves many weightlifting exercises, including the overhead squat,  where you perform ten squats and lift a barbell at the same time. To do so, you need to position both feet slightly further apart than shoulder width and about a foot in front of your hips. Make sure you bend your knees to a 45-degree angle and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Incredibly, by switching back and forth between the Occam’s Protocol method and the Russian kettlebell swing, Strauss managed to gain 4.5 kg of muscle in just a month. According to sex researcher Shere Hite, more than two-thirds of American women fail to reach orgasm during intercourse. Furthermore, Alfred Kinsey, a sexologist, found that almost 50 percent of them couldn’t orgasm at all. However, by changing the angle and pressure of sex positions, women have a better chance of experiencing orgasms. Meet Nina Hartley. Hartley has starred in over 650 adult movies and is a well-known star in the industry. And then there’s Lexington Steele, the only male porn star to be awarded the Adult Video News Awards, considered “the Oscars of porn,” three times. Without hesitation, Steele stated that the best sex he’s ever had was with Hartley. Hartley has two suggestions for orgasmic sex. First, adjust the angle of penetration so that the tip of the penis touches the woman’s G-spot. Second, alter the pressure so that the man’s pelvic bone is in contact with the woman’s clitoris. So, in the missionary position, a pillow should be placed under the woman’s lower back to help elevate her hips, and then the man should keep his hips as close as possible to the woman’s hips by kneeling. For pressure, Hartley suggests that the man slowly moves his hips in small circular motions or side to side to make sure that his pelvic bone is hitting the clitoris. Another way to have better sex is to increase your libido by upping your testosterone or luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. LH is responsible for ovulation and is strongly linked to the female libido. To increase your testosterone or LH levels in the short-term, the same advice applies: you should eat at least 800 mg of cholesterol (four hard-boiled eggs, for example) a few hours before bed, one night before you want to have sex. This is because both testosterone and LH are made from cholesterol, which is produced most efficiently during the night. Do you ever find yourself in bed trying to sleep when your brain just won’t switch off? You try counting sheep, switching positions, turning on the TV and other tactics, and before you know it, it’s four in the morning, and you’re still wide awake. If this sounds familiar, you – just like the author and many others around the world – might have insomnia. To help you fall asleep, try taking a cold bath one hour before you go to bed. In 2002, during the author’s sleep biology class at Stanford, the professor remarked that the cold was very effective at triggering sleep. Specifically, his suggestion was to fill a bathtub with two to three bags of ice and then sit in it for ten minutes an hour prior to sleeping. This was the one technique that helped with the author’s insomnia. The next piece of advice is to aim for two hours of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep daily rather than the classic eight hours of shut-eye. REM is the most important stage in the sleep cycle for memory and regulating emotions, and you can trick your body into entering the REM phase more quickly by making it believe it won’t get enough sleep. You can perform this REM hack with the Everyman method, which allows you to feel fresh and awake on only 5.2 hours of sleep each day by having one core sleep of 4.5 hours and two further 20-minute naps. Alternatively, you can use the Uberman method, which instructs you to take 20-minute naps, once every four hours, six times a day. It’s important not to go over the designated 20 minutes, just as it’s important not to miss a nap by more than 30 minutes because that could mean a few days are needed to get back on track. The hardest part will be the first two weeks, as your body starts to get used to a new sleeping pattern. But when you master this technique, you’ll be functioning on only two hours of sleep per day instead of eight – just imagine all the reading you can do with all that extra time! Each year, more than 300 of the best college footballers undergo physical examinations that include a vertical jump and a 37-metre run in front of NFL coaches and talent scouts. An inch or a fifth of a second could be the difference between getting – or losing – an offer from a football team. For this reason, many aspiring football players are hoping to be trained by Joe DeFranco, an expert who can increase an athlete’s vertical jump in only two days. After being trained by DeFranco, the author increased his vertical jump by three inches. He managed to achieve this by learning the following: start his jump holding his arms over his head, just like an Olympic diver. Because the shoulders contribute almost 20 percent of the jump height, it’s important to use your upper-body strength to swing your arms down as fast as possible. The faster you pull yourself into a half-squat, the higher your jump. Additionally, it’s vital to avoid getting into a wide squat as this can reduce your jump by one to two inches. But to be good enough to receive an offer from an NFL team requires more than just a good vertical jump; another key criterion is that you be able to run properly, which you can learn with the Pose method. The technique was created by Nicolas S. Romanov as he was completing his PhD in physical education at the Russian Academy of Physical Culture and Sports. In 2005, Romanov posted a video of himself running on ice, and it went viral. The reason was that the technique he used for running on the ice is also the most effective way to run on dry ground: Build speed by using gravity and leaning forward instead of being fully dependent on muscular exertion. Make contact with the ground using the balls of your feet. Keep your knees slightly bent at all times instead of straightening them. Rather than push off with your feet, move your effort toward your buttocks. Try to hit a stride rate of a minimum 90 steps per minute per leg. Allyson Felix, a 17-year-old student, broke her high school’s 200m sprint record, after which she started training with world-renowned coach Barry Ross. Following a year of training under Ross, in 2003, Felix broke the 200m world record. One of Ross’ main training techniques is what’s known as Competition Conditioning, which stems from a study called “Energetics of High-Speed Running: Integrating Classical Theory and Contemporary Observations.” The training is very simple: the objective is to be able to walk a distance of 100 meters in under 23.8 seconds. To reach this goal, three times a week, Felix trained to walk as fast as she could for 15 minutes so that she first walked in one direction for 7.5 minutes and then had to make it back within the next 7.5 minutes. With each session, Felix pushed to walk further in this timeframe. After practicing this method for a month, Felix could walk 100 meters in under 23.8 seconds, indicating that she had achieved baseline conditioning for competing. The effectiveness of this training technique stems from the walker’s strong feeling that the movement is inefficient and the resulting desire to jog. However, running speed isn’t the only athletic skill that can be improved in a short amount of time. The author managed to double the distance he could swim with the same number of strokes using the Total Immersion technique. The technique was taught to him by American swim coach, Terry Laughlin, and its main points are as follows: Focus on turning your body when you breathe in instead of relying on pulling with your arms or kicking your legs – this will help you push forward with minimal effort. Look straight down to ensure that your body is in a horizontal position at all times. Cut through the water with your hands facing downward and extend your arm fully so that it goes beyond your head. Aim to increase your stroke length rather than your stroke rate. Reduce the number of strokes per lap by using the momentum of each downstroke to propel you as far as possible. Stretch the arm that’s underwater and turn your body completely to the side when taking a breath. You’ll know that you’ve stretched it far enough when you feel it in your lower side as if you were reaching for an item from a shelf. With techniques like these, you can attain results faster than you ever dreamed possible. The key message in these blinks: To lose weight and gain muscle, follow the Minimum Effective Dose method and avoid eating white carbohydrates, like rice, pasta and bread. Train yourself to get by on just two hours of REM sleep to maximize the time for other pursuits. And finally, learn to run faster and swim further with Competition Conditioning and the Total Immersion technique. Actionable advice: Add one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon to your diet daily. Cinnamon can make you feel fuller, faster by reducing your glycaemic levels by 29 percent. Your glycaemic levels reflect the amount of carbohydrates found in the food, and they determine the impact these carbs have on your blood sugar level. To help you lose weight, consume one and a half teaspoons of freshly ground cinnamon – preferably Saigon cinnamon - each day. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Creativity is a part of everyone’s life, whether you’re a globe-trotting rock star or simply someone who enjoys a spot of watercolor painting on a Sunday afternoon. Exploring your creativity can be incredibly fulfilling. However, pressures across different areas of your life – particularly in the workplace – can make it difficult to maintain that creativity. These blinks will help you battle these pressures and unleash your creative potential. You’ll learn how to ensure you’re never short on creativity again. You’ll also discover how to prove to your boss that you’re a valuable employee; why keeping FRESH will help your creativity; and how the saying “you are what you eat” applies in a creative context. Creativity is a highly valued skill. Indeed, it’s becoming increasingly necessary in more and more jobs. However, unlike traditional workplace skills, creativity fluctuates, and this can make it incredibly difficult for employees to deliver when their employer expects them to deliver the creative goods. To prove to your boss that you’re a viable creative asset, you need to be prolific, brilliant and healthy. Unfortunately, most of us are deficient in at least one of these areas, and because of that our work and reputation suffers. Maybe you’re prolific and brilliant, but you have an unhealthy approach to work that puts you at risk of overexertion and burnout. Or maybe you’re both brilliant and healthy but aren’t being prolific, which results in nobody wanting to work with you because you’re not pulling your weight. Or maybe you’re healthy and prolific but not brilliant, which puts you at risk of losing your job since an absence of quality in your work is irredeemable. Another pressure of the modern workplace is that employees must be creative and innovative, while at the same time consistently meeting deadlines. This expectation shows that most companies are more concerned with results than with the creative processes of individual employees. For example, a client of the author, preoccupied with whether her managers would approve her work, found herself ignoring her creative impulses and playing it safe instead. A CEO told the author that he calls this tactic bunting for singles; just as in baseball, it’s safer to go for smaller “bases” at work than risk a strikeout by going for the bigger home runs. Furthermore, companies also tend to focus more on predictable outcomes and less on giving room for irregular waves of creativity, a tendency that takes a toll on innovative thinking. A friend of the author said that the creative types at his company refer to the decision-makers as “vampires” because they suck all the life from the room. As you can see, managerial expectations are often at odds with the needs of employees when it comes to creativity. Often, we aren’t aware when our creative process is under threat. If we learn to recognize the warning signs, however, we’ll be better able to combat the three pesky “assassins” that try to sneak in and kill our creativity. The first assassin we must arm ourselves against is dissonance, which usually arises when a company’s purpose for action – “the why” of the company – is not aligned with the actions it takes – the company’s “what.” Here’s an example of dissonance: The author once worked with a design firm whose creative leaders didn’t clearly express the expectations of the clients to the designers. Instead of a brief detailing the concepts underlying the client‘s requests, the designers were given vague cosmetic requests. This caused the work to suffer. When there’s no “why” behind a particular “what,” the result is usually confusion and misunderstanding. The second assassin is fear, and it usually pops up when we’re imagining the possible outcomes of an idea. A particular experiment demonstrates this well. People were first asked to imagine walking along a twenty-foot plank on the floor, and most of them were confident they could do it without falling off. They were then asked to imagine walking along the same plank, but this time with it suspended between two buildings 100 feet above ground – and most of them didn’t believe they could do it. In short, when the potential outcome of a particular action became frightening, people were less likely to think they could succeed. Similarly, many people are dissuaded from undertaking a creative venture because they fear what might happen. The third and final assassin is expectation escalation, and it refers to the inflation of expectations, which often puts a damper on creativity. When you fixate on the outcome of a project, you may fail to see different possibilities. The higher your expectations, the more you become consumed with realizing them, letting everything else fall by the wayside. Now that we’re familiar with some potential creativity killers, we can move on to practices that’ll keep us engaged. The best way to do this is to stay FRESH – by attending to our focus, relationships, energy, stimuli and hours. Let’s begin with focus. A lack of focus comes from two key factors: unhealthy assumptions and the ping. According to neuroscientist Jeff Hawkins, unhealthy assumptions arise because our brains are constantly predicting what will happen based on our previous experiences. Though these assumptions are usually helpful, they can also be faulty. For example, the author once found a spider in the garden shed he used as a home office. After that, he started spending one minute every morning checking for spiders. That’s a total of six wasted hours every year – all because of something that happened once! The second focuser destroyer, the ping, is the sudden and uncontrollable urge to divert your focus and respond to a new email or text message. In order to fight the ping and unhealthy assumptions, you must do three things: define and refine your work and cluster your tasks. To define your work, the author suggests assigning four to six “challenges” to any task. The challenges can be anything, such as, “How can we make our brand stand out from the crowd?” or “How can we lower costs?” When you address these questions specifically, it’s easier to see where you should be directing your focus. The next step is to refine your work using The Big Three. Identify the three projects that are most in need of critical attention; this will inevitably guide your focus to these tasks. The final step is to cluster similar tasks, such as meetings or project planning, and spend a minimum of 30 minutes working on each cluster. This exercise is similar to the retail practice of intelligent adjacency, whereby you place related products next to each other, like toothbrushes and toothpaste, increasing the chance of someone buying both at the same time. Following these steps will have you managing your focus in no time. Next, we’ll learn exactly where you should be focusing your newfound attention, starting with relationships. Creatives are usually introverted, since most of the time their work needs to be completed alone. But this doesn’t mean creatives don’t like being around people; it simply means that they usually derive their energy from themselves rather than from others. Inevitably, introversion and isolation limit one’s outlook and thus one’s creativity, but this can be counteracted by the next part of FRESH: relationships. Author Steven Johnson says that the best ideas of all time were sparked by people sharing and collaborating. The more minds that are present, the more creative avenues will open up. In the same vein, professor Louis Cozolino said that we need perspectives from other people to keep our creativity fresh. To build strong relationships, there are three main strategies: start a circle, head to heads and establishing a core team. First, you must regularly gather creatives of your choice in an informal circle. These can be friends or coworkers or both. Take turns discussing your current projects, what’s inspiring you and what you would like advice on. Sharing your insights will be mutually beneficial. The next step is to construct one-on-one meetings with other creatives, preferably with those who work in the same area as you. The aim of these meetings is to promote a healthy dose of competition between you and your partner that will push you both to be bold and innovative. The author sums this up with a quote by TV personality Diane Sawyer: “Competition is easier to accept if you realize it is not an act of oppression or abrasion,” but rather a challenge to help us grow. Finally, the core team requires a long-term student-and-master relationship. Seek the advice and counsel of two or three professionals whom you look up to – people outside your company and from different industries and positions. This will broaden your perspective and encourage learning. Following these strategies will help you grow your network and build strong and healthy relationships. Next on our FRESH list – energy. Though one of the most important of the five key areas, effective energy management is often neglected. Though the brain is only about 2 percent of our total body weight, it uses about 20 percent of available energy. Therefore, if we’re tired, and low on energy, we won’t be able to function properly. But refilling your energy tanks isn’t that straightforward; people wrongly assume that energy is a bottomless resource and that you simply need time to refill it. Author Tony Schwartz says that if we practice good time and resource management but neglect our energy levels, our productivity will suffer. He adds that we’re most productive when switching “between periods of high focus and intermittent rest.” So, to effectively manage your energy, you need to first manage your whole life, which should be done in weekly, monthly and quarterly segments. During the week, try to balance out energy-consuming tasks, such as long phone calls, with buffers, such as listening to five minutes of music. Buffers can also be handy during the transition from work to personal life. You could, for instance, stop by a bookstore on your way home. Each month you should take note of where your focus is needed. If you have a new project coming up, for example, you will need to readjust your personal commitments, and vice versa. Quarterly, you can look at your patterns and priorities as a whole. Do you have some birthdays coming up, or perhaps an anniversary? When is the best time to start that big project that’s been looming in the background? The final step in managing your energy is to “prune” away the less effective activities in your life. In vineyards, vine keepers are always pruning new growth to ensure that the older, fruit-bearing parts receive the necessary nutrients. This same cutting back process is applicable to energy management. Every month, identify the least effective and most energy draining activity in your life, and then eliminate it. When you’re able to effectively manage your energy, you can be sure that your time will be used to its full potential. Once you master that, you can move on and see how to curate what you consume: stimuli. We’ve all heard the saying, “You are what you eat,” but did you know that this can also be applied to creativity improvement? To maintain a healthy creative output, you need to make sure you receive a healthy intake of challenging, relevant and diverse stimuli – which is what the S in FRESH stands for. Sure, pop culture is a good source for trends, but to expand your worldview and get creative, you need to look to academia and other more complex sources. You also need to ensure that the sources are relevant – not only to specific projects and goals, but to the overall, long-term skills you wish to develop. One good daily practice is to seek out resources that encourage personal growth – such as, say, classes that teach a specific skill – and professional growth, such as trade magazines. Remember to vary the stimuli you consume. Consider topics and opinions you normally wouldn’t, and remember that breakthroughs usually come from unexpected places! A good example is Larry Keller of the advertising agency FKM, who came up with the idea of a steak restaurant as a fine-dining experience while on an art museum excursion. To help you manage your challenging, relevant and diverse stimuli, there are three things you should do: cultivate, process and experience. Make a quarterly study plan and allocate 25 percent to areas where you lack information needed for your job; 25 percent to what will benefit you in a wider sense, like educational blind spots and deficiencies; and 50 percent to things you’re curious about, like history or gardening, focusing on your passions, not your obligations. Then take notes on your insights, review them and see if a pattern emerges. You can do what Founding Father John Adams did and fill in the margins of books with your notes, as if reading was a conversation and not a monologue. But keep in mind that, though it’s great to study and take notes, you should get out there and experience the world. Go to museums and lectures, take walks – it all adds to your creativity! And now we’ve reached the final key to staying creative – managing your hours. The final area of FRESH, your hours – that is, time – is the most significant pressure point for many people because it is the most tangible resource. Look at your time like a portfolio, not a slot machine; aim for quality over quantity. Time management guides are usually only concerned with you getting through your work. This resolve bears resemblance to playing the slot machine, where you pull the lever over and over again in the hopes of a win that may never come. But that doesn’t work if you’re a creative. What you need instead is something that enhances your routine in the long term. This is known as the portfolio investment, and there are two main steps to it. The first step is to establish your idea. Most people, when they hear the word “brainstorming,” think of a group activity. However, this mental exercise also works just as well solo. Note that at this stage we are neither considering current designs nor concerned with execution; right now, it’s only about coming up with new ideas. To start off, try giving yourself one hour per week to conceptualize new ideas. Look back at your Big Three for inspiration, and define your problems as challenges, as we did earlier. Make sure you keep a record of everything that happens in each brainstorming session. The second step is to practice unnecessary creating, which refers to creating for the sake of creating, and not out of obligation to anyone else. It will get your brain in motion and actually clear your head, allowing you to be more productive in other areas. For example, a creative director named Robert told the author of the stresses and pressures of working for a large brand-design firm. The author recommended that Robert rediscover his old hobby of watercolor painting. In the following weeks, Robert regained his enthusiasm for work, all because he started doing something for himself. You may feel like you don’t have time for fun activities anymore, but take the author’s advice and try to incorporate them into your routine. You’ll be sure to see the benefits. The key message in this book: By incorporating these practices into your life, you’ll release your creative capacity naturally and easily, rather than struggling to hang onto it under the pressures of the workplace. To optimize our creativity, we need to keep FRESH and attend to our focus, relationships, energy, stimuli and hours. Aim for long-term development, not short-term outcomes, and stick to the goals you set for yourself! Actionable advice: Start today! Whatever it is that you wish to achieve, make sure that you give it all you’ve got each and every day. If you don’t, you’ll regret it in the end. A friend of the author once said that cemeteries are the most valuable land on the planet, as they are filled with unquantifiable amounts of unrealized potential and ideas. If you employ the practices outlined in these blinks and strive to consistently maximize your potential, you can be sure to “die empty.” Got feedback?

You’re probably pretty good at assessing your own abilities, too. Unfortunately, this is pretty unlikely! But don’t worry, you’re in good company: we are all far less rational and far more capricious in our decision-making than we believe ourselves to be. Like it or not, our brains are a mishmash of shortcuts and rules-of-thumb that helped our ancient ancestors avoid becoming lion lunch and stay alive long enough to pass on these traits to posterity. These days, however, these shortcuts lead to many fallacies and biases that hurt us more than they help us. These blinks will explain some of the main traps you probably fall into every single day, and along the way will provide you with tips on how to steer your way around them and start thinking clearly. You’ll learn why you should never bring your most beautiful friend along to a club if you’re trying to get lucky. You’ll also discover why 84 percent of Frenchmen erroneously believe they are above-average lovers, as well as how a little sunshine (or lack thereof) can lead to booms and busts in the stock market. And finally, you’ll find out that you might not want to trust yourself to spot a gorilla, even if it’s standing right in front of you! Do you feel that you have a pretty realistic grasp of your abilities? That, while others might delude themselves into overestimating their abilities, you don’t? If so, you aren’t alone: we all tend to view ourselves through rose-tinted glasses. Research has shown that we are overconfident in many areas of life. For example, studies have shown that 84 percent of Frenchmen consider themselves to be above-average lovers. In reality, it’s only possible for 50 percent to be considered “above average,” since, statistically speaking, 50 percent should rank higher and the other half should rank lower. Similarly, research has shown that 93 percent of US students ranked themselves as “above-average” drivers, and 68 percent of University of Nebraska faculty ranked their own teaching abilities in the top quartile. These numbers show that the majority of us rate our abilities higher than they probably are. Not only that, but we also mistakenly attribute successes to our own abilities and failures to external factors. Researchers even tested this by having a group of subjects take a personality test, and then assigning arbitrary scores to the tests. When the subjects were later interviewed, they found that those with “good” scores believed that the test results had fairly reflected their true abilities, thus successfully assessing their great personalities. Those who received “bad” scores, however, found the ratings to be useless, and that the test itself ‒ and not their personality ‒ was garbage. Have you ever had a similar experience? If you got an A on a high school exam, for example, you probably felt that you were responsible for your success. If you flunked, you probably thought that it wasn’t your fault, and that the test was unfair, or some other circumstance caused your failure. Knowing this, you should therefore be aware of our tendency to overestimate our knowledge and attribute all our success to our own skills. A good way to overcome this might be to invite an honest friend out to coffee and ask for their candid opinion on your strengths and weaknesses. Have you ever thought about why people at casinos throw their dice harder if they want a high number, and gently if they need a low one to win big? These gamblers are suffering from the illusion of control – i.e., the belief that we can influence things that we in fact cannot control. The illusion of control offers us hope: if we believe that we can exert some kind of control over our situation, then we can better endure life’s many sufferings. This was demonstrated in one study in which subjects were placed in booths to test their acoustic sensitivity to pain. Amazingly, they could withstand significantly more noise if the booth was equipped with a red “panic” button. The button, however, had literally no function. Participants simply had the illusion that they were in control of the situation, and were thus able to endure more pain. So it would make sense that “placebo buttons” are installed in all sorts of areas in order to create an illusory but ultimately useful sense of control. For example: those buttons you press at the crosswalk at a busy intersection? Most do nothing more than simply give us the feeling that we are influencing our situation – making it easier for us to wait for the light to change. The same is true for some “door-open” and “door-close” buttons in elevators, which often aren’t even connected to the electrical panel! Furthermore, in addition to having much less influence than we think, we are also quite overconfident about our ability to make predictions. Consider, for example, this ten-year study that evaluated 28,361 predictions from 284 self-described professionals across a number of fields, such as economics. These “expert” predictions were only marginally better than the predictions made by a random forecast generator. It’s therefore in your best interest to be critical of predictions and to focus your energy on a few things of importance that you truly can influence. When a soloist at a concert puts on a particularly riveting performance, it’s not uncommon for someone in the audience to spontaneously burst into applause. Suddenly everyone else joins the chorus – including you! But why? This is due to a phenomenon called social proof, which makes us feel like our behavior is correct when it matches other people’s. In fact, social proof is rooted in the genes of our ancestors, who copied others’ behavior to ensure their own survival. Imagine, for example, that you’re traveling with your hunter-gatherer friends, and they all suddenly started sprinting. If you decided to act individually by staying put and pondering whether the creature staring at you is really a lion, then you’ll end up being lion lunch, and thus exit the gene pool. If, however, you follow your group without hesitation, then you’ll have a better chance of surviving another day. And since following others was a good survival strategy for our ancestors, it is still deeply rooted in us today. One consequence of this “herd instinct” is that the more people follow an idea, the better we believe that idea to be. We see examples of this everywhere: from fashion and diets to stock market panic and collective suicides. Moreover, we don’t just do the same things as the group; we also change our opinions in order to stay part of the group. This kind of social proof is called groupthink. You can see it at work, for instance, whenever we bite our tongue in a meeting because we don’t want to be the naysayer who points out flaws in the commonly accepted reasoning and disrupts group unity. A perfect example of this was the demise of the world-class carrier Swissair: they had built a strong consensus about their success that suppressed even rational reservations, and they therefore missed the warning signs of the imminent financial danger that ultimately led to their demise. Do you consider yourself a good judge of character, whose first impressions of people often prove true later? Many people think this way about themselves, but in fact, it's likely that they are just the victims of confirmation bias. In actuality, we all suffer from confirmation bias, i.e., the tendency to interpret new information in such a fashion that our previous conclusions remain intact. Indeed, it is so common that it is even said to be “the mother of all misconceptions.” One example of confirmation bias in action is when we peruse our favorite news sites and blogs on the internet for analysis of recent events, forgetting, however, that our favorite sites mirror our own values. In doing this, we inevitably find communities of like-minded people, thus further entrenching our convictions. In addition, confirmation bias causes us to accept external information about ourselves that matches our existing self-image, and then unconsciously filter out everything else. This bias is the reason people believe that pseudosciences such as astrology and tarot-card reading work so well: we can’t help but see the many applications to our own lives in their universal descriptions. To explore this phenomenon, the psychologist Bertram Forer crafted fake personality readings from a mishmash of different astrology columns from various magazines, and then gave them to his students under the pretence that they were individual, personalized assessments. Afterwards the students were asked to rate these “personalized” descriptions, and on average judged them to be 86 percent accurate! This study indicated that we interpret information so it corresponds to our pre-existing self-image, and has since been aptly named the Forer effect. Knowing that we are unconsciously influenced by our confirmation bias, we should instead set out to find contrary opinions and evidence in order to form more balanced convictions. Have you ever gone to a club with a much more attractive friend, looking to meet someone but instead striking out all evening? Why is this? Quite simply: your friend makes people find you less attractive than you actually are. As it turns out, we are not very good at making absolute judgments, relying instead on comparisons. This is exemplified by the classic experiment involving only two buckets of water: one filled with lukewarm and the other with ice water. If you first place one hand in the cold water, and then place both hands in the lukewarm water, then the lukewarm water will feel extremely hot to the hand that was in the iced water. This is the contrast-effect at work, and it’s the reason why you appear far less attractive than you truly are when standing next to your ultra-attractive friend. The contrast-effect is also the reason discounts in business are successful. For example, we perceive a product that has been reduced from $100 to $70 to be better value than one that has always cost $70, even though the starting price plays no role in a product’s actual value. Yet another instance in which we misjudge something’s value occurs when we perceive scarcity. This phenomenon has been verified in one test involving cookies. In the experiment, subjects were divided into two groups: in one, each person received an entire box of cookies, and in the other, a mere two cookies. They then rated the cookies. The subjects that had received only two rated them much more highly than the other group. Businesses also take advantage of this lapse in our judgment by creating the feeling of scarcity, using phrases such as “today only” or “only while supplies last” in order to drive sales. Luckily, we can circumvent these comparison and scarcity biases by assessing something’s value based solely on its costs and benefits. By doing so, you’ll make much better choices. Do you find it difficult to remember the five items on the shopping list you composed only ten minutes ago, yet have no trouble at all remembering the intricate details of the plot of the movie you saw last week? This is because we need information to form meaningful stories before it makes sense to us; conversely, we are repelled by abstract details. We find this phenomenon strongly reflected in the media, where relevant facts take a back seat to entertaining narratives. For example, if a car drives over a bridge that suddenly collapses, we’ll probably hear much more about the unlucky driver than about the mundane details of the bridge’s faulty construction. Juicy facts about the person attract more readers than abstract information about how the accident could have been prevented, and media outlets reflect this in their reporting. In addition, we love exotic – and therefore exciting – stories. In fact, we are far more likely to believe exotic explanations to mundane ones, even though mundane explanations are more probable. As an example, reflect on this headline for a moment: “A young man is stabbed and fatally injured.” In your estimation, is the attacker more likely to be a middle-class American or a Russian immigrant who illegally imports combat knives? Most people would place their bet on the latter, but this assessment contradicts the fact that there are a million times more middle-class Americans than Russian knife smugglers, and thus the overall probability of the perpetrator being American is far higher. Unfortunately, we are simply so attracted to enticing descriptions that we often overlook more probable explanations for the story. This thinking error can be fatal in the medical field. For this reason, doctors are taught not to be seduced into thinking that symptoms might be caused by some exotic disease, and instead always investigate the most likely ailments first. They follow the motto: “When you hear hoofbeats, don’t expect a zebra.” Even if a zebra would be far more exciting than a mere horse. If something strange was happening right in front of you, like a gorilla running around, you’d notice, right? In fact, you probably wouldn’t if you were focusing on something else. It turns out that our focus is very narrow, and we miss everything that occurs outside it. Consider, for example, a Harvard study that demonstrated this illusion of attention: subjects watched a video of students passing basketballs back and forth, and were asked to count how many times the players in white T-shirts passed the ball. At the end, the subjects were asked if anything unusual caught their attention. Half the viewers shook their heads, totally unaware that in the middle of the video someone dressed as a gorilla had walked into the room, pounded his chest, and then disappeared. This is the reason we should never use cellphones while driving. Studies show that drivers’ attention is too overstretched to react to danger – just as slow, in fact, as when under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In addition, what we focus on is influenced by outside factors: when presented with a long stream of information, we pay much more attention to the information that comes first or last at the expense of everything in the middle. Consider this question: Who would you rather be stuck in an elevator with? Allan, who is smart, ambitious, good looking, critical and jealous? Or Ben, who is jealous, critical, good looking, ambitious and smart? Most people choose Allan. Even though the descriptions are identical, we are fooled by the primacy effect, which causes us to focus on first impressions that then shape our overall assessments. However, if our impressions were formed in the past, then the recency effect controls our attention: the more recently we received the information, the better we are at remembering it. For example, if you listened to a speech a few weeks ago, then you’ll remember the final point better than either your first impression or the content sandwiched between. In today’s world we face limitless choices about products and lifestyle. Be it finding the right wine or the best university, you are bombarded with options. For most people it’s difficult or even impossible to manage this cornucopia. Indeed, a large selection leads to an inability to come to a decision, and we often just give up instead. This paradox of choice was tested in one supermarket where researchers set up a stand with different jelly samples for people to try and then buy at a discount. The experiment was conducted over two days, with 24 varieties of jelly on the first day, and only six on the second. The results showed that they sold ten times more jelly on day two, indicating that too much choice inhibited customers’ ability to make a decision and that they thus opted to not buy anything. A similar study on decisions made when picking out potential partners on online dating sites even showed that the stress of being presented with an overwhelming variety of potential partners causes the male brain to reduce the decision to a single criterion: physical attractiveness. Furthermore, research has shown that decision-making can also be exhausting, resulting in decision fatigue. This was tested by one psychologist who presented two groups with pairs of items; one group had to deliberate over which they preferred, while the other group simply wrote down what they thought about the items. Immediately thereafter, they put their hand in ice-cold water for as long as possible. The first group could keep their hand submerged in the water for a much shorter amount of time than the second, thus indicating that their willpower was exhausted by this intensive decision-making. So in order to circumvent these traps in decision-making, you should realize that the “perfect decision” is impossible, and instead learn to love a “good” choice, rather than striving for the “best” choice. How many beautiful, smiling faces do you see plastered on billboards on a daily basis? It’s no mistake: businesses know that we are all susceptible to good looks and charm. In fact, a single quality – whether beauty, social status, age, etc. – produces in us a positive or negative impression that outshines everything else. This is called the halo effect. Beauty’s disproportionate effect on how we judge others has been studied more closely than any of these competing qualities. In fact, there is a scientific consensus that we automatically regard good-looking people as more pleasant, honest and intelligent. This effect has been identified in both schools and workplaces: attractive people enjoy easier professional lives, and teachers even unconsciously award good-looking students better grades. While the halo effect is great for advertisers, it can also lead to stereotyping when nationality, gender, or race becomes the single feature that we focus on. And it’s not only racists and sexists who fall victim to this; we all use easily identifiable details to formulate our opinions. For example, if the new CEO of your company is an attractive female, you might immediately use this information to assess how she got her job without looking at the other possible factors. You might think that it was her looks that landed her the post and not her outstanding education and experience in leadership. In addition, we generally fall prey to the liking bias – i.e., liking people when they are similar to us and if they like us. This is one reason why salespeople flatter potential customers. Receiving compliments, such as “you look amazing in that dress!” makes us far more inclined to want to buy from that person, because they make us feel liked and happy. Another technique salespeople use is “mirroring,” or copying the gestures, facial expressions and language of the client. This makes the seller appear more similar to the client, thus more likeable and more likely to close the deal. Would you consider yourself to be rational decision maker? Try this exercise, and see: decide right now whether or not you are in favor of genetically modified food. How did you come to your decision? A truly rational approach would be to separately consider both the advantages and disadvantages of genetically modified foods: first, assess each “pro” in terms of importance, and then multiply each by the probability that those advantages will actually occur. Then, do the same with each “con.” Voilà! The sum of the pros minus the sum of the cons is your answer: if the value is greater than zero, then there are more pros, and thus you have a favorable view of genetically modified food. But, if you are like most people, you have neither the time nor the energy to make these kinds of meticulous assessments. In other words, we are not ultra-rational in our decision-making! On the contrary, our decisions are rarely rational and thought out; rather, we rely on mental shortcuts guided by our emotions to make decisions. For example, when we hear the words “genetically modified,” positive or negative emotional reactions are triggered, which affect how we assess the concept’s risks and benefits. So if your initial judgment is that the concept is appalling, then you will probably judge the risks (e.g., environmental hazards) as being greater and the benefits (e.g., pest resistance) as being smaller than they might actually be. In this way, our decisions are limited to what springs into our minds first. And as puppets to our feelings we are prevented from making rational decisions, which can be problematic in areas where rationality is highly valued. Even the markets aren’t untouched by emotional influence. In fact, one study found that daily market performance in 26 major stock exchanges was influenced by the amount of morning sun: when the sun shone first thing, the stock market rose during the day, thus indicating that the positive emotions triggered by sunshine influenced the flow of billions of dollars. The key message in this book: We think we are better than we actually are and we automatically seek out information that confirms us in our pre-existing beliefs. We also have a preference for the exotic, beautiful people and a small rather than a large selection of things. We notice only a limited amount of the things in front of us, and don’t know how to make absolute judgments. And our decisions are guided by our emotions and by the way that people around us are behaving. Actionable advice: Get an honest opinion about yourself. Whether you like it or not, you overestimate your abilities just like everyone else. A good way to combat this tendency is to ask your friend (or even better: your enemy) over for coffee and ask for their honest opinion about your strengths and weaknesses. Don’t be fooled by “limited time only”. These kinds of sales pitches play on your tendency to value things more when their availability is decreasing. Instead, remind yourself that, in this day and age, virtually anything can be found online. This will help you focus on the actual benefits the product provides, rather than the possibility that it will disappear forever.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

We look at ourselves and see intelligent, prudent individuals, whose actions are entirely congruent with our beliefs. Wouldn’t that be nice! The reality is that we are highly complicated – and contradictory. Our decision making isn’t based on cold, factual analysis, but instead on a myriad of fickle, irrational emotions and subconscious mechanisms. All of our decisions, from the cars we buy to the careers we choose, are products of a long line of influences over which we often have absolutely no power. In these blinks, you’ll learn all about these influences, how they affect you and what you can do to become a better decision maker. After reading these blinks, you’ll know why you might not notice the huge, hairy gorilla in the room; how resisting one delicious marshmallow can indicate greater success in life; and what love at first sight has in common with the fear of falling. How exactly do we make decisions? Most of us would like to think that we weigh alternatives and arrive at rational, well-thought-out conclusions. However, the reality is far more complicated. To study choice, researchers had children sit at a table with a tasty marshmallow positioned in front of them. They told the kids: “You can have one marshmallow right now. But if you wait until I come back, you can have two.” For the kids who decided to eat the marshmallow immediately, their automatic system, which subconsciously and continuously analyzes sensory data to produce automatic reactions, was predominant. When these kids smelled the marshmallow – i.e., experienced sensory stimulus – they responded with an automatic reaction, grabbing the marshmallow and greedily eating it. Choices dictated by the automatic system happen so fast that people find themselves acting even before they have an opportunity to consciously consider them. While it won’t help you abstain from eating marshmallows, we should thank the automatic system for enabling us to make quick decisions in the face of danger, e.g., jumping away from a moving car. Some kids in the experiment, however, elected not to eat the marshmallow immediately. For them, the reflective system, driven by reason and logic, was predominant. The reflective system allows us to consider the future consequences of our choices and factor them into our decision making. In the marshmallow experiment, 30 percent of the children chose to resist the marshmallow temptation for an entire 15 minutes, at which point they were rewarded with the second marshmallow. Interestingly, when the researchers did follow-up studies on these kids as adults, they discovered that those who had chosen to wait for their second marshmallow as children developed stronger friendships and were healthier and more successful, both academically and financially. So, while the reflective system is linked to greater longterm success, we still need both systems to make the right choice at the right time. If you’re like most people, then you’ve probably considered casually inviting your ex out while you’re having a lonely night at the bar. But how do you decide if it’s the right choice or not? Again, rather than laying out all possible pros and cons, we instead rely on heuristics, or “rules of thumb,” to make decisions. These short rules are important because they help save us time and energy, and simplify the decision-making process by making certain options off-limits. Heuristics often work like if-then statements, such as: “If you’ve had a couple of drinks, then don’t call your ex.” Some heuristics, like the one about exes, are conscious decisions. However, our automatic systems also use heuristic rules to make quick decisions. For example, if you see a bear in the woods, then run away. However, although heuristics are useful, they can be biased. For instance, when trying to make a sound judgement, you might become influenced by the availability bias, which describes the tendency to believe that the truth is whatever is easily available to your memory. As an example, imagine that you’re out buying a tie for your colleague as a secret Santa gift. But which kind of tie should you get him? To simplify the process, you use the heuristic that “a color he wears often is a safe color for his tie.” However, the color you remember best might not be the color he actually wears most. We have a better memory for things that excite our senses, such as bright colors, so even if he wears a grey tie almost every day, you’ll likely only remember the one time he wore a red tie. And so, when you see his disappointed face as he unwraps his new scarlet tie, you’ll know you’ve been a victim of the availability bias. Why is it that you sometimes want to change your order at a restaurant after discovering that someone at your table chose the same thing? The sad truth is that we want our choices to be unique so that we can feel special. In fact, for many people, being unique is extremely important – even when our uniqueness is completely arbitrary. Consider this experiment, in which researchers asked participants to estimate the number of dots on a video screen. After they made their estimates, participants were informed that the vast majority of people (75 to 80 percent) overestimated the number of dots. But none of the participants were actually told how well they fared in estimating the dots. Instead, half were told they’d overestimated the number of dots, and the other half that they’d underestimated. Those who were told that they overestimated the number (i.e., were part of the “majority”), reported feeling unsatisfied with themselves. The others, however, did not, despite also being told that their estimations were incorrect. In essence, participants weren’t bothered that they were wrong. Rather, they were bothered that they weren’t wrong in a special way. Despite our desire to be different, we also don’t want our choices to be absolutely unique. We can see this in a modified version of the above experiment, carried out by the same researchers. As in the previous experiment, they told some participants that they were in the overestimating majority and others that they were in the underestimating minority. The rest were told that their scores were so odd that the researchers were unable to classify them. Just as before, the “overestimators” reported a decrease in self-esteem, whereas the “underestimators” experienced the opposite. Those whose results were allegedly “too unique,” however, also suffered a decrease in their self-esteem! So, while we all want our choices to be unique, our desire to be special still has limits. Strangely, we aren’t the sole actors when it comes to decision making. In fact, our choices are also heavily influenced by our cultural heritage. This is seen most easily when examining the very different preferences of people from Western and Eastern cultures. Unsurprisingly, people from more individualistic cultures prefer to be in charge of decision making, while collectivistic cultures want others to make their choices for them. We can even see these preferences at a very early age, as shown by this experiment. Asian-American and Anglo-American children were either allowed to choose a toy or were given one by their mothers. The Anglo-American children, who come from a more individualistic culture, played longer with the toy they chose themselves, whereas the Asian-American children, whose cultural background is more heavily rooted in collectivism, preferred playing with the toy chosen for them by their mothers. Understanding your preference in choice is not trivial. In fact, your success depends on whether your particular needs for choice are met. For example, in another experiment, Asian- and Anglo-American children took a math test and later played a computer game called Space Quest, which had been designed to improve their math skills. In the game, they were able to choose the color and name of their spaceship, but with slight variations: one group could choose these customizations freely, while the other was given the settings that most of their classmates chose. After playing Space Quest, they took another math test to see how much their skills had improved. Surprisingly, this seemingly unrelated variation in the experiment had a major impact. Anglo-American children improved by 18 percent when they chose the settings themselves, and showed no improvement when others made their choice. In contrast, Asian-American children improved by 18 percent when they were given the settings, and by only 11 percent when they made the choice themselves. Do you ever become so engrossed in what you are doing that you completely forget the world around you? This selective attention effect is especially noticeable when you’re working on a task that involves concentration. We can see it in action in an experiment called “The Invisible Gorilla.” Researchers showed participants a video in which two teams, wearing black or white shirts, passed around a basketball. During the video, participants were tasked with counting how many times the white team passed the ball. Afterward, they were asked a different question: Did you notice the hairy ape wandering onto the set? Half of them hadn’t seen the person in an ape costume walking slowly through the scene. The gorilla had even stopped for a moment to pound its chest! Because participants were so focused on counting white team passes, they completely missed the “gorilla in the room.” Yet even if we don’t pay attention to all of the information around us, it can still prime our behavior, meaning it has a measurable but subconscious effect on us. Take this study conducted by John Bargh, for instance, in which he gave 30 college students lists of five words in random order and asked them to use these words to build grammatically correct sentences. For one group, he used words that are normally associated with the elderly, such as “wise,” “retired,” “old” and “gray,” while the other group didn’t have the same thematically related words. He then measured how quickly the students walked to the elevator after the experiment. He observed that the group with the “elderly” words had been primed to walk more slowly than the other group, taking an average of 15 percent longer to reach the elevator. Indeed, even the tiniest things can have profound influence on our choices and behavior. Now that you have a better understanding of the mechanisms that affect our choices, the following blinks will examine how these choices affect us. Imagine a life in which you have no choices at all, where every activity, every meal, every thing is determined for you. Sounds pretty miserable, right? Rightly so! Indeed, having choice can have great effects on our general well-being. For example, in the famous Whitehall studies, Michael Marmot followed more than 10,000 British civil servants for a decade starting in 1967 in order to learn more about how work affects our happiness. When he measured their health against their pay grade, he found that higher-paid employees were healthier despite having jobs that involved much greater pressure. In contrast, employees in the lowest pay grade were three times more likely to die from heart disease than their bosses. The researchers concluded that it wasn’t the salary, but the freedom of choice in structuring their tasks that had such a positive effect on higher-paid employees. In fact, choice is so important that even the mere perception of choice can produce health benefits. We can see this clearly in an experiment aimed at investigating how choice could benefit the lives of elderly people in a nursing home. Upon arrival, researchers created two sets of “house rules” for the residents, who were divided into two groups. The first group of residents were assigned a schedule with pre-determined slots for movie time, and were told that they were allowed to visit other floors. The second group were told everything was their choice – when to watch the movie, how they would manage their time, and so on. Functionally, their schedules were the same: all residents were basically free to do whatever they wanted. However, the language used by researchers made it appear as if the first group’s well-being was the responsibility of staff, not of the residents themselves. And this mattered. In a follow-up visit three weeks after the initial test, residents with the ability to “choose” reported feeling happier, while the health of the group with “no” choices had deteriorated. When we’re faced with a tough decision, many of us consult our feelings in the hope that our intuition will guide us to wisdom. However, our feelings aren’t as reliable as we might assume. In part, this is due to the fact that our feelings are influenced by our environment. Take the famous study “Love on a Suspension Bridge,” in which a female researcher stopped male sightseers and asked them a series of questions on the middle of either a dangerous-looking suspension bridge or on a stable bridge. The researcher then asked the subjects to write a short story about a picture of a woman. She also gave participants her phone number in case they “wanted to talk further about the purpose of the study.” 50 percent of the “suspension-bridge group” called to “talk about the study,” compared to only 12.5 percent of the other group. Interestingly, the suspension-bridge groups stories also contained more sexual innuendo. But what could explain this discrepancy? Researchers concluded that participants confused their feelings of anxiety about being on a dangerous bridge with romantic feelings for the researcher. In this way, we can easily see how our environment can affect our emotions, and thus our decisions. Not only are our emotions fickle, but we also sometimes overestimate their intensity. Just consider this study, which followed the extremely close presidential election race in 2000 between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Researchers asked participants how they felt immediately following Gore’s concession speech and then four months after the speech. Four months following Gore’s concession, both Gore and Bush supporters remembered experiencing much stronger feelings than they’d actually reported immediately after his speech, with Gore supporters remembering a deeper sadness and Bush supporters remembering elation. Researchers concluded that we often fabricate our emotions according to our beliefs – “I was a Gore supporter, therefore I must have been sad.” – and thus overestimate our past emotions. Have you ever been called out by a friend for “flip-flopping”? Many of us change our stance on issues in order to back up the choices we’ve made that conflict with those stances. Say, for example, that you’re concerned about your health and therefore only purchase organic foods and won’t take painkillers. However, you’re also a very social person who enjoys having a drink (or two, or three) at the bar with friends. One night, one of your friends calls you out on this apparent hypocrisy, citing the detrimental effects of alcohol on your health. You then experience cognitive dissonance – the uncomfortable feeling that arises when we realize that we hold contradictory beliefs. To combat this cognitive dissonance, you might try to downplay the negative effects of alcohol, and in doing so slightly modify your strict position regarding the consumption of dangerous substances. This doesn’t make you fickle – it merely verifies your humanity. Most of us want to have a consistent view of ourselves. We can’t change our past choices, so we instead change our stance in order to back up the choices we’ve already made. What’s more, we often change our minds without even being aware of it. For instance, when researchers asked hundreds of college seniors to rank the importance of different job attributes during their first post-college job search, students preferred to have the “freedom to make decisions” and wanted “opportunities for creativity.” However, as the months went by and the students became more “realistic” in their job search, they tended to prefer more practical attributes, like “job security.” In the survey’s final round, nearly all the students considered “income” as their priority. When the researchers then asked the students about this shift in priorities, the students were convinced that they had always held these priorities, and hadn’t, in fact, changed their minds! Now that you know how the ability to choose affects you, our final blinks will offer tips on how you can make better choices. You’re standing in the supermarket cereal aisle, totally overwhelmed: How do you choose the one cereal from the 45 other possible choices? Many people experience similar situations in which they become paralyzed by the sheer number of available options. As it turns out, we aren’t really designed to handle that many options. In fact, most of us can’t handle more than seven. In studies where participants are shown differently sized shapes for a short period and then asked to arrange them in order according to their size, they’re able to make generally accurate arrangements until there are seven sizes or more. At this point they begin to make errors – our attention span is simply too limited to handle more than seven options. This information is especially useful in sales; you can influence consumers’ behavior by limiting their available choices. In a famous study involving jelly, the author and her colleagues offered various jellies at a tasting booth in a supermarket in two rounds. During the first round, they offered 24 varieties of jellies, and in the second they offered only six. During their experiment, 60 percent of shoppers were drawn to the booth with 24 jams, but only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Most of them just stood puzzled in front of the shelf only to walk away moments later. In contrast, only 40 percent of shoppers approached the booth with six jellies, but a hefty 30 percent of them actually purchased a jar. In this case, it’s clear that, at least in terms of motivating shoppers to shell out a few extra dollars, less is actually more. As you learned in the previous blink, we can easily become bogged down by an abundance of choice. Luckily, there are steps we can take to prevent ourselves from becoming overwhelmed. First, being clear about your preferences places healthy limits on your choices, thus making decisions easier. For example, if you’re in the market to buy a car and are overwhelmed by the multitude of different options, you can refocus by making a list of your preferences. If you’re looking for just “a car,” then your choices are near limitless. However, by refining your search, you can limit your choices immensely. In fact, you probably don’t want just any old car. You might, for instance, be looking for a station wagon for under $30,000, outfitted with a folding rear seat and a sun roof. By being clear about your preferences, you effectively limit your options, and thus make it easier to make the right decision. Yet even if we limit our choices, we still often have trouble distinguishing similar items. In this case, we can use categorization to aid our decision making. Consider this study, in which participants were able to distinguish seven different audio tones when they differed only in frequency, but could distinguish up to 150 different tones when other dimensions were added, such as intensity, spatial location and duration. These dimensions worked like categories – by categorizing tones with reference to these dimensions, participants were thus able to store more information about the tones, making them more easily distinguishable. Similarly, if you are able to categorize your various car options – in terms of color, size, cost, type, etc. – then it becomes easier to recognize the differences between individual cars. Do you remember the anxiety you felt the last time you had to make a very difficult decision? Did you wish that someone else could choose for you? You might have been happier if that had happened. In fact, sometimes we are happier when we put decisions in other people’s hands. When we face difficult choices, we run the risk of regretting them. Take this heartbreaking series of interviews conducted with American and French parents who had lost an infant. Their children had all been terminally ill, kept alive in an indefinite vegetative state only with the assistance of medical treatment. Eventually, the American parents had to decide to withdraw the treatment. In France, however, such decisions are made by doctors, unless they are explicitly opposed by the parents. Months later, both groups continued to grieve, but the French parents were more convinced by the inevitability of the outcome. In contrast, the American parents, who had made the decision to terminate treatment on their own, felt more regret, doubt and resentment. Yet even when others make our decisions for us, we only feel better if we are informed about the decision. This is exemplified in a study called The Julie Dilemma, in which participants read about the terminally ill child Julie, whom they had to imagine was their own. The experiment devised three possible scenarios: Researchers found that the second group, the informed non-choosers, expressed fewer negative emotions than the choosers from the third group. Surprisingly, the first group of uninformed non-choosers had just as many negative feelings as the choosers. The key message in this book: Decision making is a lot less straightforward than simply weighing the pros and cons of a given set of choices. In fact, our decisions are influenced by external factors far beyond mere rationality. Luckily, with a little bit of knowledge on the art of choosing, you can learn to become a better chooser. Actionable advice: Keep a choice diary. Whenever you make difficult decisions, be sure to log your available options, motivations and expectations for the future. By keeping a diary, you can more accurately assess your choices in hindsight, adjust your decision-making process in the future and avoid making the same mistakes over and over again.

While the concept is simple, the effect is profound. Our behaviors – or what our body is physically doing – can actually trigger our emotions, and not the other way around. Think about it: it means that running away from something could actually make you more afraid! New scientific research has confirmed just how powerful our behavior can be in influencing our emotions. So if you make just a few changes to how you act, you may be able to better stick to that diet, look younger and even be happier. The As If Principle will show you how. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: how if you pretend you’re 18 again you’ll actually feel physically younger; why Chinese children have no fear of tonsil surgery; and how by acting in a romantic movie, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie fell in love. Do you smile when you’re happy? Research has shown that if you smile first, happiness will follow. Philosopher William James first theorized this idea, saying, “If you want to have a quality, act as if you already have it.” James's ideas followed work by Charles Darwin, who established the theory that a person is able to discern another person’s feelings by observing their facial expressions. James in turn wanted to see if facial expressions actually caused those particular feelings. He postulated that people don't smile because they're happy, but that they're happy because they smile. Similarly, you become afraid by running away from a threat, and not the other way around. Studies have shown that people actually feel happier when they force themselves to smile. In one experiment, participants were told the study was examining electrical activity in muscles. Researchers attached electrodes to each participant’s face and measured their reactions as they made different faces. The researchers discovered that when participants smiled, they started to feel happier, even though they knew they were just smiling for an experiment. American psychologist Paul Ekman found that this sort of principle exists all over the world, regardless of culture, from the United States to remote islands in Indonesia. When people look frightened, their heart rate speeds up and their skin temperature drops. When they smile, their heart rate falls and their skin temperature rises. So if you act as if you're experiencing an emotion, it doesn't just affect how you feel – it affects your body. So if you want to feel happy, act as if you already are. This is the “as if” principle. The “as if” principle can apply to many aspects of our lives. Psychologist Sara Snodgrass found that people who take longer steps, walk with a slight bounce and swing their arms, tend to feel happier than people who take small steps and slouch. So can acting like you're in love make you actually fall in love? Different emotions are associated with different bodily sensations. If we replicate those physical sensations, we can make ourselves feel in certain ways. People once thought that a singular emotion caused a particular physical reaction. Psychologist Stanley Schachter refuted this idea in the 1960s when he extended the “as if” principle to bodily sensations. When someone shouts at you, your heart beats faster, and you assume you’re feeling anger or fear. Yet if your heart races when you see an attractive person, you assume it's because you feel desire. In one study, however, researchers had two groups of men consider a woman's attractiveness. One group had to jog in place for two minutes before looking at the woman. With an increased heart rate, the men in the group found the woman more attractive than the other group; the reason being that their bodies interpreted the message of an increased heart rate as desire. So it follows that if you behave like you're in love, you'll increase the chance of love actually happening. Moving closer to a person, looking into their eyes or playing footsie can all make you more attracted to a potential partner. A group of Harvard University researchers studied this effect by preparing participants to play a poker game. Certain male-female pairs were taught to cheat by tapping a secret code on each other's feet. After the game, the researchers asked participants whether they found their poker partner attractive. The pairs who practised played footsie found each other more attractive than those partners who didn't make foot contact! Interestingly, many actors have fallen in love after playing lovers in a film. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and Warren Beatty and Annette Benning are all couples who first met as lovers on screen. Saying is believing. If you behave like you believe in something, your opinions can actually change. Former U.S. President Lyndon Johnson used this to his advantage during the Vietnam War, a conflict that caused much strain in U.S. society and many casualties on both sides. Some administration officials disagreed with Johnson's methods in handling the war. Instead of trying to convince these men of his point of view, Johnson instead sent them personally on fact-finding missions to Vietnam, and in the process they had to give high-profile speeches about the war, defending the government's position. In the process of hearing themselves repeat the government’s arguments for war, many of the officials came to actually believe what they were saying – the “as if” principle at work. The “as if” principle can create positive or negative change. If you can get a person to act a certain way, it’s possible that they’ll begin to think in a certain way, too. A group of American prisoners of war experienced this firsthand during the Korean War. Spending time in camps, they were encouraged by their captors to express their support for communism, first by writing down positive sentences about communism, then by reading the statements out loud and debating their merits. Eventually, prisoners were rewarded with fresh food or fruit if they penned essays extolling the virtues of communism. Through this process, many servicemen came to truly believe what they were saying, and some even chose to stay in North Korea to live under communism after the war was over. Rewarding people for work done isn’t a great long-term strategy, as rewards encourage people to behave as if they don’t want to do the activity for which they’re being rewarded. The logic is simple. We think, “I’m being given money for something I don’t want to do. Therefore, this thing can’t be fun.” The prospect of a pay-off can actually turn play into drudgery! Psychologist Edward Devi studied this phenomena by having volunteers solve a puzzle for 30 minutes. Some volunteers were told that they’d get money for solving the puzzle. Interestingly, the people who expected cash for finishing worked less hard on the puzzle. In comparison, the other volunteers worked harder as they were doing it for their own enjoyment. Even thinking about a reward can be detrimental. Another researcher found that when writers were asked to think about the financial success of bestselling authors, their work was less creative. They wrote better when they focused on the intrinsic pleasure of writing. Instead of offering a reward, you can use the “as if” principle to motivate people. When someone sees themselves acting in a certain way, they'll be motivated to keep acting in that way. A small change can have a big impact, as researcher Patricia Pliner illustrated in a charity experiment. A group of people in a neighborhood were approached by volunteers to donate to a cancer charity. Of the first group asked directly for money, some 46 percent decided to donate. Another group of residents, however, had had a visit two weeks earlier, when a volunteer asked them to simply wear a pin to support the cause. They didn’t ask for a donation at the time. Yet when volunteers came around a second time to ask for a donation, over 90 percent of residents agreed. They felt that they were already supporting the charity, and so they wanted to continue! We’ve seen how physical behavior can inspire emotions. But can behavior alter your personality? Psychologist James Laird was interested to test whether a person who suffered a demeaning experience would have as a result lowered self-esteem. His results, as well as those of other experimenters, showed just how powerful the “as if” principle can be. In his experiment, Laird divided his team into two groups. Through flipping a coin, the groups would determine what they had to do: either lift heavy weights, or eat a worm. Just before the group stuck eating the worm were about to dig in, one of Laird’s associates rushed in the room and told the group they didn’t have to eat them after all. Yet interestingly, only 20 percent of the worm-eaters agreed to put their forks down – the rest didn’t fight their fate. What happened? Faced with a degrading task, the participants took on the mantle of the degraded, and their self-esteem suffered as a result. (Yet no one really had to eat a worm, in the end.) Questioning Laird’s results, other psychologists performed similar experiments yet replaced the worms with caterpillars. Curiously, the results were still the same. The way you dress can also influence your self-perception. Wearing a black shirt can make you more authoritarian and aggressive, while wearing baggy, comfortable clothing can make you more tolerant. Cornell researcher Mark Frank studied the behavior of athletes when wearing a series of different colored uniforms. When players wore black, Frank found that they were more aggressive, regardless of the sport. Role-playing certain characteristics can also make you develop those characteristics as your own. Psychologist Philip Zimbardo's infamous “Stanford prison experiment” in the 1970s illustrated this dramatically. Zimbardo had volunteers role-play a prison situation, where half were prisoners and half were guards. The guards became abusive and violent almost immediately; and Zimbardo stopped the experiment after just six days, even though it was planned to go for two weeks. While the volunteers at the start merely pretended to be abusive guards, their feelings and behaviors adapted almost immediately to the new situation, and they became abusive guards in reality. Millions of people across the globe struggle with psychological disorders, such as phobias or depression. Could the “as if” principle help them? Absolutely. It can help reduce feelings we don’t want. In the 1990s, a group of researchers discovered that people who had had botox injections – a beauty treatment that essentially paralyzes the muscles of the face, to combat wrinkles – felt less of an emotional reaction when they watched certain video clips. This experience is in line with the “as if” principle: if your body doesn’t physically express an emotion, you'll feel less emotion. So if you feel pain but you act like you don’t, you’ll actually feel the pain less. In the 1970s, a British doctor named Peter Brown noticed that children in China seem unafraid of having their tonsils surgically removed. They had been taught to view the procedure positively, and so before the operation, they were relaxed and smiled often. As a result, they felt less pain. The “as if” principle can help minimize other negative emotions, too. You can reduce anger by acting calm, for instance. In fact, research has shown that couples who are verbally aggressive with each other are more likely to become physically aggressive. This works the other way around: acting depressed makes us more depressed. One researcher was able to help people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks by teaching them how to relax, and to see how their bodies were reacting in a more positive light. So when you feel anxious, think about how this could benefit you. Nervousness before an exam could help you study, and a bit of adrenaline might be good in an interview. Act the way you want to feel, and the feeling will become a reality. Using the “as if” principle can help you reach your dietary goals, too, as behaving in a healthy way can actually improve your health. This is especially true with food. A researcher in the 1960s found that we eat for two reasons: either we get an internal signal from our body, telling us we’re hungry, or we get an external signal, such as seeing a delicious cake in a shop window. Slimmer people tend to follow their internal signals, while overweight folks follow external ones. This means that if you act like you're hungry, or you see things that make you feel like you're hungry, you'll eat even if you don't need to. So if you want to diet, avoid external signals and focus on yourself and what your body needs. Eat when you're hungry, and stop when you feel full. Also, don't watch TV, listen to music or read when you eat. Focus on yourself alone and your food. If self-discipline with food is hard for you, try eating in front of a mirror or with your non-dominant hand. What’s more, acting younger can even slow the effects of aging. Psychologist Ellen Langer studied this phenomena with men in their 70s and 80s. One group was asked to remember their lives in 1959. They listened to radio broadcasts from the period and talked about their memories in the present tense. The other group was asked instead to share stories about their current lives. After a week, the first group showed improvements in dexterity, speed, memory, eyesight, hearing and blood pressure. In an intelligence test, some 60 percent of the first group did better, while only 40 percent of the second group improved. Acting like they were “younger” actually knocked years off their bodies and minds! The key message in this book: Our emotions don’t control our behavior; instead, our behavior controls our emotions. If you smile, you’ll feel happy, and if you act younger, you’ll feel younger too! If you apply the “as if” principle, you can fundamentally change who you are –  not only emotionally but also physically. Actionable advice: Tempted to eat a plate of cookies? Just push it away. If you physically push a plate of cookies away from you, it signals to your body and your brain that you’re not interested in it. In response, your body will feel less hunger for the cookies. So if you know you don't want something, act like it, and your resolve will strengthen. Suggested further reading: The Magic of Thinking Big by David J.

In his work as a financial planner, author Carl Richards saw the effects of this firsthand. Everywhere he looked, people were making lousy decisions and suffering as a consequence. This is what drove Richards to write The Behavior Gap. These blinks show you how tuning out all the noise and focusing on your own personal goals will help you invest wisely, secure your financial future and live a happier life. In addition, you’ll learn why you shouldn’t always follow The Economist’s advice; why trying to predict the future could damage your finances; and why you should talk to your kids about money. Do you ever find yourself doing something that you shouldn’t, like having a third piece of cake even though you want to lose weight? This is called the behavior gap: a rift between what we know we should do, and what we actually do. This phenomenon is tied to our natural desire to avoid pain and seek pleasure, which leads us to act irrationally. One effect is that we often adopt a herd mentality, where we behave exactly like those around us without pausing to make our own decisions. This is because we assume it’s safer to do what everyone else is doing. This was seen in the 1990s dot-com boom. It seemed everyone was reaping huge profits on investments, so even ordinary people began borrowing money against their home equity, and ended up investing over $44 billion in stocks. Then when the NASDAQ shed half its value, people lost their investments and found themselves deeply in debt. This kind of reasoning can be found at the root of any market bubble. These situations produce a behavior gap: Instead of acting rationally, people get excited and let emotions guide their choices. To close the gap, think beyond today’s trends and remember surprising past events: the dot-com crash, the housing bubble, the 2008 debt crisis. All these incidents underscore the importance of investing carefully, without getting caught up in boom-and-bust cycles. Thinking about them will help you close the behavior gap by making the consequences of herd mentality more concrete. Also, avoid overconfidence. In the 1990s, Long-Term Capital, a hedge fund run by Nobel Prize winners, learned this lesson. Blinded by its own pedigree, the company’s board of directors was positive the firm could never lose more than $35 million per day. But one day, to their horror, the firm lost $553 million. Eventually, the company had to be bailed out by the Federal Reserve. We can’t predict the future; we can only control our own behavior. Have you ever wondered, What’s the world’s best investment? If so, you’re asking the wrong question. Here’s why: Planning for your future entails a delicate balance between living for today and saving for later. In this balancing act of spending and saving, the investment – that is, an asset expected to earn value over time – is only a small part of your financial future. In addition to seeking out high return investments, you could also secure your finances by saving more money, retiring later or pursuing a second career. In fact, since it’s impossible to predict how investments will fare over time, no single investment can categorically be “the best.” Instead of chasing this mythical unicorn, judge financial products by how well they help you reach your goals. No single investment can ever satisfy everyone, so ask yourself: What is the best investment for me? The answer will depend on personal factors – your goals, your personality, your existing holdings, even your credit card. For example, if you want to pay for your kids’ college in the future, you could open an educational account or invest in mutual funds at least 18 years before college enrollment. You should aim to save around $240,000. Of course, the college fund won’t be any use if your kids aren’t accepted somewhere, so don’t forget to help them with their homework! As you can see, wise investments are pieces of a larger puzzle. Some people don’t take this approach. Instead, they deal with their portfolio like baseball card collectors, buying shares based on magazine recommendations, with no cohesive strategy. Don’t make this mistake. You’re not a collector, you’re an investor. Judge financial products according to how they help you reach your goals. If they don’t help you, don’t invest in them – end of story. This way, your financial decisions will be based on principles, not emotions. Most of us love giving advice. It makes us feel important and wise. But that’s exactly why most advice is fundamentally useless. Harsh words? Not really. Most of the advice we hear is generic, which means it doesn’t necessarily apply to our specific situation. This is especially true when it comes to financial advice. A good financial plan is personal and unique, so what’s right for you might be a catastrophe for someone else. Of course, plenty of people don’t know that – or care. Millions read The Economist thinking they can beat the market by following the expert advice within. But generic advice can fail us. Here’s an example: People who want to lose weight are told to work out everyday. That might be good advice for many, but it won’t help someone with a heart condition. Additionally, most “expert” advisors are prone to conflicts of interest. Most of us intuitively understand this. That’s why we would never expect a salesman at a Toyota dealership to tell us that Honda makes the greatest cars in the world. So there are many reasons to be skeptical. The good news is, once you can detect unsound and irrelevant advice, you can then find advice that’s actually useful to you. And to that end, you can stop chasing the perfect investment or portfolio. Instead, you can design your portfolio to suit your current understanding of the market and adapt when things change. Think about it: You wouldn’t want someone telling you what to wear each morning. Instead, you trust your own sense of style and your own knowledge of your life! Similarly, there’s no reason to try to become the next Warren Buffett. You are you. With that in mind: In the following blink, you’ll find out why exploring your own goals, strengths and weaknesses is essential for your financial strategy. Why do so many of us strive for financial security? We have good reasons: We just want to be happy and provide a good life for our loved ones. Happiness is very important, but we should always try to remember that true happiness is more about expectations and desire than how much we earn. There’s proof: A recent study by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman and Princeton professor Angus Deaton found that happiness is correlated to income only up to an individual earnings level of $75,000 per year. After that threshold, those with higher incomes don’t have commensurately higher levels of emotional well-being. This means most people are overemphasizing their finances. If money can only buy you so much happiness, then beyond this point, money is merely a tool for pursuing things that bring true satisfaction to your life. For example, money can allow you to travel and see the world, buy a huge garden, or support a cause you deeply believe in. So in order to make truly wise financial decisions, you have to know yourself. That way, you can align the use of your assets with your personal values. David Brooks, op-ed columnist at the New York Times, is a proponent of this approach – but on a broader scale. He has argued that instead of tracking economic trends, governments should focus more on measuring whether social programs and institutions directly increase overall happiness levels. We can apply this principle on an individual level: Stop worrying so much about money. Instead, pursue your personal goals. This will allow you to make the best financial choices. To do this, look inward rather than outward. In the upcoming blinks, you’ll learn to cut through all the noise about the economy and maintain focus. We all want to be informed and knowledgeable about financial markets and the economy. But listening to mainstream media can actually lead you astray. That’s because mainstream media often propagates a herd mentality: making us feel safer in numbers. So when we follow the media’s advice, we take comfort in knowing that we’re behaving the same way as everyone else. Intuitively, we might understand that just because everyone’s doing it, doesn’t mean it’s right – but we humans are anxious creatures so the herd is very appealing. While understandable, following the crowd can be costly. Take the subprime mortgage crisis of 2006, when housing prices fell 30 percent on average. Worse yet, stock market prices fell 57 percent from their October 2007 peak. These collapses resulted from the fact that both assets had been massively overvalued, because everyone was “following the herd” and buying them, driving their prices up. So be wise: Don’t follow the herd. Ignore (almost) everything the media says. The media does, of course, report some sound information; however, the sheer quantity makes it impossible to sift through and find what really matters. This saturation makes it very easy to follow the wrong advice. Examples of media misinformation abound. Here’s just one: In a 2010 article, The Economist happily declared, “America’s Back!” The feature provided a long list of positive indications of economic recovery. But as it turned out, their predictions were wrong – the economy stumbled again. Luckily, there’s a way to deal with all this financial misinformation: Be more aware of what’s driving all the news and rumors you encounter in mainstream media and, more generally, worry less about money. When you clear your mind of all that clutter and tune out the noise, you can get back in touch with your real goals. That way, when you have to think about money, you’ll think in terms of what matters to you. Do you know the difference between planning and formulating a plan? There’s a distinction: A plan makes predictive assumptions about the future. But no matter how hard we try to predict the future, we’ll be wrong. On the other hand, planning isn’t about predicting the future, it’s about preparing for it. Planning involves making decisions based on what is happening now, not assuming you know what’s to come. And it’s especially valuable because it leaves room for surprises. For example: In 2004 the author bought a $575,000 house, for which the previous owner had paid $400,000. When the value of the house rose to $1 million in 2007, the author expected house prices to continue rising, so he didn’t try to sell it to make a profit. But then when the market crashed, the author found himself owing more than the house was worth. Unfortunately, in a turbulent financial market, we will all face surprises like these some day. So how can you deal with them? Just make constant course corrections to stay on track with your financial goals, adjusting your planning as circumstances change. Think about it this way: Imagine you’re piloting a cross-country flight from Los Angeles to Miami. If you’re just a smidgen off-course when you take off, it’ll still seem like you’re flying in the right direction, but you’ll eventually end up in Maine. Most pilots wouldn’t let that happen. Similarly, staying on course for financial goals requires you to pay attention to where you are and to make small adjustments to your trajectory. To do that, it’s best to think in shorter time frames: Focus on the next three years, not the next 15. That way, you’re working towards a larger goal without getting overwhelmed by the big picture. Emotions make us human, but there’s a high cost to allowing your feelings to shape your financial decisions. So how can you avoid letting emotions dictate your finances? First of all, be honest with yourself: Great investments require just as much luck as skill. Sometimes you make smart decisions that lead to successful investments. Other times, you’re just lucky. Another way to avoid making emotional decisions is the Overnight Test: Ask yourself, if someone sold all your investments overnight, which stocks would you buy again tomorrow? In this theoretical situation, you might let a few investments go. We often hang on to investments just because we’re used to them, the same way we might hang on to a loveless relationship just because we’re comfortable with it. This is where the Overnight Test helps us cut through our pre-existing biases and re-evaluate our investments objectively. So if you’re unsure of whether to keep an investment, ask yourself: Would I buy it again tomorrow? If the answer is no, toss it. A third way to ensure your emotions aren’t guiding your finances: Always ensure the decision could potentially help you reach personal goals. Some people don’t do this. Instead, they buy a stock because it’s “the next big thing.” But investing in something just because it’s trendy isn’t really a financial choice. Here’s what is: Building savings for retirement. So think about what you actually want for yourself and your family in the future. Then ask yourself whether the potential investment plays a clear role in the portfolio you need to help meet these financial goals. Of course, its always possible that the rational decision won’t have the expected results. Because even if you take these precautions, investing always forces us to make decisions in the midst of uncertainty. The only thing you can do: Make the best possible decision today and take responsibility for the potential results. Children are taught to admit when they’ve done something wrong. But do we adults follow our own advice? If you’re not used to taking responsibility for your actions, it can be hard. But it’s essential to improving your finances. For example, an acquaintance of the author believed that buying expensive clothes and driving a BMW would make him more successful. But there was nothing beneath the surface of all this shiny stuff, and the cost of keeping up these appearances drove him into serious debt. Instead of faking success, he should have diligently worked his way up the career ladder. That’s hard work, and it requires patience and discipline. But to make a positive change, hard work is necessary. Another key to improving your finances is to keep examining your assumptions about what really impacts your financial situation. Too often we focus on irrelevant things. For example, one day the author took a long drive to get cheap gas. Midway through, he did some mental calculations: He realized that if he saved ten cents a gallon on a 20-gallon tank, the savings would add up to $2. That figure barely covered the amount of gas he used on the drive. If he had realized this sooner, he would have saved himself a long drive. As you can see, even financially solid-seeming plans like buying cheaper gas require closer scrutiny. However, although a thorough examination of your decisions helps ensure positive outcomes, you also need to realize you’re never fully in control. For example, if you send your daughter to Harvard, you’re making a huge investment in her financial future. But after graduation, your daughter might decide to teach underprivileged kids at an urban high school for $19,000 a year. For her, this is the right outcome. However, it’s not exactly what you expected when you decided to invest in her education. As these kinds of surprises can await any of us, it’s better to accept them beforehand. Many people feel that it’s still taboo to talk openly about money with friends and relatives. Since everyone has a different background and attitude toward it, money can sometimes feel like a dangerous topic. But if you’re committed to making sound financial decisions, it’s too important to skirt around. So if we want to avoid misunderstandings, we need to consider our own biases and strive to find a common language. Here’s a misunderstanding around money that arose in the author’s life: He and his wife were talking to a friend about the friend’s recent kitchen renovation, and as he detailed all the work that had been done, the author automatically started calculating the costs of the project. Later, he told his wife that they couldn’t afford their own renovation. His wife was confused, because she’d just been chatting about someone else’s kitchen renovation – not planning to embark on an identical project. And this after 15 years of marriage! If it gets this confusing for husbands and wives to talk about money, it can be even more upsetting to discuss the subject with our kids. But don’t let your discomfort stop you. Another example from the author’s life: His friend wanted to be honest with her children about finances. Whenever the children demanded an unreasonable purchase, she told her children, “We can’t afford that.” Far from being awkward, this tactic actually resulted in a fruitful family discussion: Their 14-year-old son asked how poor the family really was, on a scale from one to ten. As his parents quickly realized, the boy wasn’t disappointed in his family’s financial situation, but rather concerned about their well-being. So overall, talking about money with your family and friends can be truly beneficial, even when it’s uncomfortable. And in the end, these conversations can be treated in a frank, simple way. Have you ever heard the phrase, “Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication?” It also applies to your finances. Simple solutions can bring us closer to our goals, while complexity slows us down. For example, people spend $40 billion a year on weight loss programs even though the do-it-yourself approach – consuming fewer calories and exercising – is the most effective. Regardless, people get lost in complex commercial diet plans and products, and often don’t reach their goals. If they did, weight loss wouldn’t be a $40 billion industry. This is where simplicity comes in: Always keep it simple. Instead of buying expensive products, go running every morning. This principle can also guide your finances. Don’t buy into the latest fad, spend your money carefully and save gradually. This approach is called slow and steady capital. Building slow and steady capital requires you to avoid the temptations of instant gratification. In fact, delaying gratification is hugely important to long-term success overall. In the 1950s, Stanford launched a decade-long study that looked at people’s ability to delay gratification, and found that people who were better able to postpone the fulfillment of their desires experienced greater long-term success than those who gave in to temptation. So when it comes to accumulating your slow and steady capital, don’t look for huge short-term gains; instead, takes steps to accumulate long-term wealth slowly. This will help you avoid big losses and ensure financial security. Sounds boring? Good. Be boring in your financial habits.  Spend less than you earn. Set money aside. Pay your debt. Steer clear of large losses. This conservative approach to money can lead to big results over time. For example, the author once met a gentleman who had turned a relatively small inheritance into an impressive fortune. The author asked this man about the secret to his amazing financial success, and he replied, confused, that there was no secret. He had just avoided extravagant purchases and instead bought “boring things,” paying for them gradually like everyone else. The key message in this book: Sometimes there’s a rift between what we should do and what we actually do. This is called the behavior gap and it often prevents us from making smart financial decisions. We have to take steps to avoid this – and close the behavior gap – by being honest with ourselves and thoroughly examining the factors involved in our decisions. The keys to sustainable investments are keeping things simple and taking responsibility for our actions. Actionable advice: Take time each month to reflect on your personal goals and make sure your investments line up accordingly.  The best way to meet your investment goals is to align them with your personal goals. That way your financial decisions and your personal values will support, rather than work against each other. Let’s say you’re trying to decide whether to invest your savings in a bank account or in stock. If one of your personal goals is to buy a motorcycle in six months, then the bank account is probably a better option, since it’s less volatile than stocks and also easier to withdraw money from. But if your personal goal is to save up for your children’s college fund, and you only intend to withdraw money in 20 years time, then stocks are probably a better option, as they will generate higher profits.

But chimps, beyond reminding us of our evolutionary past and playing a role in popular culture, occupy a psychological place within us all. This chimp-like part of our brain affects our decisions, emotions and how we interact with other people. Sometimes it’s in conflict with the more rational and human side of our brain and makes us behave in ways we might otherwise try to avoid. Here, we will delve into the universe that is our brain and try to understand some of its more base reactions. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to determine whether your chimp side is governing your actions; what the computer part of your brain is; and that we communicate in four major ways. It doesn’t take a neuroscientist to know that people don’t always act rationally. In fact, even when people know what the most rational response should be, we often end up doing something entirely different. But how come? Because our brains are divided into two distinct parts. The first is the “human,” or rational, part, which is located in the frontal lobe. This part of the brain thinks and acts based on facts. The second part, which lives in the limbic system, is known as the inner chimp. The functions of this section of the brain are more primitive and immediate. In other words, the chimp part of the brain acts based on feelings and emotions. Naturally these two ways of processing information can easily come into conflict, and when they do, the chimp brain often prevails. After all, the limbic system, which is evolutionarily much older, works faster, sending stronger impulses to action. For instance, imagine that a man named John complains to his wife, Pauline, about an incident he experienced that morning; their neighbor’s car was blocking their driveway and, since John was late for work, he had to ask the neighbor to move it. Hearing this, Pauline asks why he’s complaining; their neighbor had moved his car quickly and everything’s fine again. John’s human brain can hear the statement as a fact, understand that it’s true and leave it at that. But if his chimp brain were to prevail in this situation, John might hear Pauline’s comment as a criticism. And this might lead him to ask why she never supports him, or result in him defensively saying that he’s not making a big deal out of the experience. Most people have, at some point, found themselves involved in such irrational fights. To avoid these uncomfortable clashes, it’s key for the human brain to actively manage the chimp brain. In the next blink you’ll learn precisely how. So the human brain is comprised of two different parts and it’s key to be able to manage them. Here’s how: First, in any given interaction, you should begin by determining which section of your brain is directing your behavior: Is it the human or the chimp? To figure this out, you can ask yourself simple questions that begin with, “Do I want…?” By answering them, you’ll learn which part of the brain you’re following. For instance, you might ask yourself, “Do I want to behave this way?” or “Do I want to feel these feelings?” If you answer no to these questions, it’s a sure sign that the chimp is in control. To make it more concrete, let’s say you’re obsessively worrying about being late for a meeting. You could ask yourself, “Do I want to be worried about this?” If you say no, you can be sure that you’ve got an inner-chimp problem that needs to be managed. Once you’ve determined this, you can reign in this emotional side of yourself by giving it a little exercise. We’re not talking jumping rope or jogging. Rather, exercising your inner chimp is about giving it the freedom to vent. For example, imagine an interaction that made you angry – say, someone bumping into you at the supermarket without so much as an “excuse me.” The key here is to allow yourself to express anger in an entirely uncensored way in a safe environment, ranting and raving about the encounter for ten minutes and saying whatever pops into your head. By making space for this time you’ll likely satisfy your inner chimp and the anger will fade into the background. However, for this technique to be effective, a truly safe environment is absolutely necessary. Don’t go ape on the person in the supermarket. Instead, find a place where you can be alone and say everything you wanted to yell at the person in the moment. Don’t worry about how long it takes; just keep going until the emotions begin to subside. That’s how you manage your inner chimp. But, of course, it’s not that simple. There’s a third player in this game, too – a part of your brain that you’ll learn about in the next blink. Now that you know about the human and chimp parts of your brain, it’s time to learn about another part. It’s called the computer and it’s responsible for automatic functions based on learned patterns. This is essential since autopilot plays a major role in the lives of most humans. Such automatic behavior is based on patterns you’ve learned, beliefs you’ve absorbed and programs you’ve established. For instance, when you make your morning coffee, chew your sandwich at lunch or brush your teeth before bed, you’re conducting actions that you’ve done every day for years, if not decades. You do them practically without thought or conscious effort. Naturally, such an ability has its benefits. For instance, if you grew up in a loving family, you’ll default to a pattern of assuming that people love and value you. However, not all automation is useful. There are also nefarious elements to the automatic functioning of the brain. These are called goblins. They’re the destructive patterns you’ve formed based on lived experience and, just like their useful counterparts, they’re stored in your computer. As an example, imagine a child brings home a drawing she made at school. A well-intentioned dad might compliment the child’s work, hug her and put the picture up on the fridge. While that all sounds well and good, it might have unintended side effects. For instance, the child might begin to think that she’ll only be loved for her achievements, thereby creating a pattern of thinking along the lines of “I’m unlovable unless I perform well.” Clearly, such patterns are dangerous, and one should do all one can to discourage the formation of goblins. The father might have done well to take a different tack. First, he could have put the drawing aside, hugged his daughter and told her that he loves her and is proud of her. From there, he could then look at the drawing and ask her if she wants to put it up on the fridge, neutralizing any connection between the achievement and his love. That being said, this approach really only works for nipping goblins in the bud. So, next up, you’ll learn how to get rid of the ones that already exist. So goblins are real and they can cause some serious trouble. To handle them, you’ll need to get your computer into shape, and that means implanting positive patterns. Here’s how to do it: First, you need to identify which goblins actually reside within your computer. This initial step is essential since both the chimp and the human parts of your brain look to the computer when they don’t know how to act. And if there’s a goblin in the computer – say, a negative behavioral pattern – the result will be unsettling for both the emotional chimp and the rational human. Unfortunately, goblins are often well hidden, resulting in all kinds of issues. For instance, imagine you’re standing in line to buy a coffee when someone cuts in front of you. The human will want to politely let them know that you’re in line, while the chimp will lunge to knock the person off their feet. But before either of these impulses can be acted on, they’ll look to the computer. Now, if there’s a goblin in the computer saying that you’re not as good as other people, both the chimp and the human will back down and you won’t react at all. Such a goblin can prevent you from doing all kinds of things, and the first step toward dealing with it is identifying it. Once you’ve figured out that there’s a goblin in your computer, you can simply replace it with a positive pattern. So if your goblin is telling you that you’re worth less than others, try adopting a positive alternative – for instance, that you are just as good as the people around you. From there, you should be attentive to your state of mind and work to notice when the negative goblin rears its head. Every time it does, just replace it with the positive view until it becomes absolutely automatic. If you can manage to build in this new autopilot, you’ll eventually deal with difficult situations politely, without even giving it a second thought. Being able to hear where other people are coming from is essential to navigating the world, and if you want to do this well, you need to calm down your chimp. Once you do, you’ll realize that different people have different brains. This might come as a surprise since people tend to assume that the brains of others work just like theirs. But this assumption inevitably leads to misunderstandings, which in turn anger the chimp. When you quiet down the chimp by using the methods you’ve now learned, however, you’ll be able to discern different perspectives on life. Just take an extreme example that the author encountered in his work. One of his clients was the father of an 18-year-old boy with some unusual traits caused by autism. For instance, he would use an entire bottle of shampoo every time he took a shower. Another issue was that, every night when his father returned from work, the son would greet him with an endless stream of questions until the father couldn’t take it any more. These behavioral idiosyncrasies clearly demonstrate how utterly different human minds can be. Obviously, most people aren’t as particular as the son in this example, but, nonetheless, connecting with and understanding others can be very difficult. It often requires both patience and creativity. (The father eventually solved the issues with his son by putting portioned-out bottles of shampoo in the shower and setting a rule of no more than three questions per evening.) So, to help you understand others, keep these three points in mind: First, don’t assume anything about other people. Just because someone appears distant or distracted doesn’t necessarily imply that they’re unfriendly. They might just be dealing with a personal problem you know nothing about. Second, don’t have unreasonable expectations of others. After all, people make mistakes and expecting them to be perfect all the time is a recipe for disappointment. And, finally, it’s essential to abandon all prejudice, both positive and negative. It’s best to simply take people as they are and try to get to know them. You just learned how easy it is to misunderstand others. Now think of how frustrating it can be trying to communicate with different people. It’s no secret that communication, or a lack thereof, can cause all kinds of problems, but the good news is that it’s a skill you can practice. But before we get there, let’s take a look at the four basic ways that people communicate, all of which involve your chimp and human brains. First, your human brain can communicate with another human brain. Second, your human brain can communicate with someone else’s chimp brain. Third, your chimp can communicate with another person’s human brain and, finally, your chimp can communicate with another chimp. In this final scenario, the results tend to be pretty ugly and the resulting calamity is familiar to anyone who has seen a couple in an argument. To avoid such unpleasantness, let’s take a look at how to set up ideal conditions from the get-go. To get off on the right foot, it’s important to deal with issues as they arise and to speak in an assertive but not aggressive way. People tend to talk about such problems with everyone but the person they have an issue with. This is not a good way to go about things. It’s better to deal with the person directly while keeping in mind that aggression usually makes matters worse. After all, aggressive communication is emotional communication and it will necessarily trigger an emotional response. Assertiveness, on the other hand, is about explaining where you’re coming from. For instance, imagine that you arrive late to a dinner date with a friend, who then gets upset and begins yelling at you. Being assertive in such a situation would mean doing three things. First, telling the person what you don’t want; second, explaining how the situation makes you feel; and, finally, saying what you do want. More concretely, you might tell the friend that you don’t want to be shouted at, that it makes you feel intimidated and that you’d prefer if he spoke in a quieter voice. By now you’ve seen how the brain and its different parts affect human behavior. Now it’s time to learn how the chimp and human brains can impact your health. It’s true, the brain even affects your physical well-being, so it’s easy to improve your health by bringing your attention to solutions rather than problems. In fact, the dilemma of physical health is quintessential to the human-vs-chimp debate; the human wants to exercise and lose weight while the chimp just wants to plop down in front of the television with a huge tub of ice cream. When faced with this contradiction, focusing on problems like being overweight will only strengthen your inner chimp, since the worse you feel about yourself, the more you’ll seek out the quick comforts of junk food and laziness. So, instead of falling into this trap, just focus on what you want. In this case, that means getting some exercise and shedding a few pounds. In other words, to get healthy, you’ve got to be both proactive and responsive. The former means having a plan and the latter means that, if your plan fails, you’ll be able to regroup and patch things together. For instance, imagine you want to get in shape. You get a membership to the local gym and schedule two workouts per week with a fit friend. Just like that, you’ve got a plan. But then, after two weeks, you find yourself missing your allotted gym time. Now you’ve got to be responsive. So, instead of dwelling on your failures, try telling your workout buddy how much you enjoy your gym time and how much progress you’re making. Such a simple comment will encourage your emotional chimp, whose only goal is to feel good and save face. Chances are, you’ll happily turn up at the gym next time around to prove to your friend that you were serious. Did you know that happiness is actually a choice? That doesn’t mean that you get to be happy whenever you want, but, rather, that life has its ups and downs, and that you can actively work to have more good times and fewer bad ones. So how does this work? Well, it’s all about adding good things to your life. Remember: there’s nothing superficial about seeking out what you need to be happy. For instance, there are certain material things that you likely need to feel happy and relaxed – like food, a comfortable apartment and a shower. However, there are also emotional things you probably want, like the love of a partner or the respect of your colleagues and friends. No matter what you want, write all these wants down and consider how you’ll bring the items on your list into your life. But as you do, keep in mind that pushing to do too much can obscure all your great achievements along the way. In other words, the real issue with happiness is that the chimp part of your brain will never be satisfied; it will always seek out more, dangerously leading to achievement, but not happiness. Just imagine an athlete whose ultimate goal is to win an Olympic medal. On her journey to the top she picks up a number of national titles, putting on brilliant displays of athleticism. However, despite these accomplishments, she never celebrates. Chances are that, even if she does win that Olympic gold, she won’t be able to enjoy it. Instead, she’ll immediately move on to the next potential win. Such a practice is a recipe for disaster and, to avoid it, you simply need to appreciate your achievements as they come, ensuring that you enjoy the happiness that you originally strove for. Once you’ve nailed down this piece, you’ll have a complete toolkit for outsmarting your chimp. Just remember to make healthy plans that counter your primal urges, let yourself vent in safe spaces, communicate with wisdom and love and celebrate all your successes along the way! The key message in this book: Your brain is composed of distinct parts, each operating according to its own internal logic. Some are rational, thoughtful and objective, while others are highly emotional and impulsive or simply automatic. While such differences can naturally come into conflict, you can manage them through awareness and training. Actionable advice: When choosing a partner, take both his chimp and his human into account. Finding a romantic partner can be difficult, but you can get a better sense of the whole person if you consider both sides of their brain. For example, a person’s human side might be loving, generous, fun and engaging while the chimp side is vehemently opposed to monogamy. Whatever the differences, it’s important for you to identify the characteristics that might be deal breakers for you, since you probably won’t be able to change your partner’s basic traits.

But how did these people become so accomplished in their creative fields, and how can we emulate their success? In these blinks, we’ll explore the scientific and social underpinnings of success. We’ll go on a journey that looks at some of history’s geniuses – such as Leonardo da Vinci and Charles Darwin – and ask whether their success was down to unique inspiration, convenient timing or merely good luck. We’ll look at the sorts of friends and teachers the most successful people had by their side, and explore the hidden phenomenon behind many successful products and creative ideas: the creative curve. In the following blinks, you’ll discover the surprising truth about the relationship between intelligence and creativity; the reason why the most popular creative ideas are more familiar than they are original; and how your friends influence your creative potential. How creative would you say you are? If you want to find out, start by trying to think of as many uncommon ways you could use a hairdryer as possible. One idea might be to use it as a leaf blower. This exercise is a test of your ability for divergent thinking – the ability to find multiple solutions to a problem. Divergent thinking is strongly associated with creativity. In other words, the more ways you thought of using that hairdryer, the more creative potential you probably have. Looking at people’s divergent thinking abilities has helped scientists understand the relationship between creativity and intelligence.   In 2013, Austrian psychologists investigating creativity and intelligence found that once participants’ IQ scores went above 86, their score was no longer predictive of their divergent thinking abilities. A person with a genius-level IQ of 150 was no more likely to think of more solutions to a problem than someone with a more average IQ of 100. In other words, beyond a relatively low threshold, your overall intelligence makes no difference to your potential for creativity. Around 80% of the world’s population has an IQ above this threshold of 86. Astoundingly, this means that roughly three billion people are walking around with the same creative potential as the geniuses we are taught to idolize. So how can more of us unlock this potential? Research indicates that it all comes down to practice. But not just any type of practice – it must enable you to expand your skills and challenge yourself. Studies by Professor K. Anders Ericsson of Florida State University have found that to become an expert in any field, one must practice in a way that emphasizes tangible goals and continual feedback. When studying professional violinists, Ericsson found that although all the violinists spent a similar number of hours practicing, the most accomplished among them were more purposeful: The most expert performers would ensure that a teacher regularly listened to and critiqued their playing, thus providing a feedback mechanism. They also asked their teachers to assign practice exercises they weren’t yet proficient at and worked on them until they became competent. In this way, they always had clear goals to work toward. So if you want to unleash your creative potential, don’t just practice the same skills over and over again in isolation. Make it your mission to continually develop skills and seek regular feedback. Why do we consider some people geniuses? Charles Darwin, for instance, is often considered a genius for discovering natural selection. But dig a little deeper into the history of his discovery, and all is not as it seems. Despite what you may have heard, Darwin was not the only person to develop the theory of natural selection. That honor also goes to one of Darwin’s contemporaries, Alfred Wallace. But unfortunately, history has all but forgotten Wallace, while Darwin is celebrated for his genius. This should give us pause for thought. Are those we deem geniuses really so unique and special? Arguably, there were other factors that give them their lauded status. Timing plays a big role when it comes to who society deems a genius. Indeed, the world remembers Charles Darwin more than it does Wallace because of Darwin’s canny sense of urgency. In 1858, upon hearing that Wallace was working on the very same theory that he was, Darwin quickly arranged for a presentation of his ideas to the Linnean Society – an important scientific institution – thereby appearing as if he were the primary driving force behind the theory of evolution. And Wallace? He was in no rush to take credit for what was as much his idea as it was Darwin’s, choosing instead to sail around the world for several more years before publishing his own account of the theory. By the time he finally returned home, Darwin’s 1859 book The Origin of The Species had already been published, and Darwin had written himself into the scientific history books forever. Timing also creates geniuses in a broader sense too, in that geniuses are inextricably linked to their historical context. Take the pop artist Andy Warhol – often considered one of the creative geniuses of the twentieth century. Imagine if he had created his masterpieces during the Italian Renaissance. Would he still have been thought of as a genius? It’s more likely he would have been labeled as a heretic and his works destroyed before future generations had a chance to appreciate them. Similarly, what if that genius of the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci, had completed his priceless paintings in the era of pop art. Far from being thought of as a creative genius, his work would have been considered hopelessly dated. Why? Because this form of artistic expression would’ve already been explored hundreds of years earlier. Therefore it’s important to recognize that geniuses are often a product of their time, rather than universally brilliant individuals. What makes us like some things, and turn away from others? The answer to this difficult question might be found by looking at the fortunes of a clothing brand. In 2009, popular tattoo artist Don Ed Hardy sold the rights to his designs to a fashion company, and soon Ed Hardy clothing became the must-have celebrity item. Before the end of the year, the brand had sold $700 million in clothes and accessories. Everyone everywhere seemed to be wearing Ed Hardy. But then something strange happened. By the end of 2009, Ed Hardy clothing had become an embarrassing cliché and sales had tanked. Why did it go so wrong? The fortunes of the Ed Hardy clothing brand are a perfect example of what the author has deemed the creative curve. The creative curve describes our paradoxical preference for both familiarity and novelty. Research indicates that the more familiar we are with something, the more we like it. For instance, researchers at the University of Michigan conducted a study in which participants were shown a number of made-up Chinese characters. They were told that each character represented either a positive or a negative adjective. Researchers then exposed participants to each of these characters either a greater or fewer number of times. When asked afterward, the participants overwhelmingly thought that the characters they’d seen more often represented something positive, while those they’d seen less often stood for something negative. The researchers concluded that the more familiar we are with something, the more positive associations we have with it. This explains the explosion in popularity of Hardy’s clothing brand throughout 2009. As people saw it more and more often, they developed positive associations with it, in turn driving up sales. But why did people stop buying Ed Hardy clothing as quickly as they did? This can be explained by the flipside of the creative curve – our desire for novelty. Researchers have discovered that in addition to our desire for familiarity, we also have a counter-desire for novelty. One study found that once participants had been played a song eight times, they began to like it less and less each time they heard it. This phenomenon explains the rise and fall of the Ed Hardy clothing brand. People liked the clothes more when they began to see them more often, but as soon as they became ubiquitous their desire for novelty kicked in, and they quickly ditched them. In 1982, a small video rental store in Arizona became wildly popular with film enthusiasts. But the long queues that formed every night weren’t down to its stellar selection of movies. The store was so popular because movie buffs wanted film recommendations from its 18-year-old clerk, Ted Sarandos. Fast forward 30 years and Ted Sarandos is now the chief content officer at Netflix – responsible for commissioning shows such as Stranger Things and Orange Is the New Black. Why have people always been so interested in Ted’s opinions? In fact, Ted Sarandos’ success is all thanks to his in-depth knowledge of the creative curve. As a college student working part-time in the video store, Ted decided to pass the time by watching each and every film in the well-stocked store. After several months of intense viewing, Ted became a walking recommendation machine. Customers would tell him what films they liked and Ted could give them any number of excellent suggestions in return. Through his massive consumption of films, Ted developed cultural awareness: a finely tuned knowledge of what films would feel familiar to his customers, which films were good and which were cliché. At the tender age of 18, Ted was skilled enough to know where a film would fit on the creative curve. Nowadays, Ted uses his knowledge of the creative curve to decide what sort of films and TV shows to commission for Netflix. He even acknowledges the creative curve himself, stating that the kind of content he looks out for are shows that have “one foot in familiarity and one foot in something really fresh, unknown, and novel.” And it’s not just film buffs who use mass consumption to build their knowledge of the creative curve. When the author conducted interviews with professionals from across the creative disciplines, including songwriters, painters and chefs, they all reported spending around one-fifth of their day – that’s roughly 3 or 4 hours – engaging in mass consumption of material related to their particular creative industry. Painters were continually attending art exhibitions, chefs carved out time to dine at exciting new restaurants and songwriters were constantly listening to music both new and old. So in order to reach the top of your creative game, be sure to spend about 20% of your time consuming the output of your chosen industry. After all, the insights you make might take you as far as Ted Sarandos. Ask around for long enough and you’ll soon find people who dream of writing a novel. But dig a little deeper, and you’ll also find that many of these folk would shy away from ever putting pen to paper. Why? Because they don’t think they have what it takes to become a successful author. Either they don’t think they have a way with words, or just don’t think they’re smart enough to manage it. But what if writing a successful novel had much less to do with writing ability or smarts than we assume, and everything to do with where the book falls on the creative curve? If this is true, then that spot on the bestseller list might not be so out of reach. Beverly Jenkins is a highly successful author whose success is largely thanks to her books’ winning combination of familiarity and novelty. That is, they fall right on the creative curve’s sweet spot. As a young girl, Jenkins loved to read just about anything she could get her hands on in the local library. But as an adult, when she got home from her mundane administrative job, she loved nothing more than settling down with a historical romance novel. Jenkins soon spotted a problem with her favorite genre: all the characters in these romances were white. In fact, in any of the popular romance books she read, none of the lovers were ever written as African-American. Despite having no prior writing experience, she quickly decided that she would be the author to fill this particular gap in the market. The rest, as they say, is history. These days, she’s known as the creator of a new genre of literature – black historical romance – and her books have sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.   The reason Jenkins’ books are so popular is because of their positioning on the creative curve. Firstly, they combine all the familiar elements of traditional romance novels: they never fail to provide a happy ending, and the lovers always reach a crisis point in their relationship before eventually reconciling. However, true to the rules of the creative curve, Jenkins’ books also bring something refreshingly novel to their readers. All her stories focus on African-American protagonists – a perspective that had been sorely lacking in the romance novels that came before. Next time you’re thinking of whether you really could write that book, think less about your writing talent and more about whether your idea hits the creative curve’s sweet spot. You just might be the next publishing sensation. When we think of a creative genius, we often imagine an inspired individual, feverishly working away. They might be slaving away on a creative project in a remote cabin, or in a futuristic office, but one thing’s for sure – the genius of our imagination usually works alone. This idea of the isolated genius is handed down to us through popular culture. Consider the character of Tony Stark – the hero of the Iron Man films – a solitary genius who single-handedly builds his eponymous robotic suits. But when we take a closer look at reality, our notions of the lone creative genius quickly fall apart. Creativity has a social component that’s often overlooked, but highly significant. In other words, it takes a community to make a creative genius. A 1992 study by researchers from the University of California looked at the social networks of thousands of innovators and scientists. Their findings showed that the quality of these social networks could predict the longevity and productivity of the innovators’ careers and predict how prominent they would be in their field. Additionally, research into high-achieving artists found that the quality of their reputations was directly associated to the number of relationships they had with other high-achieving artists. Successful artists who had more relationships with other successful artists had stronger reputations. Finally, research conducted in 1985 looking at a variety of world-renowned performers found that not one had honed their skills alone, but with a teacher who was both relentless and experienced. This research demonstrates what would be clear to see if one were to visit the offices of the man who is often posited as the real-life Tony Stark: Elon Musk. Musk is the founder of the technology companies Tesla and SpaceX. Far from being the lone creative genius we often assume, Musk has thousands of employees who enable his creation of futuristic cars, rockets and spaceships. So if you’re looking to become a world-class innovator, it pays to take a few talented friends, teachers or employees with you along the way. The key message in these blinks: We’re quick to mystify the notion of talent and eager to label a chosen few as geniuses, but the true nature of these concepts is less mysterious and more formulaic than conventional wisdom suggests. Community, great timing, a hefty dose of familiarity and a dash of novelty all contribute to what we recognize as creative genius. Actionable advice: Successful creatives need prominent promoters. If you want society to consider you a genius, you’ll need to do more than work hard and produce good work. You’ll also be needing a hefty amount of social recognition – society needs to believe that you and your work is credible. So you’ll need to take a particular kind of friend with you on your journey to success: a prominent promoter. This is someone who champions your work and introduces you to your target audience. Your friend should also be a credible creative force within that field too, so that when they begin to advocate on your behalf, other people will respect their judgement. Got feedback?

Sometimes those slumps can feel so deep that you wonder if you’ll ever get out of them. So imagine if you went on the bus one morning and the bus driver gave you a set of rules for escaping your slump. That’s what these blinks are about: the energy bus. Take a ride on an allegorical bus that gives you new ways to think positively and you’ll find yourself transforming both your personal and work life. Here you’ll find ten rules for giving your life an energy boost. In these blinks, you’ll find out what the formula E + P = O means and why it’s important; why you want to get rid of negative energy on your bus ride; and how CEO has a different meaning on the bus, and why you should become that CEO. For most people, “positive energy” means walking around with a pasted-on smile. However, truly positive energy runs much deeper; it’s a state of real optimism and enthusiasm that cultivates a lifestyle of trust, passion and love. It sounds great, but how can you reach that state? Well, take our fictional leading man in this story, George. His life seemed perfect; he had a house, a wife, two children, a puppy and a team to lead at the NRG Company, which manufactured light bulbs. Nevertheless, George was miserable. Every little thing seemed to go wrong for him, and he was desperate to find meaning in his life. Lots of people feel like George, trapped in the passenger seat of their own lives. After all, life is loaded with stress and impossible expectations, both personal and professional. One Monday morning, George discovered that his car had a flat tire. He was late to a meeting about the launch of a new light bulb, and his team descended into chaos. To make matters worse, that morning he’d had a vicious argument with his wife. Just one day in and he was already certain that it was going to be another terrible week. From there, it seemed like things only went downhill; George’s car also had a brake problem, and he had to take the bus to work for the next two weeks. However, when he climbed on board for the first time, he was immediately captivated by Joy the bus driver and her brimming smile. As it turned out, she had met many people like George and knew exactly what he needed. George learned from another passenger that, according to a study, Monday morning at 9 a.m. is the most common time for people to commit suicide. It’s the time when people feel they simply can’t go on with another week of their lives. George was dangerously close to this point and Joy knew she needed to intervene. So, she invited him on a once-in-a-lifetime journey: a trip to a happier life on the Energy Bus. Joy offered George an incredible opportunity, but it wasn’t until his wife and boss told him he was poised to lose everything that he was ready to accept it. Once he did, he committed to learning Joy’s ten rules for a new life. The first rule was: become the driver of your own bus and take back control. Here’s how his journey began. As George boarded the bus for another day at the office, Joy told him that people are often unhappy because they have no say in their lives. George immediately understood what she meant. After all, he felt trapped between conflicting expectations, like those of his boss and his wife. Not just that, but his life was full of events totally beyond his control, like the breakdown of his car. Joy went on to say that, according to the philosophy of the energy bus, to truly change your life, you need to take back control, decide who you want to be and how. But before you do that, you need to know where you’re going. That’s where the second rule comes in: with vision and focus, you can drive the bus in the direction you want.  To demonstrate this, Joy asked George to write down a vision for his personal life, one for his job and one for his family. George decided that he wanted to be happy again; he wanted to have a positive influence on his kids and for his wife to be happy. His primary goal at work was to have a successful product launch with his team. Now all that was left was to achieve these goals. To help, Joy told George about the law of attraction. According to this concept, all thoughts are magnetic, which means the things you think about will begin showing up in your life. Just take Olympic athletes, many of whom use the law of attraction by visualizing their best performances before entering a competition. Often this results in gold-medal wins. Realizing this powerful potential, George resolved to spend ten minutes a day thinking about his goals. Everybody knows that it can be difficult to focus on the positive, but working on your attitude and outlook on the world can make all the difference. Your perception of events is entirely within your control. Just take the formula E + P = O. It says that Events + Perception/Positive Energy = Outcome. In other words, there are lots of things you’ve got no control over, but what you do control is how you perceive those events. So, by choosing to have positive thoughts, rather than negative ones, you can achieve better results. This is key since positive energy will keep your bus moving forward. This is rule number three: positive energy is the fuel for your journey. But how can you keep that fuel tank topped up? Sometimes it just requires approaching things from a different perspective. If you have a lot of work to do, it can help to feel grateful for having a job in the first place, knowing that lots of people struggle to get work at all. Such a simple act of gratitude will release endorphins and make you feel better before you know it. George decided to try this practice out for himself by spending ten minutes walking around the office, considering all that he has to be grateful for. He realized that he’s healthy, has a loving family, a home and a job – much more than most people. After this walk he felt a newfound sense of energy and could get back to work, ready to face all the challenges of the day. You can follow George’s example. Just make these little pieces of practice part of your daily routine, offering yourself opportunities to recharge and reenergize as you do. Whether it’s at work with your colleagues or at home with your partner, happiness and success often rely on teamwork. After all, a happy family life and a successful work environment can only be achieved when everyone does their part. So, as George began to realize his vision in life, he started to get worried; if he was the only one approaching his work with passion and energy, it was unlikely that he’d be able to pull off a successful product launch or improve his marriage. Luckily, Joy was on hand with rule number four: tell others about your vision and ask them to join you. It’s simple: the more people you get on your bus, the more positive energy you’ll have to fuel your ride and the more successful your results will be. To make this a reality, Joy told George about an easy-to-use website that could help him tell other passengers about his plans. It’s called theenergybus.com, and by using it, George could print out bus tickets to give to his wife and everyone on his team at work. But a ticket isn’t much good if passengers don’t first understand where they’re going. While George was excited about the idea, he also knew from speaking with Joy that it was important to personally hand each potential passenger a ticket, but only after discussing the upcoming journey. That’s because, if people don’t know where you're headed, they won’t be so keen to hop on board. With this knowledge in mind, George met with each member of his team individually, handing out invitations to share his vision. In those meetings, he laid out his expectations for the launch and asked everyone to commit to the vision. His employees had all weekend to consider their conversations and let him know on Monday if they were going to come along for the ride. George felt energized by the prospect of adding new travel companions. But he was also nervous that they might disappoint him. To avoid this, his vision would need to have enough power to inspire others, something you’ll learn all about in the next blink. When George met with his team again, he was shocked to hear that one team member, José, didn’t want a seat on the bus. George was surprised because José was one of his best employees. This unexpected development made George question his vision; how could he succeed if others didn’t want to help him? Well, it’s actually less important than George might think. If people don’t want to get on the bus, you shouldn’t try to convince them. Just take a Gallup poll which found that there are around 22 million workers in the United States who hold a negative attitude toward work. These employees are responsible for an annual loss in productivity of around $300 billion. Naturally, being surrounded by people with such negative attitudes can fuel self-doubt and prevent you from realizing your goals. So, to handle his situation, Joy told George about rule number five: save your energy and don’t try to convince people who aren’t ready to get on board. Just remember, if they’re full of negativity, they’ll only slow you down. And if negative people do get on your bus, it’s essential to remove them as soon as you can. You might notice passengers who complain along the way. You can think of these people as vampires who suck out your positivity and vision. That’s why rule number six is to get Energy Vampires off of your bus. To put it another way, if you have negative people on your team, sit them down and have a talk. Try to determine where their negative attitude comes from and how you can work together. If they’re unwilling to change, you have to let them go. Or, in situations where you can’t get rid of problematic people, say your boss or supervisor, find ways to boost your own positive energy. If you can, you’ll outweigh the negativity they bring into your life. Have you ever known someone who gets ridiculously excited about new albums or movies? Have you noticed that seeing such an energetic person describe their passion fills you with excitement and happiness as well? It’s only a natural response. After all, the human body can sense the emotions of others. Just take a study from the Institute of HeartMath, an American research and education institution that specializes in the way the heart influences well-being. Their research found that the heart can transmit emotions through its own electromagnetic field. Not just that, but such a field can be sensed from a distance of up to ten feet! In other words, people around us can perceive the way we feel and respond to it. That’s why people can tell when someone is insincere. But it also means that when people are truly passionate about something, they share that enthusiasm and those positive emotions with others. Because of this, it’s key to energize your whole bus, but when you do so, it’s also important it’s done with true enthusiasm. This is where rule number seven comes in: enthusiasm will make more people join you and motivate them along the ride. In fact, the word “enthusiasm” comes from the Greek word entheos, meaning “inspired” or “filled with the divine.” As long as you’re excited about your work and the tasks you’re doing, everyone around you will feel the same. This is the kind of positive energy you need to fuel your ride for the long haul. Joy even has a name for it: your CEO or Chief Energy Officer. People who fill this role infect their team members, employees and even customers with powerful positive energy that inspires and propels them. You’ve probably noticed that you work harder when others recognize your efforts and care about you. It seems obvious, but it points to a deeper human need for appreciation. In other words, by loving your team members, you can make them feel good, but also motivate them to do their best work and follow you wherever you go. That’s why rule number eight is to love the passengers on your bus. Here’s how. First, be sure to take your time and listen. Remember, love and relationships need a while to develop and blossom. So, just as you need to spend time with your partner to build your relationship, you’ve got to spend time with your employees. Regular individual meetings are essential; they offer an opportunity for you to get to know your team personally. In these meetings, you should listen carefully to what the other person says and show empathy for their experience. Your employees should know that you care both about their needs and their ideas. From there, it’s also important to recognize your employees as individuals and show them how much you appreciate their work. This one is a no-brainer since people want to be seen as individuals, not robots. So, show your workers that they’re more than a cog in a machine. For instance, you should never send an electronic birthday message. Rather, write out real birthday cards for each person on your team. And finally, be sure to recognize the individual accomplishments of every employee you manage. Just take George and his employee José, who didn’t want to get on the bus. José never felt valued and, even though he regularly worked late, George never recognized it. Adding insult to injury, when José asked for a raise, George said he would think about it but never brought it up again. But that was the old George. The first thing the new George did after learning about rule number eight was to thank José for all his great work and promise him a raise. As a result, José was happy to join George on the energy bus. By implementing all the rules you’ve learned so far, George managed to get his marriage back on track and spend more time than ever with his kids. However, as his product launch approached, George wondered how he could inject another shot of energy into his team. To do so, he needed to understand that purpose makes his work easier. A story about President Johnson and a janitor at NASA offers a great example. The president was visiting the space program when he encountered a custodian enthusiastically cleaning the floors. The president told the man that he was probably the best janitor he had ever met, to which the janitor responded, “Sir, I’m not a janitor. I just helped put a man on the moon.” It just goes to show that, with a higher purpose, you can easily accomplish everyday tasks, and that’s why rule number nine is to let yourself be driven by a higher purpose. George got his team to see themselves as creators of not just light bulbs, but light – the kind of people who can illuminate the first book a child reads. Once they made this decision, they all happily worked late nights alongside George. Suddenly, the whole team was united behind their shared mission. But most importantly, purpose and fun can enable stellar performances. Another passenger on George’s morning commute told him about a study involving two teams, each of which was tasked with designing a new airplane. One of them was told that they were chosen to design the best airplane that ever existed, while the other was told to simply design components and denied any information about the mission behind the project. Unsurprisingly, the team with the mission had a better time and worked harder, completing their job in half the time. This example points to the last rule, number ten: you have got to have fun on your ride. After all, success is much easier to attain when you’re enjoying yourself, rather than stressing out. The key message in this book: The modern world is overloaded with competing pressures from the stress of work to the demands of family life and the general difficulty of paying bills, maintaining your house and holding everything together. But there’s a solution: positive energy can help you take back control and find true happiness. Actionable advice: Learn from your setbacks. Making sure your bus arrives at its destination can be hard work. To get where you want to go, you’ll need to be able to handle all the setbacks and challenges along the way. To do so, make a habit of asking yourself what you can learn from such difficulties. What opportunities do they present to you and your team? By thinking productively about all the roadblocks, the road to your vision will be all the smoother. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Just seven years later, in 2008, she was a multimillionaire who had sold her first company for $30 million. Having achieved her goals, she decided that she wanted to help other entrepreneurs achieve them as well. To that end, she became an angel investor – a person who provides investment capital to start-up companies. In the course of investing in more than 70 companies, she has observed that the crucial factor that turns entrepreneurial dreams into successful realities is the ability to execute – to carry out a plan of action. This execution factor, in turn, depends on five traits, all of which can be developed by anyone willing to put in the work such development requires. These blinks explore the five traits of execution – taking each in turn, explaining some general principles to deepen your understanding of them and then discussing some specific, practical techniques for mastering them. Along the way, you’ll learn how to refine an idea into a vision; how to take the first step toward pursuing that vision; and how to become more resilient in your pursuit of that vision. In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, the United States found itself falling behind the Soviet Union in the space race. The Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first human to reach outer space, beating the United States to that accomplishment. So to spur his country into action, President John F. Kennedy made a bold proclamation: by the end of the decade, the United States would land an American astronaut on the Moon.   In making this proclamation, Kennedy was articulating a vision – an ambitious, visualizable and inspiring aspiration for the future. Having a vision is the first trait of effective execution. In Kennedy’s case, it was a vision for an entire nation, but you, too, can have visions for yourself, your career or the company you’re working for or want to start. Bringing our analogies back down to earth, while still keeping an eye on the heavens above, you can think of your vision as being akin to the North Star that once helped sailors navigate the seas. Like that celestial body, a vision provides you with a reference point that can help you navigate life’s choppy waters and unexpected waves. Those “waves” are the events, setbacks and competing pressures that can distract you from pursuing your dreams. By keeping your mind’s eye fixed on your vision, you can stay focused on your life’s work and maintain your direction toward your desired destination, even during tough times. That destination is the future you envision for yourself. It can take many forms. It could be a purpose you give to your life, such as having a positive impact on the environment. It could be a vocation, like cooking. Or it could be a personal goal, like purchasing a home, starting a business or completing a marathon. Whatever your destination, you will likely find yourself taken in unexpected directions as you pursue your vision, especially if it involves a more general goal that can be achieved in various ways, such as financial freedom. For instance, the author’s first business was a digital-marketing company that sold a motley assortment of products – ranging from teeth whiteners to remote-control toys. Was this the precise future she envisioned for herself when she was younger? Of course not – but it was part of the path that led her to achieve financial freedom. You’ll never know exactly where your vision will take you until you get there! If you don’t already have one, how do you develop a vision for yourself? Well, most of us have ideas about things we might want to do or achieve some day. These ideas provide us with the raw material for a grand vision – but to turn those little sparks of imagination into a guiding North Star, we need to refine them. For starters, all visions have four qualities. The first quality is clarity. You should be able to clearly articulate your vision in a single sentence, and, in your mind’s eye, you should be able to clearly see it coming to fruition. If you can’t do either of these things, then go back to the drawing board and refine your vision. Now, achieving clarity might seem easy, especially if your vision involves a specific goal or vocation, such as having financial freedom or running a food truck. After all, can’t anyone picture herself flush with cash or cooking curbside?   Here’s the thing, though: to really achieve clarity, your imagination must be specific. For instance, for running a food truck, picture not just a vague, general image of wearing a chef’s hat and frying food, but a gritty, detailed image of working during mealtime hours, ordering workers around, dealing with disgruntled customers and so forth. In other words, you must ask yourself and honestly answer the question, “Could I really see myself doing this?” That brings us to the other three characteristics of a viable vision, each of which is related and has to do with whether a vision is an authentic expression of yourself. To be such an expression, a vision should be compelling, meaningful and pertinent to you – in other words, it should fit your values, preferences, desires and personality. Visions that fall short of these criteria are often expressions of other people’s visions for you. Consider Darren – a maintenance manager of a hospital who was renowned among his friends and colleagues for the chili he made. They kept telling him that he should start a food truck to profit off his chili. He wasn’t really interested, but their suggestion stuck in his head. He ended up quitting his job and starting a food truck – only to find it made him miserable. He liked cooking for friends and colleagues; he didn’t like cooking for strangers. We’ll look at how to avoid a similar fate in the next blink. How do you avoid pursuing a vision that’s at odds with who you really are? How do you make sure your vision is really your vision, and not someone else’s vision for you? One way is to test out your vision on a smaller scale, before you fully commit. For example, if you enjoy cooking for your friends and were thinking about starting a food truck, you could try participating in a cook-off contest. That way, you’d gain a relatively risk-free experience of cooking for strangers, which may feel very different than cooking for friends. You might love it, or you might hate it. If the latter turns out to be true, that might be disappointing – but better to find out by entering a one-time, no-stakes contest than by quitting your job and investing in a food truck!   Now, once you’ve determined that your vision truly is in line with who you are, the next step is to stay focused on it. The more vivid your image of the future is, the easier it will be to focus on it, so one thing to do is to visualize it in concrete, evocative detail. Here’s a trick for doing this: picture yourself having already achieved your vision. What do you see? Ask yourself specific questions to generate specific answers. For instance, if your vision is starting a business, what does your workplace look like? What kinds of people comprise your team of workers? What do you see yourself doing on a day-to-day basis? To remind yourself about your vision, write it down in a place where you’ll see it every day, such as your bathroom mirror. Then, keep it in mind as you plan your day. Make sure you’re pursuing and prioritizing tasks that provide stepping stones to achieve  your vision. After all, you can cross off every item on your to-do list, but it won’t bring you one step closer to your overarching goal if they’re not related to it! Prioritizing tasks that are related to achieving your vision may entail de-prioritizing or even outright avoiding other activities that you enjoy, especially those that are totally optional, such as watching television. After all, time is a finite resource, so to ensure you devote enough of it to working toward your vision, you have to be selective about the ways you spend it. By defining your vision, you’ve answered the question, “What do you want to execute?” Now the question becomes, “How do you execute it?” This brings us to the second trait of effective execution, which is passion. When you hear that word, the first thing that probably comes to mind is a strong, enthusiastic emotion, as in the sentence, “John has a passion for marketing.” However, that’s only one sense of the term; there’s another sense that’s also relevant here. It goes back to the etymology of “passion,” which derives from the Latin word pati, meaning “to suffer or endure.” In this sense of the term, passion is not just about doing things fervently because you love doing them; it’s about loving them so much that you’re willing to undergo hardship and make sacrifices for them. Such willingness is the true test of passion. For instance, when the author was a girl, she wanted to ride horses so badly that she agreed to clean out a horse owner’s stables in exchange for lessons. In other words, her passion for horseback riding was so strong that she was willing to scoop up horse excrement to pursue it! Why is passion in this sense so important? Well, unless you narrowly define success as just making money and you luck out by winning the lottery, there are no easy shortcuts to achieving it. There will inevitably be hard work, stressful events and inconveniences, such as taking conference calls when you’re sick, missing social engagements for business trips or putting personal finances on the line. If you want to succeed, you can’t avoid making sacrifices like these; all you can do is be willing to endure them – and that willingness comes from passion. Your passion provides you with the emotional energy you’ll need in order to power through the long workdays and sleepless nights that lie ahead of you on your journey toward success.   It’s also an important factor in finding other people to help you on your journey. By demonstrating a willingness to make sacrifices for your cause, you can position yourself as an inspiring leader to your colleagues or employees. Asking whether potential or current colleagues or employees share your passion can also help you to choose the people you associate with. In the next blink, we’ll look at ways to kindle and feed your passion. To tap into the power of passion, you first have to know what you’re passionate about. If you don’t already have a clear conception of this, ask yourself the following: What do you love so much that you’d be willing to make significant sacrifices for it? Maybe it’s a subject, such as fashion or animals. Maybe it’s a skill or activity, such as writing or painting. Or perhaps it’s a role, such as being a teacher or a caretaker. Whatever it is, here’s your next question: What are you doing on a regular basis that’s feeding your passion? If the answer is nothing, the next step is to change that!   You can start small. The idea is just to get your feet wet and do something – anything – to become more connected to your passion. For instance, if it were fashion, you wouldn’t have to go out and become a designer right away; you could just start a fashion blog! However, you won’t be able to write even a single blog post or take any other small steps toward feeding your passion if you don’t make time for it. As with your vision, you have to prioritize your passion and carve out a space for it in your schedule. And that means making trade-offs. To accomplish tasks that are related to your passion, you’ll have to sacrifice tasks that aren’t related to it. That may require declining invitations to social engagements, such as parties and dinners, which may be scheduled at times that conflict with your pursuit of your passion. To mitigate the disappointment of your friends, colleagues or family members, you should communicate to them the rationale behind your absences. You can also compensate them for those absences by offering alternatives, such as one-on-one meetings or small group get-togethers, which you can schedule around your pursuit of your passion. While you pursue it, you can further encourage your passion by celebrating your successes, both big and small. For instance, when one of the author’s companies achieved its first month of earning $1 million in revenue, she celebrated by taking her entire team to Las Vegas! That’s an example of celebrating a huge accomplishment in a big way – but small victories, such as closing a business deal, deserve small celebrations, too. Try literally feeding your passion by treating yourself or your team to a dinner! Once you’ve found your vision and your passion, you’re like a driver with a destination in your mind and a full tank of gas in your car. You’re ready to head out – but you won’t actually go anywhere until you put your foot down on the accelerator pedal. That’s the third trait of effective execution: action. Suffice it to say that no one ever accomplished anything without taking action, which, in this context, means doing something that takes you closer to following your passion and achieving your vision. Assuming you’ve been able to articulate your vision and are ready to take action, the first question you’re going to face is, “Where do I begin?” After all, there are many possible paths of action you can take. Which one do you choose? Well, don’t overthink it. Otherwise, you could find yourself stuck in analysis paralysis, which is the condition that occurs when you get so caught up in mulling over your options and all of their possible ramifications that you become overwhelmed, leading to inaction. Just do something. Move forward. You don’t need to commit to any particular path at this point; just pick one of them and take a first step. You can still reassess, change direction or even back out before you proceed further, so there’s no need to overanalyze. But that’s not to say you should act thoughtlessly. Remember, it’s just a step you’re taking here – not a leap. Don’t quit your job and put your livelihood on the line. Instead, keep your current job while turning your vision and passion into a side hustle. Consider Stacey. She worked in corporate finance, but her true passion was health and wellness. From this passion, she developed a vision: starting a juice company. But she didn’t quit her job, tap into her savings and jump straight into the high-risk enterprise of establishing a new business. Instead, she took a safer, smaller first step: selling juice at a farmer’s market on the weekends. This way, she could get a better sense of whether she enjoyed the work of selling juice and whether there was a market for her product. So that’s the first step. We’ll look at the steps that follow in the next blink. What comes after you take your first step of action toward following your passion and achieving your vision? Well, this might sound glib, but the answer is pretty simple: after your first step comes your second step – and then your third step, your fourth step and so forth! Obvious as this may be, it does bring up a less obvious consideration that’s important to bear in mind: your first step may be a great success – but to keep moving toward your vision, you have to, well, keep moving. If you just keep taking the same step over and over again, you’re not going to get anywhere. The same logic applies to the second step and every step after that. At every step along the way, you need to keep moving forward to make progress. Apple provides a vivid example of the importance of continuing to move forward. Apple is one of the top brands in the world, but its success didn’t hinge on being the first company to develop technologies such as MP3 players and smartphones. Other companies beat them to those innovations. Rather, Apple took these preexisting technologies and relentlessly innovated them. The company never rested on its laurels; it didn’t let itself get too comfortable in any particular step along the way of its journey. After developing the first iPhone and iPod, it went straight on to developing their follow-ups – and then the follow-ups to the follow-ups, and so forth. However, while moving forward is crucial to success, it’s also a double-edged sword. If you’re heading in the right direction, it will get you closer to achieving your vision – but, by the same token, if you’re heading in the wrong direction, it will take you further away. To avoid the latter prospect, it’s important to create and implement a daily review process. First, write down a list of all of the actions you took today that were related to your vision. Did they really align with your vision? Did they really take you closer to achieving it? Are they feeding your passion? What direction are they taking you – and is that in a direction you still want to go? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then it’s time to reassess what you’re doing and change your course of action! The fourth trait of effective execution involves another word with two meanings: resilience.  Here’s the first meaning: if someone or something is resilient, that means that he, she or it can withstand the turbulent winds of fate. For instance, if a building can weather the literal winds of a hurricane, it would be labeled as resilient.  But in another sense of the term, a resilient person not only withstands the winds of fate, but also harnesses them to the best of her ability – as a sailor does with her sails. She knows that while she can’t control the direction of the wind, she can control the direction in which she points her sails. The uncooperative “wind” in this metaphor stands for the challenges, crises and setbacks that the world may throw your way when you’re pursuing your vision. If you’re resilient in both senses of the word, you’ll not only take these difficulties in stride; you’ll also respond to them in ways that lead to growth. And one of the main ways that you can do that is by staying positive, as well as hopeful and hungry for new opportunities. That was one of the keys to billionaire Elon Musk’s bumpy road to success. Today, you may know him as the successful CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and a cofounder of PayPal. But before he succeeded, he faced many setbacks. His first business idea for PayPal floundered, and some of his SpaceX rockets literally went up in smoke. But he didn’t give up; he kept trying to succeed – and eventually, PayPal and his SpaceX rockets took off, literally and figuratively. That’s an example of resiliency in the sense of withstanding setbacks. But Elon Musk also provides an example of resiliency in the other sense of the term: not just withstanding setbacks, but also growing from them.   For instance, in 2017, when reports came out about the high rate of injury at his Tesla factory in Fremont, Musk made some unusual public pledges to his employees. One of them was that he would have one-on-one meetings with injured workers to learn about problems on the factory’s production line. Not only that, he would then perform their tasks himself to experience those problems firsthand. Thus, he turned the problems into a learning opportunity. We’ll look at how to cultivate your own inner Elon Musk in the next blink. So how do you become more resilient? Well, you can think of your resiliency as a mental muscle – something that, just like a physical muscle, can be developed with exercise. But first, it helps to stretch and relax the muscle. That means taking care of yourself emotionally, so you can alleviate your stress, anxiety and fear. This will allow you to be calmer in the face of adversity, which will help you make better decisions. Simple ways to do this include physical exercise, meditation, journaling, creating an action plan and talking things out with a friend or mentor. In the aftermath of situations that destabilize your mind with negative emotions, these activities can help you to restabilize. In a similar vein, you can also reconnect to aspects of your life that have a stabilizing effect on you. For example, even in the midst of professional turmoil, the author finds a sense of calm when playing with her children. So those are some ways you can stretch and relax your resiliency muscle. Now let’s look at the exercise part. One beneficial technique is to turn everyday setbacks into opportunities for exercise. For instance, the author once bought tickets to a Guns N’ Roses stadium concert for herself and a group of 20 colleagues. She thought it would be a great bonding experience. There was just one problem: it turned out that all of the seats were in different parts of the stadium! But rather than gnash her teeth at the setback, she decided to turn it into an opportunity for teamwork. She proposed that each member of the group try to trade their seats with a stranger, and then trade that new seat for another seat with a second stranger, and so forth and so on, until they were all sitting together. Not only did this gambit work, saving their concert experience; it also made that experience even richer than it would have otherwise been. Instead of just rocking out to songs like “Paradise City,” they also got to share a memorable team-building exercise and bonding experience. So next time a little adversity knocks down your building blocks, see if you can make a game out of rebuilding them into your own “Paradise City”! The fifth and final trait that leads to effective execution is the most decisive one of all. You can have the clearest, most compelling vision in the world, and you can pursue it with relentless passion, action and resilience – but you’re not going to get very far if you try to do everything alone. You need the help of other people, and that’s what the final trait is all about: relationships.   As the old saying goes, no man (or woman) is an island. All of us have limited time, energy, skills and knowledge. But by pooling these precious resources together, we can expand the range of what we can accomplish. If someone else lends you some of her time and energy, you’ll have more overall time and energy to expend on pursuing your vision. If someone lends you her skills and knowledge, you can fill in some of the gaps in your own skills and knowledge. And, of course, this goes both ways, leading to the potential for win-win relationships. The more of these relationships you establish and maintain, and the deeper those relationships become, the more you’ll be able benefit from the power of having other people in your life. It’s therefore crucial to cultivate a network of people with whom you can enjoy win-win relationships. To expand your network, look for people outside your immediate social vicinity. For example, if you work in a corporate environment, look for people not just outside your team, but also outside your company or even your industry. To deepen your relationships, take the time to show a sincere interest in getting to know these people better. Don’t just ask routine questions with yes-or-no answers, like “Did you have a good weekend?” Instead, ask deeper, open-ended questions, like “Where do you envision yourself in five years?” or “What’s your passion?” To maintain your relationships, make a habit of showing people appreciation through nice, thoughtful gestures. Emails saying “thank you” and “congratulations” are one good way of doing this – but handwritten notes are even better, since they feel more personal. And when you have spare moments, such as when you’re driving to work or riding in a taxi, you can use the time to reconnect with people by phone. However, not all relationships are worth maintaining – a topic we’ll turn to in the last blink. The ideal relationship is one that’s win-win, where both parties mutually benefit from each other. Sadly, however, many relationships are win-lose or even lose-lose. What’s more, some relationships that were once win-win descend into negative territory. In light of these facts, the author recommends conducting a periodic life audit of your relationships. Once a year, she sits down and reviews all of her relationships one-by-one, splitting them into two categories. The first category consists of positive people from whom she receives inspiration, support, energy and challenges that lead her to grow. The other category consists of negative people from whom she receives the opposite effects. It may sound cold, but she then makes a conscious decision to distance herself from the people she has placed in the second category. Moving forward, she spends less time with them or even cuts herself off from them if need be. Of course, some issues can be worked through, so she isn’t quick to write people off. She only places them in the second category if the issues seem intractable, at least for the foreseeable future. In the longer-term future, the person may change, in which case he can be welcomed back into the first category. She also recognizes that people can become temporarily negative because of difficult experiences, such as illness, the death of a loved one or a job loss. She refrains from placing these people into the negative category, since she knows they need the help of her own positivity to pull through to the other side and return to a more positive state of being. Finally, she also recognizes that in a workplace setting, you can’t just stop talking to a “coworker who has a negative effect on you.” Since you’re stuck working with them, you have to figure out a way of interacting with them to the best of your ability and minimizing the negativity as much as possible. However, with other relationships, you have more choice in the matter, and the author recommends taking advantage of that freedom. The point isn’t to eliminate all negativity from your life. That’s impossible. It’s simply to maximize the positivity and minimize the negativity, so that you can put yourself in a position to actively, resiliently and collaboratively pursue your passion and execute your vision so that it becomes a reality. The key message in these blinks: The execution factor is your ability to carry out plans of action that enable you to achieve your goals. It rests upon five traits: vision, passion, action, resilience and relationships. Each of these traits can be cultivated. Execution is therefore a skill that you can develop, enabling you to put yourself in a position to succeed.   Actionable advice: Practice applying the ideas of these blinks by conducting thought experiments. When beginning your journey toward developing the five traits described in these blinks, the author recommends starting with a simple exercise: imagine someone else who’s having a problem with one of the traits, and think about what kind of advice you would give her. For instance, imagine you have a friend who wants to quit her job and start her own company – but she just has a vague idea of what she wants to do, and she isn’t really prepared to pursue it. She doesn’t have a business plan, her savings are limited and she has a family to support. What would you advise her to do? You can do similar exercises with the other four traits. The exercises can help you to get the ball rolling with applying the ideas of these blinks to real-life scenarios, since it’s often easier to give advice to someone else than yourself. After all, to give advice, you need to be able to step back from a problem, establish some critical distance from it and then evaluate it from an outside-the-box perspective, which can be difficult to do with a personal problem that you’re psychologically tangled up with.

Maybe you wish you’d started studying the violin ten years ago when you had more time, or kick yourself for not mastering a foreign language at a young age when it was easier. But what if, instead of regretting missed opportunities, you simply started working toward your goals today? This is where the author’s technique comes into play. In these blinks, you’ll learn how, in just 20 hours, you can master the basics of your desired skill. From scheduling practice time to acquiring all the tools you need to succeed, you’ll learn how to lay a solid foundation for obtaining any skill. In these blinks, you’ll find out what a difference 20 hours can make; why you’ll never just find time to practice; and that quantity sometimes is better than quality. Is there some skill you’ve always wanted to learn but never had the time for? Many people wish they could play the piano, dominate on the tennis court or converse in fluent French, and may even undertake to learn these skills. But often they give up before they’ve even acquainted themselves with the basics. The reason is that they believe it’s too late for them to acquire a new skill – but that’s simply not true! This is where rapid skill acquisition comes into play. By employing this technique, you can become fairly good at whatever skill you choose by putting in a mere 20 hours of practice. Obviously, if your aim is to become the next Serena Williams, you’ll need many thousands of hours of work. Rapid skill acquisition is more about covering the basics, rather than transforming yourself into an instant expert. But even those first 20 hours of practice on the court will already enable you to play against friends and maybe even partake in local tournaments. Let’s continue with the example of tennis. If you practice for 20 hours, breaking that time up into daily doses of 60-90 minutes, you’ll soon find yourself rapidly improving. And once you’ve completed the initial 20 hours of practice, it’ll become considerably easier to continue developing your chosen skill. If you’ve ever tried to learn something new, you’ll know that the first few hours of practice are often the hardest. At this stage, you’ll be more likely to get confused and run into problems, which is what causes people to give up early on. But it’s essential to persist for at least 20 hours. That way, you’ll have already reached a substantial level of skill, which will make further practice less problematic. So how can you make those 20 hours really count? Let’s dive into the ten principles underlying rapid skill acquisition. There are no doubt many skills you’d like to acquire, but an important part of skill acquisition is to choose the one you care about the most. So make a list of all the skills you want to work on and pick the one that you feel most excited about at that present moment. This will help keep up your motivation to practice. The author did just this when faced with the choice of which skill to pursue next. Windsurfing was on his list, but he hadn’t been in the sea for years, even though he had previously been a water-sports teacher at a Boy Scout’s camp. But since he’d had an innate passion for aquatic activities since childhood, he quickly got excited about windsurfing helping bring him back to the element he missed. The second principle of rapid skill acquisition claims that you should focus exclusively on one skill. It’s very tempting to try and learn several skills simultaneously; for instance, you may want to combine learning windsurfing with studying Spanish and how to play the ukulele. But this is not a good idea. You need to use your time wisely when learning something new because you likely don’t have much more than an hour or two a day. So don’t try to learn multiple skills simultaneously. If you do attempt to study multiple things at once, you’ll progress very slowly, which will only demotivate you. The third principle of rapid skill acquisition is all about deciding how good you want to become at your chosen endeavor. This is referred to as your target performance level, and it’s important because if you can imagine what you want your performance to look like, you’ll have an easier time getting there. So ask yourself what level of performance constitutes “good enough” for you. For instance, if you’re learning to play the banjo, do you want to play three tunes by heart, or to seamlessly join in a jam session? When the author started to learn how to play the ukulele, his target performance level was that he wanted to play at a conference his friend was organizing. As he had been asked to give a talk about rapid skill acquisition, he thought a perfect way to illustrate the concept was to demonstrate how much progress he’d made on the ukulele in a mere ten days. The fourth principle of rapid skill acquisition is to break up your desired skill up into smaller parts that you can tackle individually. You don’t try to down a whole meal in one bite, and you shouldn’t try to learn a whole skill all at once either. By dividing it up into sub-skills, progress will be easier and faster. In the author’s case, when he began to study the ukulele, he first analyzed the anatomy of the instrument. He then learned how to tune it and only then began to learn the chords for the song he planned to play at the conference. By the time it was time for his performance, he was able to play the song flawlessly. So you’ve decided on your chosen skill – but what tools do you need to pursue it? Ensuring you have the tools you need is the fifth principle of rapid skill acquisition. This step is rather straightforward – if you want to learn how to play tennis, you need a racket, and if you want to learn how to operate a helicopter, you need access to one. Though simple, it is essential to figure out which components, environments and tools you’ll need in order to practice and learn. This is what the author did when he started learning how to windsurf. Obviously, he needed a board but also a helmet and a wetsuit. And later, he discovered that before he could start using a sail, he had to get more comfortable simply standing on a board, meaning he needed a paddleboard and a paddle. Principle number six is about identifying the barriers that might interfere with acquiring your desired skill. Are there any emotional roadblocks, like fear or self-doubt that could hold you back? And what about distractions that might prevent you from practicing, such as a ringing phone? If there are any hindrances, try to eliminate them. For example, you can create a peaceful environment by shutting out any distractions while identifying and working through your fears. When the author started windsurfing, he was concerned that it would be dangerous – the risk of drowning and hypothermia had to be considered. In order to rid himself of those mental barriers, he familiarized himself with the dangers. He learned about dangerously low water temperatures and bought himself a suitable wetsuit. He also decided to always have someone else present when he was windsurfing – even if the person just sat on the shore. This way, there would always be help available if he was in danger. Nowadays, people lead busier lives than ever, which is why it’s important not just to try to find the time to practice but to make it. This is the seventh principle of rapid skill acquisition. In order to make time to practice the skill you wish to acquire, identify other activities in your life that you’re not particularly fond of, or during which you tend to stall or feel restless, and then work on cutting those out of your day. This will free up time with the goal of dedicating 60-90 minutes every day to working on your desired skill. The eighth principle of rapid skill acquisition is that you need to ensure you get feedback on your progress. Say you’re trying to learn Chinese. You need a way of getting fast feedback to be able to assess how you’re progressing and so you can adjust if you’ve gone wrong somewhere. If you can, hire a coach, as they can give you feedback almost instantly. Or, if you’re learning a new language, you could also use equipment such as a voice recorder, which will make it easier for you to spot your own pronunciation and grammatical mistakes. In the case of the author, he received feedback while learning how to play the game Go. He downloaded a piece of software called SmartGo, which provides feedback every time a move is made. This helped him quickly learn how he was doing and made it easier for him to identify his weak spots. Everyone dreads Mondays because they seem never-ending. After the pleasures of the weekend, it’s torture to have to endure an entire day of work. Indeed, engaging in any difficult or tedious activity for an extended period of time is both draining and inefficient – and that’s why you should only practice in short intervals. The ninth principle states that practicing in short spurts is the best way to make progress. When you start learning a new skill, the time you spend practicing can feel like it’s going very slowly. In fact, at the very beginning, people tend to overestimate how much time they’ve spent practicing because the task often feels so arduous. To get around this, use a timer to set 20-minute time frames for yourself. That way, you’ll know exactly how long you’ve spent practicing, and you’ll feel more motivated to do your best for that period of time. Aim to do three to five of these 20-minute blocks throughout the day, on a daily basis, and you’ll be astounded at how quickly you progress. The tenth and final principle of rapid skill acquisition is to focus on practicing a lot and quickly, not on attaining perfection. As a beginner, you’re not going to be an expert from the very start, so you should focus on practicing a whole lot, quickly. If you prioritize quantity and speed, you’ll find that you’re less likely to become irritated and demotivated due to the inevitable setbacks you’ll encounter. The author took this approach when he first started to learn how to windsurf. When he initially got on the board, he was far from perfect – in fact, as soon as he pulled up the sail, he fell into the water. He lost his glasses, nearly gave himself a concussion and swallowed an unpleasantly large gulp of water. If he had expected perfection from the very beginning, he probably would have given up right then and there. Instead, he focused on getting as much practice in as possible before the season was over and as a result, rapidly picked up this new and rewarding hobby that had seemed so daunting before. By keeping the ten principles of rapid skill acquisition in mind, you can successfully undertake a new skill in no time. Find your equivalent of windsurfing, and embark on your learning journey today! The key message in this book: It’s never too late to learn a new skill. All you need to do is keep the ten principles of rapid skill acquisition in mind. Whether you aim to learn French or play the ukulele, all you have to do is practice for an initial 20 hours, and you’ll be well on your way to proficiency. Actionable advice: Use a logbook to find time to practice. When trying to clear your schedule for practice time, it’s a good idea to log how you spend your time for a few days. You’ll be able to identify patterns and hopefully see slots in your routine that could be filled with practice. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

While this might seem like a straightforward question, we can gain tremendous knowledge if we venture to explore it in greater depth. In fact, this question can be rewarding not only in terms of the self-insight it can offer, but also by deepening our understanding of other people. In these blinks, you’ll discover that the way people respond to expectations, both their own and those posed by others, fits into Four Tendencies: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers and Rebels. You’ll learn what exactly it means to fit into each of these categories and how better understanding our own tendency can help us improve our productivity, and how we relate to others. These blinks aren’t about pigeonholing people into limiting categories, rather it’s about providing the insight that allows us to reach our full potential. You’ll also learn which tendency is most likely to be a snitch; why you shouldn’t let a Questioner choose your washing machine; and what can be the only way to make an Obliger exercise. One day, the author Gretchen Rubin was chatting with a friend over lunch and the conversation turned to exercise. Her friend was reflecting on the fact that when she was on the track and field team at school, she had no trouble finding the time to run, but now, forget about it! “Not having the time” is a common excuse for why we can’t get something done, but if you really want to get to the bottom of why some tasks are so hard to accomplish, you need to understand The Four Tendencies. The Four Tendencies are all about how we respond to the two kinds of expectations we face every day: the outer expectations that come from work and society, and the inner expectations we set for ourselves. The first of the Four Tendencies are Upholders. These are people who excel at meeting both inner and outer expectations. The second is Questioners, who are people who meet inner expectations but question and struggle with outer expectations. The third is Obligers, people who deal well with outside expectations but struggle with their own. And the fourth is the Rebels, who push against both inner and outer expectations. In the case of Rubin’s friend, who excelled at running when she had a coach and a team, but doesn’t find the time on her own, this is a typical scenario for an Obliger, someone who needs outside accountability. As we’ll see in the blinks ahead, none of these categories are inherently bad or meant to make you feel boxed in or doomed to lifelong problems. They’re meant as tools for gaining insight into your nature, and the nature of those you work and live with, so that you can be a more confident and productive individual. First of all, you should know that the author, Gretchen Rubin, slots right into the Upholder category, so she might be a little biased toward this one! At first glance, Upholders can appear to be an ideal category since they are generally very reliable and productive people. Since they respond well to both the expectations placed on them by other people and the expectations they place on themselves, they get their work done efficiently and make time for themselves. In other words, an Upholder is the kind of person who has no trouble getting to work on time and getting a full eight hours of sleep. To make sure they take care of the work given to them, as well as their personal tasks, Upholders are fond of schedules, to-do lists and having a clear understanding of what’s expected of them. Upholders find great satisfaction in meeting expectations and following rules, which means that these people are the kind that find it gratifying and liberating to have a disciplined life. In fact, a good motto for Upholders is “discipline brings freedom.” This Tendency doesn’t come without its challenges though, as anyone who’s lived with an Upholder will attest. They can, for example, be so ready to follow the rules that they neglect to ask questions and end up blindly adhering to rules and directions that are harmful or just plain wrong. These are also the kind of people who are most likely to be a snitch and the least likely to embrace change. Upholders can also experience what’s known as tightening, which is the opposite of how others experience a new habit. When you begin a new healthier diet, you might stick to it for a few days before it slowly falls by the wayside as you revert back to your usual comfort foods. An Upholder, however, can casually start a new habit, but over time it’ll tighten and become stronger and more controlling over their life. Upholders often have easy interactions with doctors and managers, since they’ll readily take orders and aim to please. If you’re trying to manage an Upholder, the best piece of advice is to make sure you give clear and precise instructions. Once they have a clear understanding of the priorities and what’s expected of them, Upholders can then be left to take care of business. They’re generally self-starters, so they don’t require a lot of micromanagement. However, they can have trouble delegating duties and adjusting to changes in routines. So if you see work piling up, or if there’s been an adjustment to procedures, you might want to check in to see if they need help. Upholders make great bosses and managers, but there are some things that can really get them frustrated. People in all of the Four Tendencies can have problems understanding why everyone else isn’t like them. So Upholders can get frustrated and impatient with people who fail to meet expectations – they don’t understand why some people can’t just put their mind to a task and get it done. This also means they can get upset and hostile when a mistake is made, which includes becoming defensive or beating themselves up for a mistake they make themselves. Making an error is such a potent fear that Upholders will avoid accepting a good opportunity, like a promotion, if they sense there’s a chance they might fail. For the spouse or partner of an Upholder, dealing with these characteristics is a matter of understanding and tolerance. Remember that all Upholders want to meet expectations, so you can help by, for example, avoiding making spontaneous changes or casually suggesting a plan that hasn’t been thought out. This is because Upholders are eager to please, so they might latch onto a bad idea and think they need to see it through to the bitter end. “I’m willing to help out, but you have to convince me why it’s worth my time.” Does this sound familiar? It’s a typical attitude of the second of the Four Tendencies, the Questioner. Questioners do a fine job of setting and meeting their own expectations, but they resist the expectations of others and feel a strong desire to question everything. The statement that best defines a Questioner is, “I do what makes sense, even if it means ignoring rules or other people’s expectations.” Unlike Upholders, a Questioner isn’t going to follow your instructions just because you’re the boss, or even if it’s a procedure people have been following for years. They want to know why you made this rule and whether or not it’s fair. As you can imagine, Questioners can be exhausting to deal with at times, but their nature can make them tremendously valuable. Since Questioners are skeptical of rules and procedures, they’re great at spotting the ways in which a procedure can be improved. Questioners are always thinking there’s a better way to do something, which makes them a perfect fit for an organization that wants to stay on the cutting edge. “Why are we using this software?” “What’s the benefit of this policy?” “Why do we need weekly meetings?” These are the kinds of challenging questions they ask, which can be of great benefit to any company – as long as the management is looking for novel ideas and doesn’t consider questions to be an act of insubordination. As such, some organizations may see a Questioner as not being a “team player.” Furthermore, the nature of a Questioner can be a hindrance when it results in analysis paralysis. The main reason for questions is to make sure the right decisions are being made, and even something as simple as buying a washing machine can result in days of research to identify the best machine. But sometimes this can result in the Questioner being overwhelmed and unable to make any decision at all – in other words, they will experience analysis paralysis. Have you ever been driven nuts by a kid who constantly follows up every answer with, “but why?” Then you already have some experience in dealing with a Questioner. The key to dealing with a Questioner is to be precise with your reasoning and justification when you want to give them a task. If you want your Questioner partner to buy bread on the way home, don’t just send a text that says, “Pls pick up bread, thx!” While it might take some extra effort on your part, you’ll be preventing a lot of hassle by being exact and asking him to pick up crusty sourdough bread because your mom is coming over tonight and it’s her favorite, and also because it will go perfectly with the soup you’re making. With this justification, you’ll be sure to avoid any follow-up questions. Another thing to keep in mind is that Questioners don’t like being questioned! If this sounds like a perfect irony, you’re right – but the fact remains that Questioners tend to feel insulted when someone questions their motives or reasoning. This is likely because they’re so thorough in their decision-making that they feel their choices should be seen as unquestionably logical. However, Questioners do like to share their knowledge, so you can avoid hurting their feelings by phrasing your question appropriately. So, instead of “Why are you doing that?” ask something like, “How did you come to this conclusion?” While Questioners can be great at any job, there are some scenarios they’d do best to avoid. Many Questioners find success in research-heavy roles and auditing jobs that suit their inquisitive nature and their knack for improving efficiency. But jobs that require a lot of decisions, like designing a home, are best left to people who don’t have a tendency to fall into analysis paralysis. These are jobs that are best left to people who excel at making quick decisions. Do you know someone who always puts others ahead of themselves? Someone who has no problem working overtime to help his boss but feels uncomfortable asking for any time off? These are the signs of an Obliger, a person who excels at meeting outside expectations but struggles with meeting inner expectations. Some of the everyday tasks an Obliger will have trouble with are exercising, taking an online course or doing much of anything that requires self-motivation. Conversely, they are quite effective at meeting the demands of others. In fact, since Obligers are the largest of the four groups, they are the dependable rocks of society. Even so, they struggle mightily to give themselves the same respect they give others. However, there is a reliable way to fix this unhealthy imbalance, namely by turning internal expectations into external ones. By doing this, Obligers can create the kind of outside accountability they need to take action. Let’s say you live alone and have trouble keeping the place clean unless you’re expecting company. For some people, all it takes is to imagine there are people on the way over and they can start cleaning; for others, they’ll invite people over for the very purpose of creating the accountability they need to spruce up the place. Another method is the threat of being charged a fee. Some Obligers find the motivation they need to exercise regularly because their gym will charge them if they don’t show up to their appointments. But money isn’t always enough; the necessary accountability is only achieved when there’s also the threat of letting a real person down. Obligers can get pretty creative in this regard, such as by exchanging their exercise gear with another person. This way, if you don’t show up with the gear, the other person won’t be able to exercise. This is exactly the kind of accountability many Obligers need to do something good for themselves. If the last blink sounded very familiar to you, you may also be familiar with people telling you that you simply need to be “more selfish.” You may also feel a sense of shame at needing to come up with these outside sources of accountability in order to take care of yourself. Indeed, the Obliger category may be the most difficult of the Four Tendencies. Over two-thirds of Obligers report feelings of frustration over their inability to devote any time to themselves. Feelings of low self-esteem are also common, which can be made worse by ignorant Upholders who call Obligers lazy for not exercising. This frustration can erupt into Obliger-rebellion, which is when an Obliger snaps after one too many times of being taken for granted, treated unfairly or shamed with accusations of being lazy or pathetic. In these moments, they might quit their job or break up with a partner. Other Obligers might get through their difficult times through small acts of defiance, like being deliberately late to work or refusing to prepare for a presentation. But these often only serve to self-sabotage the Obliger more than anything else, since they’re fireable offenses. Since they often have the most problems, it makes sense that knowing about the Four Tendencies might also benefit the Obligers the most. Many people benefit from simply discovering these categories and seeing how they all make sense. With this information, they now know that it’s part of human nature and not some personal defect. They can start setting up external accountability and begin making life better. Many Obligers have had to deal with bosses and therapists who don’t listen to their requests for accountability and tell them to “grow up and learn how to be accountable for yourself.” If only it were that easy! As more people who fall into different categories discover the Four Tendencies, they’ll also be able to make life easier for Obligers. They’ll see that they aren’t, in fact, lazy, and that they need a certain amount of oversight. Last but not least is the fourth tendency: the Rebel, whose motto could be “You can’t make me, and neither can I.” Because not only does the Rebel resist meeting outside expectations, they resist their own expectations as well. Rebels are all about individuality, and they want everything they do to be a reflection of their unique self. As such, anything that could be considered an expectation gets rejected. If this sounds rather extreme, keep in mind that Rebels are the smallest group of all four tendencies; it’s also true that this group loves to defy assumptions and prove people wrong. But even though Rebels hate being bossed around, they’re willing to work hard. It’s all a matter of framing things in a way that makes Rebels feel like they are the ones making the decision. If you’re the parent, teacher or boss of a Rebel, you know it can be a challenge dealing with their attitude. If you send an email to a Rebel with the title “Please read!” you shouldn’t be surprised if it’s immediately deleted. You don’t want to give a Rebel any sort of direct order, but if you give them the necessary information, explain the potential consequences and offer them the freedom to make their own choice, you stand a good chance of getting your desired outcome. So, provide them with the details of the current situation, the consequences of the different choices available and then walk away; this will give them the space to make their own decision. If the Rebel has an audience staring at them and waiting for the decision, this will still feel like they’re being bossed around. Instead of “Let’s meet up next week,” try something like, “Let’s meet up when you feel like it. I have next week off so that works for me.” Just like Obligers, Rebels can have trouble taking care of themselves and meeting their inner expectations. While it might be for different reasons, such as not wanting to be a conformist, the result can be the same. Even if a Rebel wants to exercise and eat a healthy diet, they can be frustrated with their inability to stick to routines and do what’s good for them. Being an authentic individual is at the top of a Rebel’s priorities, so the secret to meeting expectations is for them to align their identity with their goals. For example, if you’re a Rebel who has trouble staying in shape and eating healthily, make being a great chef and fitness geek a central part of your identity. Once this takes hold, a well-made meal and yoga will become part of who you are. Other Rebels have used play-acting to get around these Rebel barriers. So, if you need to pay the bills, even though every fiber of your being says that doing so is the worst kind of conformist nonsense, just put on the accountant hat and pretend you’re someone else for the time it takes to get it over with. Another way to get in the healthy frame of mind is to get your Rebel mind going against the corporations that want you to eat junk food, smoke cigarettes and drink booze. So, if you’re trying to set inner expectations related to quitting these vices, you can always use the anti-corporation angle. One method that has proven quite reliable to setting inner expectations in a Rebel is the bet. This has worked well for the loved ones of Rebels, and all it takes is saying something like, “I bet there’s no way you can quit smoking.” Rebels love a challenge and they love to prove someone else wrong, so this bit of reverse psychology is surprisingly reliable. You may think that the only job for an Upholder would be one that enforces rules, since they’re so eager to meet expectations, but this is a shortsighted look at what the tendencies tell us. It’s true that our tendency can help us better understand our strengths and weaknesses, but you shouldn’t see these categories as limiting anyone to certain roles. The author was at a dinner with a few Upholders who all agreed that their type were the ones who would make the best business leaders, since they would put the interests of the company ahead of their own. But if it were a group of Questioners, they’d probably agree that their group makes the best CEOs. The truth is, any type can produce a great leader, and if you want to be successful, it only helps to know more about yourself, including your strengths and weaknesses. And this is precisely how the Four Tendencies can be useful to each and every one of us. No one type is better than any other, since they all have strengths and weaknesses, and being familiar with these will allow you to understand yourself, your partner, coworkers, boss and family members. If you’re an Upholder who’s dating a Questioner, the Four Tendencies can help you understand your attraction. There’s a good chance you like that they ask the questions you don’t feel comfortable asking yourself. In work and in life, knowing the characteristics of the Four Tendencies can be extremely helpful. Here’s a little cheat-sheet to keep in mind: Upholders want you to tell them what needs to be done; they value self-reliance and performance. Questioners want you to justify what needs to be done; they value justification and purpose. Obligers want you to hold them accountable for what needs to be done; they value teamwork and duty. Rebels want you to let them decide what needs to be done; they value freedom and individuality. Just as no one type is more successful, no one type is happier than another, either. What does bring more happiness is understanding ourselves better. The key message in this book: The key to happiness is to understand your own strengths and weaknesses, collectively known as your Tendency. Once you can recognize these aspects of yourself, you can start to adjust to and compensate for them. No one is perfect, and we can make life much easier on ourselves by avoiding pitfalls and playing to our strengths.  Actionable advice: Make your signage work for all four types. Is the kitchen or bathroom at your workplace a mess? Don’t make a sign that bosses people around, since it’s going to make the Rebels in your office want to be deliberately messy. Instead, make a sign that gives them information, consequences and choices. It could read:  “A messy workplace is a sign of disrespect and can negatively affect morale. Please be professional and help us keep the area clean.” This allows a Rebel to make their own choice. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But there’s another important reason for keeping your home clear of clutter – you ensure that someone else doesn’t have to do the job later on. You might think of cleaning up or reorganizing your life as a hassle best avoided or otherwise put off to a much later date. Generally speaking, we put stuff in our basement, attic or storage space, so we don’t have to think about it. But here’s the thing: if you don’t want to go through your boxes and figure out what’s worthwhile and what isn’t, why would you want to make your loved ones do it after you’re gone? While you may not like tidying up, these blinks will show you that it doesn’t have to be a big painful ordeal. Regularly taking stock of your belongings and keeping your house in order can be peaceful and reassuring. In these blinks, you’ll learn why selling an heirloom may be better than holding onto it; how death cleaning can be an opportunity for family bonding; and how a “throw-away box” can save your family from embarrassment. Have you ever stopped to consider what’s going to happen to all of your stuff when you die? Whatever you leave behind will inevitably end up being the responsibility of your loved ones. And having to go through all your belongings isn’t just a tall order in terms of time and effort; it’s also sure to take quite a psychological toll. Of course, acknowledging your own mortality can be uncomfortable, but when you think about it, the considerate thing to do would be to take care of your belongings ahead of time. The Swedish have a name for this – döstädning, or “death cleaning.” There are a number of reasons you might find yourself cleaning house and reducing your amount of belongings. You may have lost a loved one, found yourself facing a break-up or divorce, downsizing to a smaller home or making the transition to a nursing home. Having lived a long life, moving 17 times, the author knows a thing or two about the art of death cleaning. With each move, she’s gained more insight into what deserves to be carried around. Now, you don’t need to be sick or even elderly to take steps to make things easier for your loved ones. In fact, the smart thing to do is start cleaning up now rather than later. The art of döstädning is more than just dusting and tidying up; it’s essentially taking a fine-toothed comb to all of your belongings to chuck away any unnecessary things. What’s more, it’s a permanent state of living your life in such an organized way that things constantly run smoothly. You might find the process difficult, but there are ways to emotionally prepare yourself and make it as quick and painless as possible. For example, when the author’s parents passed away, she inherited a lovely bracelet from her mom. Now, if she were to keep this item in her possession, it would create the possibility of conflict between her five children as to who would inherit the bracelet. When she practiced death cleaning, she avoided this problem altogether by selling the bracelet. After all, each of her kids had already inherited something from their grandparents, so why complicate things with jealousy and hard feelings? If you know that going through all of your stuff would be a heavy and painful burden for your loved ones, figuring out how to downsize could very well take you a lot of time. Nevertheless, it’ll only get worse the longer you wait. So let’s get started and learn some practices and preparation that can make the process easier. The best place to begin your döstädning is at the top or the bottom, depending on whether you have a basement, attic or both since this is where needless clutter tends to pile up. You may also find junk you forgot you had piling up in cupboards by your front door. Whether it’s sports equipment you haven’t used in ages or an old dollhouse gathering dust, consider who in your life would use and enjoy these things now. If you’re not sure, you can invite people over to have a look at all the books, toys or tools for which you have no use. This can be a good opportunity to bond with your family as well, especially grandchildren who may not be so familiar with your younger days. As you go through your things, you can bring up the stories and old memories associated with these belongings. This is a perfect win-win situation; you’ll get closer to your loved ones, and they might get some great things they’ll cherish! The more time you spend going through your belongings, the easier it will become to know what to keep and what to get rid of. You may also find yourself knowing just who to give items to. The author’s mother-in-law, for instance, owned a store filled with imported goods, including items from Japan, hand-made baskets, precious china and printed tablecloths. As she got on in years, she began to give away an item from her inventory to each family member that visited, generously adding beautiful things to her family’s homes. Now, while attics and basements make for a good place to start, you don’t want to begin with stacks of personal letters, papers or photographs. These are bound to be the most sentimental, humorous, poignant and potentially sad items among your belongings. They can easily get you pausing to read each page, bog you down in memory lane and keep you from making any progress with all your other stuff. So leave these items until you’ve made significant progress on figuring out the destiny of your big pieces of clutter, like furniture, books and other belongings that take up the most space. When it comes to death cleaning, size really does matter! Back when the author was growing up, it was thought of as impolite for a child to ask an adult questions about death. As a result, young people generally had no idea what adults thought about death or how they prepared for it. Fortunately, honesty is more valued than politeness these days, so it’s more acceptable to ask a loved one something like, “What do you plan on doing with all of your things when you’re no longer able to look after yourself?” So now’s the time to ask your relative the difficult question if you are worried about having to take care of their things when they’re gone. This is a common worry for those of us with elderly parents; few people look forward to putting things on hold so they can sort through the belongings of a deceased parent. If this is something you’re concerned about, but want to be more gentle in your approach, you might try a question like, “Wouldn’t it be easier to clean and manage your home if we gave away some of these things?” Or maybe, “Can I help you sort through some of your things now, so we don’t have to do it all at once later on?” If your parents don’t pick up the hints the first time around, just give it some time and try rephrasing the subject. Certainly, it can be challenging to find both the honesty and tact to bring up death cleaning. So, if all else fails, you might find success by bringing up the traditions of the Vikings! During the age of the Vikings, a loved one would be buried with their belongings so that they wouldn’t miss them in the afterlife. But this practice had the additional benefit of helping the surviving loved ones move on since they weren’t surrounded by the old belongings and spirits of the dead. Of course, this isn’t so practical today. Given all the junk we accumulate, we’d have to be buried in graves the size of a giant swimming pool for everything to fit! If you have a secret vice that you don’t discuss with anyone, think about how awkward this might be if a loved one stumbled upon it after you’re gone. Or, think about how you’d rather not come upon some secret that changes your understanding of someone close to you. So you’d be doing others a big favor by getting rid of any embarrassing private letters, diaries or anything else that has the potential to hurt your loved ones. And don't just put the incriminating documents somewhere they'll never find them – burn them or feed them to a shredder. When the author was death cleaning her parents’ home after they had passed away, she found a few surprising things, including secret cartons of cigarettes her mom had hidden in the linen closet. But perhaps more mysterious was the large piece of arsenic she found in her father’s desk. It must have been there for 30 years, likely dating back to the time when they feared the Germans would invade Sweden. But the question remained, why would he hold on to it for so long? Did he think the poison would still come in handy someday? The more considerate act would be to avoid having loved ones consider such troubling questions and dispose of items like these yourself. If you can’t bear to get rid of sentimental yet potentially troubling items, consider putting them in an easily disposable “throw-away box.” This way, you don’t have to burn cherished items, and your loved ones don’t have to sort through them; they can simply dispose of the box. Just keep it small and shoebox-sized, and label it with “please throw away” instructions so that it’s easy for others to handle. The author has found that one of the most important life lessons she’s learned is knowing when to let go of things, be they belongings, pets or people. Once you’ve taken care of the larger things and thrown away your personal and potentially troubling items, it’s time to deal with the smaller objects that can still pack a heavy emotional punch: the photographs. Your collection of personal snapshots may continue to hold a great deal of meaning for your family after you’re gone. However, since everyone’s memories are different, a photograph you cherish might not have the same meaning for your child. You may find it helpful to follow the author’s lead and give each of your kids their own personal photo album. This way, you can send them a stack of new photos from time to time and let them decide which photos they want to keep in their album. This worked out well for the author as her children looked forward to getting photos in their mailbox, and she didn’t have to worry about dividing them up. When going through your own photographs, there are some simple tips to help make it a little less painful. First of all, discard superfluous copies and chuck any photos full of people you can't name. If loved ones want multiple copies, let them deal with it on their own. And if you can't name all the people in the photo, chances are no one else can either. Digitizing your photos and putting them all on a USB memory stick is another helpful way to declutter a closet worth of photos onto a small, convenient device. The author recommends that you start the death cleaning process no later than the age of 65. This is a time when you’re likely to start coming to terms with your mortality but are still young enough to have plenty of time to sort out all your belongings at a leisurely pace. Remember, the gentle art of döstädning is as much about letting you peacefully recall a lifetime’s worth of fond memories as it is about being considerate to those you leave behind. The key message in these blinks: By going through your belongings in preparation for death and considering what you leave behind for others to deal with, you’ll be saving your loved ones time and heartache. But the experience can also be an enjoyable one for you. Start the process early and give yourself, and your family, plenty of time to take pleasure from your belongings and their histories.  Actionable advice: Ask yourself some important questions before adopting a pet. If you’re approaching old age and would like a new pet, consider adopting an older one that has a similar energy level to you from a shelter. And make sure you have someone who is willing to care for the animal when you pass on. If you can’t find anyone, think twice before adopting. Got feedback?

We’re churning out more stuff than we need, and our rubbish dumps are piling up at an alarming rate. To curb materialism, we have to ask ourselves: Do we have too much stuff? Probably. Most likely, you’ll realize you own many things that you don’t actually need. These blinks will show you how to determine what should be kept and what shouldn’t. You’ll learn how to develop a minimalist mind-set, which will not only help combat your stress but also ease the strain on your wallet. But most importantly, by looking more closely at your possessions, you’ll realize that the valuable things in life aren’t necessarily items that you own. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to develop a sense of detachment from your belongings; what STREAMLINE stands for; and about the usefulness of baking powder. Take a look around your house. Do you feel overwhelmed by all the things you’ve collected over the years? Is your credit-card debt rising and rising? If so, it’s time to start developing a minimalist mind-set so you can gain control of all your belongings. To develop a minimalist mind-set, you need to first divide your stuff into three categories: useful, beautiful and sentimental. The useful category contains all the things that are functional and practical. Obviously, this includes items that are necessary for our survival, such as clothing, water, shelter and food. But it also includes Items that make our lives easier, like beds, pens, laptops, plates, and so on. Beautiful possessions are those that give us a deeply satisfying feeling, and they deserve to be part of our lives. Sentimental items are reminders of people, places and events that are important to us. Before you can become a minimalist and start decluttering, you need to form a sense of non-attachment to your possessions. The usefulness of a minimalist life can be observed in this example: It’s the middle of the night and you’re fast asleep, when suddenly a fire alarm goes off. Is your first instinct to gather your laptop, important files and photographs? Of course not, the most important thing would be to get you and the other people you’re living with out of the house.  In other words, when it comes to your health and happiness, the most important things aren’t material items. And while we all get attached to beautiful and sentimental items, it’s important to develop an unattached, minimalist mind-set to keep things in perspective. These beautiful and sentimental items aren’t the most important things. Understanding that is the first step to successfully decluttering our homes and truly valuing the things that are worth it. Now that we’ve developed our minimalist framework, we can start putting it into practice. The next step to decluttering your home is to follow the STREAMLINE technique. The first half of STREAMLINE involves: Start Over; Trash, Treasure or Transfer; Reason For Each Item; Everything in its Place; and All Surfaces Clear. Start Over means what it says, that is, getting a fresh start. Approach the room, or refrigerator, or whatever you’re working on, as if it’s brand new.  Trash, Treasure or Transfer is next, where you sort through the sections – e.g. a drawer, or any storage container – and place each item in one of three piles. Things like stained clothes, expired cosmetic products and junk mail goes into the Trash pile. Useful, beautiful and sentimental things go into the Treasure pile, keeping in mind that you should only keep beautiful and sentimental items that can be displayed. The Transfer pile contains all the things that are no longer useful to you. Try to resist the urge to hang onto these things because you think you might need them one day. Reason For Each Item involves the question: Does the item have a good reason for being kept in the Treasure pile? Everything in its Place requires you to ask: Do you use the item daily, weekly, monthly, once a year or less? The answer will help you determine where the item should be placed. Repeatedly used things, such as your laptop and toothbrush, should be placed in the Inner Circle, or somewhere that is easily accessible without you having to bend or stretch. The Outer Circle holds your less frequently used things, such as specialty cooking tools and cleaning supplies. These things can be stored in places that are out of the way, like under the bed or in the upper cabinets. Deep Storage refers to spaces such as the basement or garage, where spare parts, Christmas decorations and old documents are kept. All Surfaces Clear refers to keeping work desks, kitchen counters and coffee tables free of clutter. An uncleared surface is full of distractions, making it difficult to work efficiently at home or prepare a meal. So that was the first half of the STREAMLINE technique. Let’s continue and find out what the remaining steps are. The remaining half of the STREAMLINE technique is: Modules; Limits; If One Comes In, One Goes Out; Narrow Down and Everyday Maintenance. Modules are groups of items with a similar function, like a first aid kit. So when you’re in need of a band-aid, you know to look in your first aid kit in the bathroom cabinet. After consolidating all your belongings, you’ll need to remove any excess supplies. Ask yourself if you really need all 63 pens, if realistically you only use five of them. It’s important to consolidate and cut so that excess supplies don’t end up spreading throughout the house. Color-coded and labeled drawers, shelves, boxes and plastic containers are excellent ways to store your sorted items. Limits need to be established to ensure that your collections don’t get out of hand. For example, limit your book collection so that you keep only your favorites and place the rest in your Transfer pile, where they could get given to friends, family or charity. Or instead of buying a bunch of books, you could borrow from the library or buy an e-book reader. If One Comes In, One Goes Out begs the question: Have you bought a new version of something to replace your outdated one, only to never throw away the old one? Whenever you acquire a new item, you need to dispose of the similar one. Narrow Down requires you to tackle as many tasks as you can with the least amount of products. This is where an all-purpose cleaner will come in handy, diminishing the need for multiple sprays. Everyday Maintenance is needed to maintain a minimalist household. Commit to throwing away one item per day and you’ll never accumulate clutter again. Now that we’ve learned what STREAMLINE stands for, it’s time to put it into action! We’ll start with the home, tackling one room at a time. First, the bedroom. Turn your bedroom into an area of peace and relaxation by getting rid of clutter. Following the STREAMLINE method, you’ll need to make Trash, Treasure and Transfer piles. Things that fall into the Trash pile include anything that has no visual or functional purpose in your bedroom, like an unused exercise machine. Since the primary purpose of your bedroom is to serve as a space where you sleep and store clothes, items that fall into the Treasure pile include the book you’re currently reading and your alarm clock. Transfer items are things like toys, craft materials and magazines that should be moved to another room or donated. Then you should Narrow Down the stuff in your bedroom until it’s at a functional minimum. The author and her husband keep only a futon mattress on the floor. They’ve eliminated the desire to keep a vanity table since they’ve transferred all grooming duties to the bathroom. In addition to your bedroom, you could also STREAMLINE your wardrobe to save on money, time and stress. Start Over by taking everything out of your wardrobe. Keep going until all your drawers, hangers and shelves are cleared. Next, form Trash, Treasure and Transfer piles to help you decide what you should do with each article of clothing. If you need to, try on your clothes to help your decision-making. Anything irreparable – such as a shirt with a large hole – goes into the Trash pile. Clothes that showcase your personal style and flatter your appearance belong in the Treasure pile. Make a list of the different activities you need certain clothes for, like work, exercise and social occasions, and then make a value judgment. Keep in mind that fashion trends change quickly, and your wardrobe may fill up with outdated clothes. If you want to follow current trends, it’s imperative that you apply the One In, One Out rule of the STREAMLINE method. When you splurge on that fancy new business suit, remember to throw away an old, unused one. Scan your living room. What state is it in? Are there magazines and toys littered across the floor and table? The living room is where our family and friends spend a lot of time, so it’s important to free up space for entertainment. The first question you should ask when it comes to optimizing living-room space is: What’s the Reason For Each Item to be here? When the author and her husband lived overseas, they had no use for a couch or television. They didn’t receive many visitors, and most evenings and weekends were spent out of town. For their situation, a coffee table and two lounge chairs were enough. The next step is to create Modules for different activities, instead of lumping everything together in a mess. Label plastic containers with an activity – painting, knitting, and so on – and load in all the related equipment. Not only will Modules make it more efficient to gather the things needed to engage in the activity, but they will also make cleaning much easier. Try and keep All Surfaces Clear so that you have a safe and stress-free area for you and your children. Kids need a lot of room to move and explore, which can be dangerous with books and toys scattered over the floor. Now it’s time to declutter your home office to boost productivity. First, Narrow Down paperwork by digitizing all documents, including letters, greeting cards and bills. Investing in a scanner will help reduce the amount of paper, and you can opt to switch to online bank statements and digital newspaper subscriptions. Follow the Everyday Maintenance rule and keep your work-desk tidy and your paperwork at a minimum. A stack of paperwork can build up quickly, so it’s crucial that you sort through and scan everything on a regular basis, remembering to throw away anything that isn’t relevant anymore. Ever flicked through a kitchen catalog or walked through a showroom wishing that your kitchen was as clutter-free and functional? Well, if you follow the minimalist mind-set, that dream kitchen can be yours. Once again, we need to get rid of excess items to improve the functionality of your kitchen. Create Trash, Treasure and Transfer piles to determine what is and isn’t necessary. When did you last check the expiry date of all the items in your pantry and fridge? Expired items will need to go into the Trash pile. If it’s something as useful and efficient as a rice cooker or kettle, however, then it belongs on the Treasure pile. Duplicates of kitchenware, or simply stuff you won’t ever use, can go into the Transfer pile – even the pasta machine you got six Christmases ago. Why not give it to someone who would be able to put it to good use? Likewise, you can donate excess packaged or canned foods to a charity or soup kitchen. A minimalist mind-set can also create a relaxing atmosphere in your bathroom. First, run through your daily routine to Narrow Down your belongings. A toothbrush, toothpaste and towel are all necessary and belong in your Treasure pile. To help you further cut down on excess, consider multi-purpose products. For instance, mixed with some water baking soda can be good for exfoliation, removing makeup and conditioning your hair! Limited space can also be solved by moving your items to either your Inner Circle, Outer Circle or Deep Storage. Things in your Treasure pile should be easily accessible and in the Inner Circle. Items that are used less frequently, such as nail clippers and a first-aid kit, belong in the Outer Circle. Deep Storage is reserved for bulk-buy items, like toilet paper. At this stage, you’ve cultivated a minimalist mind-set, put the STREAMLINE method to use, and your home is now clutter-free. All that’s left to do is get your family to join in. Maintaining a minimalist home requires the participation of the whole family. Set an example and show your kids that life doesn’t revolve around material items. It’s no surprise that children learn from watching their parents. Make sure they learn the right behaviors and abstain from the negative ones, such as spending entire weekends shopping or obsessing about material items. Additionally, don’t keep too many things in your wardrobe and drawers. Leading by example can be extremely rewarding for a parent. The author’s proudest moment, for example, was when her three-year-old child said she didn’t need many toys, the sun is enough! Another way to get your family involved is inviting them to join your decluttering projects. Having everyone clear out the basement or garage together is not only more efficient, but you’ll each feel a sense of achievement and strengthen your family bond as you rummage through memories. You can also assign each member of your family an area for their stuff, which will make them feel responsible for their personal items. To eradicate any of their initial fears about decluttering, it’s important to reassure them that not everything needs to go. The designated space for the rest of their things could be somewhere in the garage or the child’s bedroom. Finally, so that it becomes a habit for your family, make it a daily ritual to get rid of something. Choose a time between dinner and bed for everyone to pick up their belongings and return them to their assigned space. If you do this every day, the collective activity should move like clockwork and not take longer than ten minutes. Clutter doesn’t form overnight, so neither will it disappear so quickly. With a minimalist mind-set, however, together with the STREAMLINE method, you will be able to experience a new and wonderful way of living. The key message in these blinks: The first step to living a minimalist life is to develop a sense of non-attachment to your possessions by dividing them into the useful, beautiful or sentimental categories. Then you can put your mind-set into practice with the STREAMLINE method. Following that and staying vigilant will free up your space and your mind to focus on what really matters. Actionable advice: Act as though you’re permanently moving abroad. Would you take along your banged-up guitar or moldy teddy bear? Use this framework to examine and determine which items to keep and which to throw away. By setting restrictions, you’ll be forced to consider the properties of each belonging, questioning its usefulness, durability and personal significance. Got feedback?

Well, the key to this is to better understand the influences involved and our underlying motivations. These blinks aim to highlight the aspects of human nature that go overlooked or are under-discussed and make sure that we understand just how influential they can be. For the most part, we don’t like to admit that we’re envious, self-centered and prone to group mentality. However, we all have these tendencies. Once we acknowledge these aspects of human nature, we can begin to make the best of it by curbing these impulses or even using them to our advantage. We are all complex individuals, but there are parts of the human experience that touch us all. With a better understanding of human nature, you can start to live a better life with more control over your impulses. In the following blinks, you’ll find why it’s better to have a farsighted perspective; why you should always maintain a “reality group;” and why it’s beneficial to keep death in mind. We like to think that modern human beings are a clever and highly rational bunch. But the truth is we tend to make a lot of our decisions based on the emotions we feel at any given moment, which means we’re often pretty irrational. This struggle between our emotional and rational sides has gone on for ages. One of the early champions of rational behavior was Pericles, a well-respected statesman in Athens around the fifth century BC. When Athens was under threat of attack by the Spartans, Pericles was able to convince leaders to show restraint and not engage in all-out war. Unfortunately, his wisdom didn’t prevail when Athens was struck by the plague and Pericles died. Instead, emotions took over and resulted in a costly and drawn-out war that brought Athens to its knees. The secret to Pericles’s wisdom was patience, and this is what we still need to rely on to curb our irrational decisions. If there was a problem or important decision to be made, Pericles would withdraw to his home and calmly think it over, consider all the potential consequences and make the decision that’s in everyone’s best interest, not just the leaders or wealthiest people. So, whenever possible, increase your reaction time so that you’re not making decisions in the heat of an emotional moment. And meanwhile, try to consider all the possible biases influencing the decision. There are a number of these, including confirmation bias, where we tend to seek out information that supports our prejudices, and conviction bias, that leads us to believe that the stronger our emotions are, the more something must be true. Other biases include the appearance bias, which leads us to believe that someone who looks appealing, whether it’s attractive or rich, must somehow be of good character. Then there’s the group bias, which leads us to believe whatever the group we belong to suggests. For example, if you’re a member of a right or left-leaning political party, you might agree with every one of the party standpoints without considering alternate views. Our biases can easily lead to bad decisions, so it’s always good to be skeptical, analytical and curious about differing viewpoints. Plus, it’s wise to balance thinking with your emotions. You don’t have to be an emotionless robot when making a decision, but you’re bound to make better decisions when you’re feeling calm. Along with our tendencies to be irrational, human nature also carries with it the need for a certain amount of attention and self-absorption. In fact, by our very nature, we’re all narcissistic to some extent. This means each of us exists on a spectrum, ranging from healthy levels of narcissism to deep narcissism. Deep narcissists are usually people with a faulty sense of self, where they see other people as an extension of themselves. This can be traced back to childhood and the years between two and five years old, the age when a person stops seeing themselves as an extension of their mother and develops a sense of individual personhood. At this point, deep narcissism can develop for two reasons: either the parent was too involved, preventing the establishment of an individual identity, or the parent didn’t give the child any attention, creating a sense of abandonment. This results in low self-esteem and feelings of insecurity. As a result, deep narcissists try to cope with their broken sense of self through behavior patterns that include jealousy, attention-seeking, over-controlling, taking everything personally and being unable to handle criticism. Ironically, narcissism is often associated with “self-love.” This is actually what many deep narcissists lack, a proper sense of self to love. Indeed, one of the best ways to gain a healthier level of narcissism is to create a sense of self that you can love, which will reduce insecurity and raise self-esteem. Empathy is another thing that deep narcissists lack, and this is one of the best tools you can have in life. Empathy is the ability to sense what others are going through, thereby connecting us to the people in our lives. It’s also great for recognizing people’s true character and having the insight to turn yourself into a person of superior character. When it comes to being a judge of character, it’s important to understand that we all wear masks in our day-to-day life. We’re always trying to win people over by presenting ourselves in what we think is the best light and saying things we think people want to hear. As Shakespeare famously wrote, “All the world’s a stage.” So we shouldn’t accept what we see and hear as a reflection of a person’s true character. A person’s true character often reveals itself in how they face adversity, work with other people and whether or not they learn and adapt. Each and every one of us has a character that is a mix of strong and weak qualities. Some of these qualities we gain genetically, others are from our upbringing. Then there are the ones we pick up later in life. For example, researchers have found evidence that some newborns are more hostile than others, suggesting that our aggression levels are genetic. But our innate traits aren’t a prison. We can control them, and even weak ones can be used to our advantage. No matter the cards we’ve been dealt in life, we can strive to be of superior character. The first step is to be honest and admit that our characteristics are part of human nature and are nothing to be ashamed of. We can start by taking an honest look at ourselves, our past mistakes and our weaknesses and strengths. For example, a hyperperfectionist, who feels the need to control everything and can’t delegate tasks, shouldn’t deny it and put herself into situations in which she’ll be smothering people or fighting for the spotlight. Instead, she should find work that allows her to be in charge of a workload that doesn’t require delegation. Another aspect of human nature that people don’t like to admit to is envy. Yet, it’s a simple fact that we all tend to covet what we don’t have. As the sayings goes, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and there’s always a better place just over the horizon. There are some biological reasons for our envious nature. For starters, we’re not wired to be complacent. Instead, we’re competitive by nature and feel the same strong desire for things whether we encounter them in the real world or in our imagination. One of the reasons we tend to deny our feelings of jealousy is because admitting we feel covetous is also admitting that we feel inferior to someone else. Still, it doesn’t do any good to ignore or deny our jealousy, and once we admit to the fact that everyone has these feelings, we can start putting it to work for us. Knowing that we covet what’s elusive, we can start to make ourselves more appealing to others by employing the traits of elusiveness. In other words, we can be a bit mysterious and hard to pin down. The more we make people use their imagination, the more fascinated they’ll be. You might wonder why so much money and attention goes toward fighting terrorism while global warming, which affects all living things on the planet, is trivialized. The reason is very much tied to human nature. You’re far more likely to react to something that’s right in front of you here and now. This short-sightedness goes back a long way, to when survival was based on immediate concerns, such as finding food and water and avoiding violent predators like the saber-toothed tiger. To perform at your best, you need to recognize the tendency to neglect the big picture in favor of immediate concerns. However, it’s far better to adopt a farsighted perspective. First, remember to take a step back when making decisions and calmly consider the problem at hand, what your options are and what the consequences are likely to be. When you also recognize that today’s problems are likely the consequence of actions taken in the past, you’ll be better able to assess them. You should also know that sometimes doing nothing is the best thing to do! Western culture often considers doing nothing a sign of weakness, but Japanese and Chinese cultures both recognize the strategic wisdom in waiting to see what happens and letting the enemy wear himself out. Another strategy is to know how to deal with people’s natural defensiveness. Everyone is defensive to some degree, because everyone privileges autonomy and free will. That’s why one of the best techniques for managing human nature is to make someone agree with our plan as though it was their idea. This is done by showing our appreciation of the other person, validating their individuality and intelligence and playing to their natural stubbornness. Take the early career trajectory of the US politician and eventual president, Lyndon B. Johnson. When he first became a senator, he already had a reputation of being a hotheaded Texan, but Johnson knew he wasn’t going to get far using the same rabble-rousing tactics he employed as a congressman. Instead, he became fast friends with veteran democrat Georgian senator Richard Russell, outwardly admiring his experience and expertise. Russel, in turn, was impressed with Johnson’s organizational skills and helped Johnson get a seat on the Armed Services Committee after just a year and a half in the Senate, which is practically unheard of for such a prestigious committee. Johnson’s shrewd but friendly tactics led him to become the youngest ever senate leader of the Democratic Party at the age of 44. Do you ever feel like you’re cursed, or perhaps doomed to failure? If so, it’s likely due to certain unhelpful traits that you need to recognize and get under control. When you look within and see what’s repeatedly causing the same negative outcomes, then you can turn things around and avoid future calamities. Believe it or not, one of the main contributors to self-sabotage is a negative attitude. Fortunately, that’s something you can change. If you think your bad attitude is justified, just look at the life of legendary playwright Anton Chekhov. When he was a young boy, Chekhov lived with a father who regularly beat him and forced him to work at his shop rather than do his school work. What’s more, due to his father’s bad business sense, his family had to flee to Moscow. In doing so they literally abandoned Chekhov when he was around sixteen years old, leaving him behind to fend for himself while he finished school. The only reason he survived was because he was able to find the odd job as a tutor. It would have been understandable if Chekhov had developed a pessimistic attitude. Yet what Chekhov had was a remarkable sense of empathy that enabled him to pity his father, rather than be angry with him. When his family left, it gave him the opportunity to see them in a new perspective, and he recognized that his father had to cope with his own terrible upbringing and that he was really a lost, helpless old man. When Chekhov felt forgiveness for his father, he felt as though his mind was finally free. He felt liberated from anger. Negative emotions must be let go. If you hold on to or repress feelings of anger or worthlessness, they’re likely to lead to a prison of your own making, where things like drugs and alcohol become ways to numb the pain and repress your true feelings. If you have a dark side to your personality, whether it’s negative feelings or just selfish impulses, the first step is to acknowledge it. Then you can begin to use it in positive ways. The author refers to the dark feelings one represses as a “shadow self,” and the more these feelings are repressed, the more destructive they can be when they come to the surface. Look at former US president Richard Nixon, who bottled up his feelings of resentment and abandonment until they led to destructive behavior that destroyed his presidency. If you know someone who’s experienced even a little success, you may have looked on in wonder as that success went to their head and they proceeded to lose touch with reality. This is known as the Law of Grandiosity. Take the career of Michael Eisner: In 1976, Eisner made the leap from successful TV executive to head of the Paramount film studio. During his tenure, Paramount had a string of hits, even becoming the leading studio in Hollywood for a period. In 1984, Eisner then became the new CEO of Disney and proceeded to oversee the release of fifteen hit movies that revitalized the struggling brand. Eisner also came up with the idea of strategically using the company’s back catalog in the burgeoning home video market. In Eisner’s eyes, everything he touched turned to gold. But then he focused his attention on theme parks and building Euro Disney in France. It was far from a success, with attendances around half of what they’d hoped for. But Eisner was quick to cast blame elsewhere. In 1994 he shocked the industry by firing his underling Jeffrey Katzenberg, who’d been largely responsible for many recent hits, including The Lion King. Eisner also declined to purchase Yahoo! and instead orchestrated Disney’s own internet portal called Go. It was another calamity that leaked vast amounts of money. Meanwhile, Katzenberg successfully sued Disney for $280 million in unpaid bonuses while Pixar CEO Steve Jobs said he would refuse to work with Disney ever again due to Eisner’s meddling. Finally, with Disney’s stock prices dwindling, Eisner was voted out by board members in September of 2005. As a TV and film executive, Eisner showed he had a keen grasp on the tastes of US audiences, but afterward, with Euro Disney and Go, he showed little understanding for the tastes of Europeans or what people want in an internet service. But Eisner had lost his sense of reality. In not accepting the limits of his expertise and instead feeling insecure and threatened by underlings like Katzenberg, he helped precipitate his own downfall. Surely, a person with a grip on reality would have known that someone with Katzenberg’s talents would become a competitor once fired from Disney, which is exactly what happened when Katzenberg helped found Dreamworks. When you experience success, it’s easy to forget that mentors and teammates, as well as timing and luck, likely helped you get there. So it’s important at the best of times to be aware of contributing factors and your own strengths, limits and weaknesses. Remember: be realistic. In 1463, Caterina Sforza was born into a powerful dynasty in Milan, Italy, giving her the chance to pursue whatever interests she had. From a young age, Caterina had been drawn to physical combat training as well as fashion and the arts, so she became a student of both. In other words, Caterina was free to indulge both her feminine and masculine sides, becoming a strong figure who fascinated both the men and women of Milan. This universal fascination is something that artists like David Bowie achieve as well, when they explore both the masculine and feminine parts of their personality. We attain masculinity and femininity both from our genes and our upbringing. Due to society’s influence, men generally repress their feminine side and women their masculine side, but we’re better off embracing this duality within us. For starters, it would improve our relationships, making us more empathetic to those of the opposite sex. It can also improve problem solving, creativity and confidence. Men and women tend to think of the world in different ways, with men looking closely to separate and categorize things and women stepping back to see patterns and connections. The best minds will have ready access to both ways of thinking. Another way to experience a big boost in life is to get closer to a sense of higher purpose. Since we’re all complex people, we can easily slip into a sense of aimlessness and feel a general lack of cohesion. But if we take a calm look within, we can find what it is that really excites us. Often, we can trace back our higher purpose to a moment in childhood. For Steve Jobs, it was seeing his first electronics store as a young boy. For Marie Curie, it was being immediately fascinated when seeing chemistry tools for the first time. For legendary film director Akira Kurosawa, it happened later in life when he worked as an assistant for another director, Kajiro Yamamoto. Until then, he hadn’t recognized the full potential of film. But standing behind Yamamoto, he experienced a transcendent moment where everything suddenly became clear and made sense. It’s these moments we should be searching for, as they’re the ones that point to a higher purpose in life. We like to think of ourselves as unique, civilized and sophisticated individuals with independent minds. But if we pay close attention to human nature, we see that we also spend a lot of time worrying about what others think and how well we fit into certain groups. While it’s true that we’ve come a long way from our tribal roots, we still tend to devolve into primitive, reactionary thinking when we’re part of a group. It’s not a pleasant thing to consider, but we’d all be better off to recognize that this tendency is within all of us. One of the best examples of group mentality gone wrong is the Chinese Cultural Revolution under Chairman Mao Zedong. The revolution was intended to be a rebellion against the elitists and their unfair hierarchies, but in a group mentality, any nuanced thinking went out the window. Soon, anyone wearing clothing that resembled Western fashion was attacked in the streets as being part of the elite. As a result, a police state formed to try and control the chaos, and the revolution ended up achieving the opposite of what it set out to accomplish. To avoid such things from happening, we should all be part of what the author calls a Reality Group. You can think of this group as the gold standard in teamwork,  where everyone stays focused on the original goal, while also making sure the group doesn’t get caught up in power plays or pointless disputes. This structure focuses on the beneficial aspects of teamwork, and emphasizes that people can accomplish great things when they cooperate. Another unpleasant aspect of human nature is entitlement. Although all of us will feel entitled from time to time, there is no institution that represents this unfortunate trait more than royalty. For centuries, people have been expected to honor and worship individuals just because they are born into a certain family. Though many royals demand respect and authority automatically, one monarch in particular can teach us how to really earn it. Queen Elizabeth I stands out in history as one of the few who wanted to earn the respect and loyalty of her subjects. So she declined her income and used that money to help the people of England, and she only made decisions she believed were in the best interest of her people. What Elizabeth understood is that the entitlement of earlier monarchs only leads to resentment. So we should all prove ourselves worthy of admiration by working hard, owning up to our mistakes and making sacrifices when it’s in the greater interest. In the mid-nineteenth century, businessman Maurice Clark met an unassuming guy who came from a troubled background. This was John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller’s father had been a notorious con man who would often take off suddenly, leaving his family with barely enough money to keep from starving. Clark didn’t know it at the time, but Rockefeller’s childhood left him with an obsession for accumulating money and being in control of an orderly and predictable environment – the things he’d grown up without. All Clark saw was a guy who was deeply religious and had a knack for irritating him to no end. The two men had gone into business together, but Rockefeller was so irritating in pressuring Clark to expand the business that Clark agreed to sell his shares of the business at an auction, thereby playing right into Rockefeller’s hands. Rockefeller bought those shares and turned that small initial business into the Standard Oil Company, one of the most powerful companies ever created. Rockefeller was an aggressive businessman, but he was a sophisticated aggressor. He knew how to read people’s motivations and recognize what people would accept in order to get what he wanted. We all have some level of aggression in us – our aggressive nature helped make us the dominant species on the planet – and we shouldn’t try to repress this part of our personality, as it will lead to passive aggression. Repressed anger can also show up as an internal voice that projects the aggression inward, toward yourself. It’s better to accept healthy levels of aggression and find ways to put it to good use. The first step is to recognize where the aggression comes from. It might be due to insecurities, domineering parents, trauma from childhood or wanting to control your environment. Once we understand our aggression, we can direct it toward productive ends, like using it to fuel ambitions and realize goals. We can use it as energy to be tenacious and fearless in pursuing a higher purpose. Plus, when we better understand aggression, we can recognize it in others and know how people use it to hide their own vulnerabilities. This can help us defeat an aggressor, and there are few things in life more rewarding than outwitting a bully. Back in the fourteenth century, the Egyptian historian Ibn Khaldun suggested that generations run in a cycle of four different types. The first is a revolutionary generation that brings about great change, which is followed by a generation of order and stability. The third generation focuses on pragmatism and comfort, while the fourth generation is one of inquiry and cynicism. The trends in this pattern aren’t set in stone, but we can see how each generation is influenced and responds to the one that came before it. For example, in the first half of the twentieth century, the US had the Silent Generation, who grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression and fought in World War II. By and large, they practiced conservative values. They were followed by the Baby Boomers who rebelled against their conservative parents and blossomed in the counterculture movement of the 1960s and ‘70s. They were followed by Generation X, who chafed against the perceived hypocrisy of their parents and championed pragmatism and self-reliance. Then came the Millenials, who in turn champion teamwork rather than individualism, and generally oppose conflict and confrontation. Understanding how generational values influence decision-making is more important than ever. Nowadays, the world is highly connected, and it’s very likely that we’ll see trends that span the globe in future generations. So by understanding today’s historical context, we’ll be well positioned to understand the zeitgeist of tomorrow. Finally, one of the biggest influences on our decisions has always been our sense of mortality. It’s easy to understand why a person would prefer not to think about death. However, its incredible influence on us is precisely why we should think about it. It makes little sense to deny the inevitability of death, and when it’s embraced, it can serve as a great motivator for leading a productive and vibrant life. It’s also a great source of empathy, since death is the great equalizer that unites us all. When twentieth-century American writer Flannery O’Connor discovered she had the fatal disease of lupus, she didn’t despair. In fact, she became more empathetic, open-minded and enthusiastic about life. The Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky had a similar reaction after a near-death experience – he felt reborn, with a renewed sense of wonder. So stop going through life on autopilot, with an inward, distracted gaze. Recognize how amazing it is that we exist on this planet to begin with, and commit to doing something beautiful to honor this remarkable gift. The key message in these blinks: Human nature is full of laws that greatly influence our day-to-day lives. These include the laws of irrationality, narcissism, envy, shortsightedness, aggression and the denial of death. Some of these laws are aspects of the human condition that aren’t easy to accept. Once you do accept their existence, though, you can begin to improve your life. With a better understanding of human nature, you can recognize when emotions are leading to irrational decisions, or when your opinions are too influenced by groups and organizations. Understanding human nature is also a way to understand the commonalities between all humans, which can provide a much-needed boost to your empathy levels. Actionable advice: Be motivated by the sublime. Take a moment to consider all that happened in order for life to occur on this planet. Against great odds, the right conditions fell into place, one thing led to another and billions of years later here you are reading this sentence. To grasp the amazing chain of events that led to your conscious life, as well as all the mountains, oceans, plants and wildlife, is to grasp what’s known as the sublime. Your life is a wondrous thing and you should never lose sight of this. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But is it enough? Self-professed personal development devotee Hal Elrod isn’t so sure. After all, you can meditate, read and work out every day, and then . . . do nothing. Sure, you’ll be the most zen, knowledgeable and ripped you’ve ever been, but there’ll still be something missing: achievements.   And while there’s something to be said for relishing the journey itself, ultimately, it’s hitting targets that keeps us motivated. That washboard stomach and newfound fluency in Japanese just won’t mean that much if your bank account is still in the red, your relationships suck and you’re stuck in a job you hate. Leave those big issues unresolved and all those good habits are likely to end up falling by the wayside. So what’s the alternative? Well, you need to start harnessing the energy you’re expending on your personal development to a larger purpose. Call it a mission. That’s ultimately what’ll get you out of bed in the morning and give all those smaller self-improvement strategies their meaning. If that sounds like a tall order, don’t worry – in these blinks, we’ll lay out an actionable, step-by-step guide to creating and fulfilling your personal mission. Along the way, you’ll learn what The Matrix can teach us about self-belief; how to make yourself emotionally invincible; and why our brains limit our potential, and what we can do about it. One day, American jeweller Donnie Register found himself in the middle of a hold-up, with a gun pointed at his head. Things went south, and the robber pulled the trigger. The probability of that kind of shot ending in anything but instant death was pretty much zero, but luck was on Donnie’s side. He instinctively raised his hands, and the bullet was deflected by his gold wedding band, saving his life. That’s what we usually think of as a miracle: an extraordinary stroke of fortune that seems to come from on high. But it’s miracles like these that give the concept a bad name. As doubters are quick to point out, occurrences like Donnie’s narrow escape are incredibly rare. They’re also beyond our control – after all, if people knew how to simply conjure miraculous interventions we’d all have six-figure checks in our mailboxes and odds-defying health recoveries would be the norm. The author felt the same way for a long time. But here’s what he gradually realized: rational skepticism can easily turn into cynicism. What’s the difference? Well, the first is a healthy sign that you’re using your critical faculties to analyse the world around you. The latter, by contrast, is an irrational belief that your options are more limited than they really are. And that’s when you start dismissing the miracles you can control. People often assume that their most successful peers are incredibly “lucky,” as though the gods had personally ordained their achievements. But most highfliers don’t just sit around waiting for a random, passive miracle like Donnie’s: they actively create their own good fortune. That makes them miracle mavens, a term that goes back to the Hebrew word mebhin, meaning “one who knows.” Every era has its own mavens. Think of figures like John F. Kennedy, the first American president to put a man on the moon, or Martin Luther King, the civil rights leader who transformed the nation’s ideas about both itself and its black citizens. While others waited and prayed for a miracle, these go-getters went out there and made it happen. Let’s rewind back to Hal Elrod’s early twenties. He was just out of college and working as a sales rep for Cutco, a high-end kitchenware company. Up to that point, he’d been a pretty average kid, but he was beginning to hit his stride. That was down to his success in so-called “push periods” – Cutco’s 14-day sales contests. In early 2001, he’d just made $20,000 worth of sales in two consecutive pushes and was on the verge of breaking the company’s all-time sales record. All he needed to do was make the same amount in a third push. The only problem? The next contest was only ten days long. That meant he’d have to sell $2,000 worth of cutlery every day – something he’d never done before. Tossing and turning in his bed the night before the contest began, Elrod toyed with the idea of calling it quits. His self-doubt had almost gotten the better of him when he remembered something business guru Jim Rohn once said – namely, that the purpose of a goal isn’t achieving it but becoming the sort of person who even attempts it. That insight led to what the author calls the miracle equation. This consisted of two parts: first off, establishing unwavering faith that he could reach his goal; and second, making an extraordinary effort to ensure that outcome. As the final day approached, he’d made $17,024 in sales and had two appointments left. Making another three grand was a tall order, but it wasn’t impossible. But then disaster struck. The first client wasn’t home. Reaffirming his commitment to the miracle equation aloud, Elrod jumped back in his car and headed to his final meeting. And that’s when the miracle happened. The client Elrod intended on meeting had also forgotten her appointment, but her Swedish sister-in-law was in town. After listening to Elrod’s presentation, she commented on what a lucky coincidence it was that he’d turned up at just that moment. She and her husband had agreed to buy a new set of knives after their US trip, and they were also looking for a present for her brother, a keen amateur cook. She bought two of Cutco’s “Ultimate Sets” on the spot. That was enough to push Elrod over his $20,000 target!    As he drove away, he realized that he’d found the formula for achieving success and creating a remarkable life for himself and his family. Did you know that 27 publishers turned down Theodor Geisel, AKA Dr. Seuss – the children’s book author who later sold 600 million copies of his books worldwide? Or that record studios told Elvis Presley he couldn’t cut it in the music business and advised him to stick to driving trucks? What keeps miracle mavens going when they’re faced with rejection and setbacks is unwavering faith: the unshakeable belief that they possess the ability to make miracles. But where does that faith come from? Well, it’s what people sometimes call a “leap of faith.” That has two aspects. First, it’s a leap because there’s no other way of getting there – neither reason nor evidence provides a clear route to your destination. Secondly, it doesn’t come naturally. As we’ve seen, there are all kinds of obstacles to self-belief. That means it has to be consciously established in a moment of decision.   To see how that works, think of the first Matrix movie. You might remember Laurence Fishburne’s character, Morpheus, telling Keanu Reeve’s character, Neo, that he was “the one.” Neo doesn’t believe it, and falls short of his potential during his virtual training exercises. The key moment comes when Neo finally accepts that Morpheus is telling the truth - only then can he begin mastering his untapped abilities. The plot of your life will mirror that of the movie when you make your own decision to believe; once you’ve accepted that you’re as deserving and talented as anyone on Earth, your limitless potential will become apparent. Before you get there, though, you can draw faith from a couple of other sources. One is religion or spirituality. Take Rister Ratemo, a 14-year-old Kenyan girl who was close to going blind. Cultural proscriptions against taking another person’s body parts meant she couldn’t have the operation she needed – a corneal transplant – in Kenya. Her unwavering belief in God gave her the courage to board a plane and fly alone to the US, where she received the treatment she needed. Then there are mentors. Before discovering the miracle equation, the author struggled with confidence issues. His Cutco mentor Jesse Levine, however, had an unshakable belief in his protégé’s abilities. At first, Elrod thought Jesse had simply made a mistake. But over time, that unwavering faith began to rub off on Elrod. Maybe, he started thinking, Jesse was right after all. Eventually, he became convinced that he really was capable of doing anything he put his mind to! By this point you might be champing at the bit to start applying the miracle equation to your own life. But hold on a second – before we do that, we’ll need to take care of a couple of common psychological logjams that get in the way of unwavering faith and extraordinary effort. Let’s start with limitations. Think back to your childhood: What did you want to be when you grew up? Chances are, you set your sights high. Kids dream of becoming famous ballerinas or baseball players. When we’re young, everything seems possible. Over time, however, the world becomes smaller, and we find ourselves hemmed in by self-imposed limitations. That’s partly down to the way the adult human brain functions. When you get down to it, it’s a pretty ancient piece of our wiring. Like our prehistoric ancestors, we’re constantly scanning our environment for signs of danger. That’s rational enough if you’re a caveman – after all, if you’re not on your toes you might just end up being mauled by a mountain lion. Unfortunately, our brains aren’t very good at telling the difference between the anxiety triggered by a charging mammoth and, say, the prospect of moving to a new city for a job. That means we end up irrationally rejecting opportunities.    Then there’s the worldview we learn from the society around us. We’re constantly told what is and what isn’t possible. Eventually, we settle for second best rather than pursuing our dreams because they’re “unrealistic.” But here’s the thing: there aren’t any hard limits on what any of us can do. Experts claimed no one could ever run a mile in under four minutes – until the British athlete Roger Bannister came along and did exactly that in 1954. Then less than two months later, another runner called John Landy broke Bannister’s record! So how can we break out of these self-limiting patterns? Well, we need to start defining ourselves. That’s not so much about rejecting social labels as it is about refusing to see them as brakes on our capabilities. The author, for example, has been diagnosed with ADHD, but he refuses to let this diagnosis limit him. After all, ADHD makes focusing on tasks harder, but not impossible. And far from being a limit, it even has its upsides – after all, bouncing from one idea to the next can also be a highly effective creative strategy! When the author was 20, he was involved in a near-fatal car crash after being hit head-on by a drunk driver going 70 miles an hour. What did the most damage, though, was being broadsided by a second vehicle. That collision broke eleven bones, including Elrod’s femur, eye socket and pelvis. His heart stopped for a full six minutes and he almost bled to death, leaving him in a coma. When he woke, he was told he’d probably never walk again. His doctors expected him to fall into a profound depression. But after a moment of deep reflection, Elrod surprised them with his upbeat response. He laughed, cracked jokes and seemed to be in high spirits. That, the medical staff thought, must be a form of denial. Worried that he was repressing his emotions, they asked his parents to talk to him. That’s when the author explained the five-minute rule.   That’s something he learned from his Cutco mentor Jesse Levine. By the time of the crash, Elrod had been applying it every day for nearly two years. Here’s how it works: it’s okay to feel bad when things go wrong, but not for more than five minutes. When you suffer a setback, you set a timer and do whatever you need to – scream, cry, kvetch or punch a wall. Then, when the time’s up, you say, “Can’t change it” aloud and move on. The reason the rule is so effective is because it taps into a powerful truth: emotional pain isn’t caused by external events that are beyond our control, but by our responses. Wallowing, in other words, is a choice that keeps us trapped in experiences we’re powerless to alter. Letting go and accepting them, by contrast, lets us move on. In Elrod’s case, it meant he could fully focus on his recovery and, eventually, regain the use of his legs. But remember, getting to this stage takes time and constant practice. The best way to start is to use it to deal with those niggling bugbears that can ruin a working day. Elrod, for example, started applying the rule to get over frustrations like a client cancelling an order at the last minute. So – received a rude email from a colleague? Hit the timer, stew a little and move on! Now that we’ve taken a look at overcoming the brain’s inbuilt limitations and toughening your emotional armor, it’s time to talk about goals. Chances are, you’ve got lots  – we all do. But here’s the issue: if you don’t prioritize, you won’t achieve any of them. In fact, attempting to tackle all your goals at once is the most common obstacle to progress. There just isn’t enough time to work on your health, family, finances, career and relationships simultaneously. Try it and you’ll be plenty busy but failing to make anything but the most inconsequential gains. It’ll leave you frustrated and ready to call the whole thing off. While focusing on a single goal for six months might get you halfway to the finish line, divide your energies among five or six projects and you’ll barely scratch the surface of any one individual goal. There’s a good reason for that: as a 2009 Stanford University study shows, multitasking overloads our brains and makes us less efficient. Flitting among different tasks makes it harder to screen out non-essential information and dulls our memories. That’s why you need a mission – an overarching end toward which your efforts are directed. To get a handle on that, think of Olympic athletes. If you want to compete at the highest level, you need to choose a single sport. And while you’ll work on various things – stamina, technique, diet and so on – everything supports the primary objective: winning gold in your chosen sport. So what is your mission? Here you’ll want to grab a pen and paper and write out all your goals for the next half year. Now take a look at that list and ask yourself this question: Which one of those goals would help you develop the qualities and skills you’d need to fulfill all your dreams? You might, for example, decide that running a marathon would require the kind of dedication and self-belief that you’re also lacking in your career or love life. Okay, you’ve nailed down your highest priority. Don’t worry if it sounds like a tall order right now – as the quasi-military terminology suggests, missions are serious business! In the next blink, we’ll talk about some safety nets that’ll help support you as you move forward. In this blink, we’ll be focusing on inching your mission from possible toward probable. The greater your progress on that front, the more likely it is that you’ll stay engaged and committed. Ready? Great – let’s explore some support strategies you can start using today. If you’ve ever made New Year’s resolutions, you’ll know that a year is a long time. That might sound like a boon, but it can actually be a curse. That’s because it’s simply too much time: if you pursue a goal over such an extended time span, you’re likely to lose your sense of urgency. After all, if you haven’t started that diet by the end of February, you’ve always got another ten months, right? Well, no. The overly optimistic thought that “I’ve got plenty of time left” tricks us into postponing important decisions. So what if you gave yourself one month rather than twelve to accomplish your goals? Here’s how it works: instead of focusing on an annual target, you set yourself monthly goals that cumulatively bring you closer to fulfilling your mission. This has two benefits. First off, it breaks tasks down into bite-sized portions – aiming to write a business plan over four weeks, for example, sounds a lot less intimidating than “set up my own business”! Secondly, it gives you a healthy sense of urgency and can cut out procrastination. And here’s the second way you can give yourself a safety net as you pursue your mission: engineer your environment. That’s all about removing goal-deterring obstacles from your day-to-day surroundings. So say you’ve decided to shed twenty pounds over the next year. One way of making life easier for yourself would be to make sure your pantry isn’t stocked with cookies and soda. Want to meditate every morning? Don’t keep your attention-grabbing smartphone on the bedside table. If you want to hit the gym after work, by contrast, think about keeping your gear in the trunk of your car or changing before you leave the office. These little hacks are especially important because, as we’ve seen, time isn’t on your side: if you want to meet your targets, you’ll need to be working toward your goals every day. That brings us almost to the end of our journey. In this blink, we’ll wrap up with some tips to help you with the second part of the miracle equation – extraordinary effort. But let’s start out by clearing up a possible misconception: despite the name, this isn’t about heroic Herculean labors. In fact, bringing your miracle to fruition is all about constantly repeating small steps. That has a couple of components. The first thing you’ll need to do is predetermine your process. What that means is figuring out which steps, if taken again and again, will lead to the fulfilment of your mission. That’s what Hal Elrod did back at Cutco. Once he’d set his $20,000 push target, he called colleagues who’d already achieved that in the past with a list of questions he’d prepared beforehand. Their answer? Consistency pays. Rather than using newfangled sales hacks, they were hitting their phones every day at the same time and making the same number of calls. That isn’t just a piece of sales wisdom, however. Whether you’re writing a book or aiming to lose weight, breaking your process down into “micro” steps makes your “macro” mission seem a lot less scary. Elrod, for example, wrote the The Miracle Equation by sitting down and getting 1,000 words onto the page every day.  To find how to predetermine your process, you can start with Google, or, if that fails to turn up any insights, check out Amazon’s best-selling titles on your topic of interest. Your best bet, however, is to ask folks who are in the know, like the author did. The next step is to schedule your process. If you’ve ever bought a big stack of books on a new subject you’ve just gotten into only to watch them gather dust on your shelf, or joined a gym you never ended up going to, you’ll know that life has a tendency to get in the way of our grand ambitions. That means you need to add slots to your diary – physically or digitally – that are dedicated exclusively to your mission. If your calendar is already overloaded with commitments, consider simplifying it and using online delivery services to take care of time-consuming chores like grocery shopping. If you’ve come this far, well done – you’re now set to pursue your mission. So find the time to work on it and begin discovering your true potential! The key message in these blinks: Miracles come in different shapes and sizes. Some are what the insurance industry calls “acts of God” and beyond all human control.

In the 1970s, the average American saw around 500 adverts a day. Today, it’s closer to 5,000. It doesn’t matter what’s being sold, all ads tell consumers the same thing: buy more and you’ll be happier. That’s the message companies in the US paid an astonishing $171 billion for in 2013. It’s an effective tactic: the typical household now owns 300,000 items. This addiction to consumption, Joshua Becker argues, is a problem. We can’t buy our way to happiness. In fact, what we usually end up with is clutter that drains our resources and distracts us from the things that really matter. So what’s the solution? In a word, minimalism. A growing movement that’s captured the imagination of millions of people tired of endless consumption. It’s a lifestyle choice that takes the old saying that “less is more” to heart. Decluttering isn’t just about freeing up extra space in our closets and garages, though – it’s about redirecting our time, energy and money to the things that really make life worth living. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why advertising is so effective at convincing us to buy even more things; how to decide which objects to part with and which to keep; and how to turn your family onto the minimalist lifestyle. Have you ever looked around your home and felt overwhelmed by just how much stuff you have? You’re not alone. Millions of people slave away to buy the latest gadget only to end up feeling just as dissatisfied as before. But things are starting to change. There’s a new movement on the horizon that’s taking on mindless consumer culture and embracing a more fulfilling life: minimalism. Its aim is to help you get rid of unnecessary possessions that stop you devoting your energies to doing the things that matter most. The author embraced minimalism during the Memorial Day weekend of 2008. That was when he suddenly realized that consumerism was stopping him living his best life. This revelation came after he’d decided to sort through his family’s cluttered garage. It was supposed to be a quick affair, but it ended up taking hours of hard graft. As he was sorting and cleaning, he thought back to all the other times he’d tried to impose order on his belongings. Why had he always come away from those cleaning stints feeling so despondent? Just as he was pondering that question, his neighbor stopped by. Noticing his frustration, she told him about her daughter who’d just become a minimalist and was always reminding her that she didn’t need all of the things she owned. That was an epiphany. There he was, wasting his time in the garage sorting through unneeded things rather than spending quality time with his family! After talking it through with his wife, he decided to start reducing the number of things he owned. He then set up Becoming Minimalist, a blog that documented his new clutter-free lifestyle. The site clearly touched a nerve. Today, it has over one million monthly readers and has converted thousands of people to minimalism. In the following blinks, we’ll take a closer look at what minimalism is all about. As you’ll see, the popular perception that it’s about depriving yourself of the good things in life is wide of the mark. What is minimalism? Chances are, you’re picturing spartan interiors and a lifestyle that does away with objects for its own sake. But minimalism isn’t about self-denial. In fact, minimalists get much more out of their lives. For example, do you want more flexibility in your life? Many minimalists have discovered that decluttering their homes means they are free to work and live wherever they want. Take freelance journalist Annette Gartland. She felt suffocated by all the stuff she’d acquired over the years, especially when she returned home from lengthy trips abroad. In 2013 she made a radical decision: she decided to become a minimalist. After three months of hard work, she managed to pare her belongings down to just a few boxes and sold her house and car.   She hasn’t looked back. Today she lives the free-spirited life of a global nomad, spending most her time in Southeast Asia where she lives in apartment shares, housesits and hotels. But you don’t need to travel to the ends of the earth to reap the rewards of minimalism. It’s a lifestyle that can also help you focus on what’s already right in front of your nose. When Dave and Sheryl’s kids left home, the couple took a long-overdue road trip from their home in Oregon down to the West Coast. While on the road, they happened to catch a podcast about minimalism. It changed their lives. Money wasn’t a real issue for them but they realized that their upper-middle-class dream home was eating up more of their resources than necessary. Did they really need that perfect couch for their living room? Wouldn’t they be better spending that money on their family, health and faith? When they got home, they put the plan they’d hatched during their road trip into action. They sold half of their belongings and downsized to a smaller home across the street. The move soon paid off. Dave suddenly had more time for their family and church and even took up writing. Sheryl freed up some valuable headspace to think about her legal career, eventually deciding to specialize in mediation rather than litigation. This is a great example of how minimalism can change your life. But remember, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. So read on to discover what kind of minimalism might work for you. Adverts are everywhere. Whether you’re online, watching TV or driving through town, you see thousands of ads every day. So how much influence do they really have? If you want to understand your spending habits, it’s a good idea to look at consumer culture and the roles of marketing and advertising. The big picture is this: Americans are buying more today than ever before. Take Anthony and Amy. They had always wanted to go on a family vacation but somehow never seemed to have enough money. Amy had a suspicion about where all their cash was going. How much, she wondered, did their Amazon orders add up to? The pair weren’t spending extravagantly. Most of their orders were for small items and came to less than $40. However, adding everything up told a different story: they’d spent more than $10,000 over four years! Anthony and Amy’s behavior is part of a much wider epidemic of excessive consumerism. The average American household owns twice as much as it did 50 years ago. Today, a normal house contains something like 300,000 individual items. No wonder average home sizes have tripled and one in ten people rent a separate storage unit. So how did we get here as a society? You don’t have to look far for the answer. Spending habits are massively influenced by marketing and advertising. Think of sale items. They’re much more likely to find a buyer than regular products. That was something JCPenney’s CEO learned after getting rid of special offers and simply reducing the price of all products. With no sales promotions, purchases and profits plummeted, and the CEO was soon looking for a new job. But the best evidence of the effectiveness of marketing is just how much companies fork out for advertising. After all, you don’t spend $171 billion – as they did in 2013 – on something you merely hope might work! Understanding the power and influence of advertising – and remembering not to be unduly influenced by it – is one of the first steps toward a minimalist lifestyle. If you’re thinking of adopting the minimalist lifestyle, you might be wondering where to start. After all, the prospect of going through all that stuff or fighting with the kids about their old toys can be pretty daunting. It’s true that the path to minimalism isn’t an easy one. That said, there are some strategies that can help get you there. The best place to begin your journey is to be clear about why you want to reach your destination in the first place. What is it, in other words, that minimalism can offer you? There are all sorts of answers. Perhaps spending less money on clothing will free up extra resources to think about your career. Or maybe saving some extra cash every month will put you on track toward the early retirement you’ve always dreamed about. It’s important to ask yourself this question because minimalism isn’t just about decluttering – it’s about focusing on the things you really care about. The next step on your journey is dividing your belongings into different categories. Begin by identifying the things that are the easiest to part with. The tough decisions about objects of sentimental value can wait. That’s exactly what the author did. Once he’d decided to go minimalist, he started with his car. It was full of useless clutter like old CDs, small toys and unworn sunglasses – exactly the kind of things that are easy to clear out without too much heartache. Soon his car was clutter-free, with only essentials like the proof of insurance remaining. So that’s how you start becoming a minimalist. Articulate your reasons and start by throwing out the things that matter least to you! So you’ve ditched your least meaningful belongings. Now comes the tricky part: deciding what to do with objects of sentimental value. It’s normal to worry about clearing out things associated with precious memories or regretting throwing something out after it’s already gone. Therefore, your best bet is to take a systematic approach to decluttering. That way you’ll find an approach to minimalism that really works for you. Here are a few tips. First off, go through your sentimental objects and decide what’s most important. One thing lots of budding minimalists ask the author is what they should do with their books. The idea of losing a library that you’ve slowly built up over the years is an uncomfortable one. Doesn’t every volume tell a story about your life? Well, no. Books don’t define who you are. People usually keep them for all sorts of reasons that have nothing to do with sentimental value – they want to show how well-read they are or think they might need them for future reference. But that won’t make you happy. So keep your absolute favorites and give the rest away. That act of kindness really will contribute to your happiness! If you’re worried that you’ll end up regretting your decision to toss something, try living without it for a while. When Courtney Carver was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, she started working on cutting out sources of stress in her life to prevent the condition from advancing. She realized that all the stuff she’d accumulated over the years as an avid shopper was a major source of stress – not, as she’d previously thought, a form of stress relief! Concerned that she’d part with something she actually wanted to keep, she began to experiment. She removed various objects from her house for a few months. If she didn’t miss them, they could go. She also applied this principle to her wardrobe, launching something she called Project 333. That involved selecting 33 items of clothing, excluding essentials like underwear, and keeping them in her closet for three months. Once she realized she didn’t need the clothes that had been stored away, she donated them. Hundreds and thousands of people who’ve used these kinds of strategies have realized that it’s possible to live in an uncluttered home without waking up to find that they have nothing to wear! You’ve taken the plunge and decided to embrace minimalism – great! Now it’s time to learn to navigate the vast oceans of consumerism in your minimalist boat. Like captaining any vessel, it takes a sure hand and a strong sense of orientation. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can start changing your buying habits and avoid the choppy waters of consumption-driven public holidays. If you find it hard to resist the constant temptation to buy things, try taking a break from shopping altogether. That’s what Sarah Peck did. An Ivy League graduate with a good job in San Francisco, she was regularly getting to the end of the month with very little money left. Sarah realized that a large part of the problem was her taste for expensive clothes. Dropping $400 on a new outfit had become second nature – hardly surprising for someone with a good income living in such a fashion-conscious society! She decided to select her favorite clothes from her wardrobe and throw away the rest. The next step? Take a year-long break from shopping. It was an empowering choice. She suddenly had more time and money to spend on athletics and hanging out with her friends. Another way to maintain your minimalist lifestyle is to let people know in advance what gifts you’d like to receive. A commitment to minimalism doesn’t have to sour the holiday spirit, but you can avoid accumulating unwanted possessions by telling the non-minimalists in your life what you’d like for Christmas. Take the author. Gift-giving made him anxious at first. He didn’t want to be a Scrooge-like presence over the holidays complaining about consumer culture. But he also didn’t want any useless gifts. The solution to the dilemma was simple: being proactive and telling his wife what he actually needed. In his case, it was the gym membership he’d been meaning to take out for ages. It turned out to be a great gift as he was able to concentrate on his health and fitness for the first time in years. If you don’t want any gifts, just remember that you can always ask your loved ones to make a donation to a charity of your choice. Suggesting alternatives rather than refusing presents is a great way of setting an example without burning bridges. Few things are more satisfying than helping others. And unlike the endless accumulation of possessions, generosity isn’t a quick fix; it’s a source of long-lasting contentment. That’s why you should think about donating your old belongings to a charity rather than trying to sell them. When the author decided to go minimalist and declutter his house, he and his wife put their old stuff up on eBay and held a yard sale. They were convinced all those CDs, decorations and clothes they’d bought over the years would make them a pretty penny. Their takings after all that effort? A measly $135. That got them thinking. They didn’t really need the money but there were thousands of people out there who desperately needed the kind of items they’d been selling. So they reached out to a couple of local charities and started donating their old possessions. Compared to hawking them for spare change, it was a joyous and fulfilling experience. Giving plays an important role in minimalism. You can even use your extra money and time to become an intentionally generous person. That’s something Ali realized in 2007. A pastor had posed a question at a church retreat: what can individuals do to improve the world? Ali had a revelation. Her wedding ring could probably feed an entire village in some parts of Africa. After discussing it with her husband, Ali decided to sell her ring and donate the money to a charity that drills wells in sub-Saharan Africa. One thing led to another and Ali’s friends were soon doing the same with their wedding rings! Today Ali heads up With This Ring, a nonprofit organization which helps to provide clean drinking water for thousands of people. That’s a great example of the way in which rejecting endless consumerism can help you lead a more fulfilling and giving life! If you’re already on board with the minimalist lifestyle by this point, you might be wondering how it might fit in with your family. One common misconception is that minimalism is all about saying no to your kids’ requests for new toys. But minimalism and parenting is much more than that. In fact, it’s all about helping your children develop healthy consumption habits early on in life. That means establishing boundaries. Take the author and his wife. They made a deal with their daughter. She’s allowed to have as many toys as she likes, as long as they fit into her closet. The same goes for art projects. As long as everything fits into the plastic container under her bed, she can keep as many materials as she wants. That encourages her to make decisions about her belongings and ask herself what she really needs. You can also show your children that these boundaries have concrete benefits. Money that’s been saved by buying less, for example, can be invested in meaningful shared experiences like a family vacation. That’s far more valuable than a new toy! But it’s also important to remember to be patient. The people around you might need a bit longer than you to fully embrace minimalism. The author once received an email from a recent convert to the minimalist lifestyle. She asked him whether she should divorce her husband because of his reluctance to adapt to the lifestyle. He reminded her that the aim of minimalism is to bring people together rather than tear them apart. She just needed to be more patient. Cultivating a minimalist family doesn’t always work perfectly. The important thing is to take it slow and lead by example rather than trying to force a new way of life on your loved ones. The key message in these blinks: Although we think that we are immune to advertisements, our buying habits are a product of larger trends in consumption. Minimalism doesn’t have to be about creating an extreme lifestyle; it’s about becoming more generous, offering your children boundaries and spending more time and money on what we actually care about. Actionable advice: Do those two-minute jobs right now.  Clutter often builds up because of procrastination. Instead of compiling a list of things to do, simply go about completing the jobs that you know will probably only take a few minutes. Clean dishes right away or put your used clothes in a laundry bin now rather than waiting for a pile to form. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What inspires you to greet the day and live a fulfilling life? In a word, motivation. Motivation is the power to achieve the things you want in life. You need to be motivated to pursue anything, from simple daily goals to lifelong dreams. People who are deeply motivated are also influential, achieving their own goals while motivating others. These blinks teach you how you too can become both motivated and a powerful motivator, but what you’ll find here isn’t just another feel-good motivational rant. This is a manifesto – a call to make a serious commitment to finding a focused purpose and pursuing the things you love. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why being fearful is like keeping a wolf as a house pet; why you should never feel “just fine”; and how to recapture the wide-eyed joy of childhood. Does it ever seem to you like there’s always something stopping you from being completely free? If so, you’re not alone. We all feel frustrated when we sense our freedom is curtailed. But why do we feel this way? Without personal freedom, we can’t realize our potential as an individual or as a society. And when we stop demanding the freedom we need, life rapidly loses all its vigor and drive and we become slaves to the wants and expectations of others. This lack of freedom can easily spiral out of control, doing serious damage not only to people but also to entire societies. Just think of atrocities such as the Holocaust, in which many people stood idly by in fear as thousands had their freedom cruelly taken from them. Even today many of us still feel oppressed, worrying about what other people think and afraid to pursue what we really want from life.   So how can you overcome your obstacles to reach whole new levels of joy and fulfillment? The only way to attain personal freedom is to overcome fear. Fear is a powerful part of the human psyche. In our evolutionary past, fear served us well, keeping us from danger. But how does fear benefit us today, in the modern world? You might hear people say, “Fear is natural,” or “Fear makes you work harder.” Sure, this may be true at times. But in most cases it isn’t. In fact, pretending that fear is our friend is rather like having a wolf as a pet. Sooner or later, this wild animal will turn on us and eat us alive! Ever met someone brimming with energy, full of purpose and life? You might think they were born that way, but this is simply not true. We can all pump up our motivation by first reflecting on our true ambitions. Ambition is simply the choice to seek out something greater in life, through more experience or higher achievement. Without ambition, your life is nothing but a ship, drifting aimlessly over a vast sea. But with ambition, you can set goals that you really want to reach. So how do you kindle your ambition? You need to always ask yourself questions. For example, if you’ve been toiling away at a job for too long, ask yourself: “Is this the best job I could have?” Or if you feel trapped in a stagnant relationship, ask yourself: “Is this the best marriage I could have?” Asking yourself questions can draw your attention to ambitions you might otherwise ignore. It’s also important to remember that having ambition is different than having hope, the difference being a question of expectancy. But what does that mean, exactly?   Say you dream of completing a triathlon. While daunting, you’ve always hoped to get in enough shape to one day achieve it. But with this perspective, you’ll never make it. Hope just isn’t enough – you have to visualize yourself in the water, on your bike, in your new running shoes, actually participating and in the end, crossing the finish line. In other words, you have to expect that you will succeed. This truly is the spark of motivation! Yet once you’ve kindled your motivation, you need to keep it burning. How do you do this? Motivation needs fuel, and that fuel is continuous effort. We all have days when we’d rather curl up in bed and do nothing. But through developing solid routines and surrounding ourselves with strong support systems, you’ll be able to jump out of bed and into your running shoes – even when you’d rather hit the snooze button! Children live in the moment, looking at the world as it is now, seizing every second to explore and play and push boundaries. It is an exhilarating and freeing perspective on life! Yet as we become adults, we often lose this ability to see the world in this way. Too many of us are obsessed with the past. Some people are always looking backwards, to what they believe was a happier time, thinking, “If only life could be like that again, I’d be happier.” Others see the past as the cause of all of today’s problems, and spend hours thinking, “If only that hadn’t happened, I’d be happier.” With such a perspective, the present moment is tainted by the sadness of what could have been. Obsessing about the past closes us off from the world and drains our motivation. So how can you break this vicious cycle of sadness and regret? Ask yourself, “What in my life could I focus on right now to feel enthusiastic and appreciative?” Don’t just do it once – make it a mantra that you repeat. The more you consider this question, the easier it will be to truly live in the moment. With this approach, being happy is something you can practice. If you want to live life to the fullest, you’ve got to work at being joyful and curious! Happiness isn’t something that “just happens,” a state of being outside of your control. Thinking this way pushes you toward negativity, or dark feelings that can be contagious. Yet negativity isn’t the only thing that’s contagious; happiness is as well! Think about the last time you spent an afternoon surrounded by children playing – you won’t find better teachers of joy. Learn to ask: “What if I tried every day to look at the world with the curiosity and presence of a child?” We’ve all got inner demons. They lurk in the shadows of our minds, keeping us from achieving what we really want. Fortunately, these monsters can be conquered. All we need are the right weapons. When starting a new project, you might ask, “Is this really a good idea?” Or perhaps, “Can I really pull this off?” If we let doubt take over, our motivation can disappear. There is only one cure: faith. Not an institutionalized faith, but a humble kind of faith that lives in you and strengthens you when you feel doubt. Tell yourself, “If I work hard and dedicate all my efforts to my task, in time I will achieve my dreams.” By having faith in yourself and shaping your thoughts, you will find that it is easier to work steadily toward your goals. But what if your goals seem impossible, perhaps even a little crazy? Keep in mind that no great innovation has ever come about by taking a safer road. To contribute to the world, sometimes we need to be a little reckless and perhaps a little bit crazy. But the sort of recklessness you need – the kind that will serve you best – is the willingness to challenge what you take for granted and to keep seeking out something truly new. To do this, you’ll need to realize that you can actually bend reality to your will. Your life is not carved in stone. If you put your mind to it, you can change it. Great men and women throughout centuries have pulled their motivation from this realization! The U.S. moon landing in the 1960s is a great example. At the time, sending a man to the moon seemed impossible, if not dangerous. But the project was a success, and from that moment, changed the world’s idea of what is possible. When you do what you love, it’s not just your happiness that grows. You’ll also radiate good energy and even inspire others. Everyone has the potential to become a beacon of hope for other people, and this role is something for which you should strive. But how do you do this? It’s simple. Do what you are passionate about. When you’re asked how you’re feeling, do you often say, “I’m fine.” But is fine really the best you can do? Why aren’t you fantastic, great or phenomenal? If you had more time to do the things you really enjoy and that make you feel proud of yourself, you could live a life that transcends “just fine.” Try asking yourself if the people closest to you, your family, friends and colleagues, know what your true passions are. If they don’t, it probably means you’re not realizing who you truly are inside. Don’t let your life be dictated by what other people want you to do! If you allow others to pen you in and keep you from your passions, your integrity and dignity will suffer. You need to say “no” to doing anything that goes against your passions, no matter what the price. Today’s world is full of conflict and poverty. Yet at the same time, apathy is widespread. Ours is a world in desperate need of role models and inspiring leaders. So why look to others to fill this void? We must realize that we can all play that role; that we can all inspire.   Yet perhaps you don’t think yourself a leader, or capable of telling other people what to do. Remember this: great leaders don’t tell people what to do; they inspire them to find their path. The key message in this book: To remember the key lessons from these blinks, just keep in mind the six F's of motivation: Forget the past, Fuel the fire of your motivation, have Faith in yourself and strive for Fantastic things, never forgetting that Freedom and Fear are your primal motivators. Actionable advice: Be patient!  Being impatient can drain energy and motivation. When you are feeling impatient, try to ask yourself: “What could I do to calm myself down right now?” or “Why does this kind of situation always make me impatient?” To follow up, ask: “How will I handle a situation like this next time?” Take a deep breath, and you’ll feel positive energy flooding back again!

In these blinks, you’ll learn how passion and drug addiction aren’t so different from each other; why many other self-help books on living a balanced life have it wrong; and how the dark side of passion contributed to energy giant Enron going bust. The story of passion is one that stretches back a long way. Although nowadays we tend to view passion as a term with positive attributes, this wasn’t always the case. Passion finds its linguistic roots in the Latin “passio,” which literally means “suffering.” For much of its history, this suffering was exclusively associated with the passion of one person – Jesus Christ. But, as for many other words, passion’s meaning changed over time. By the Middle Ages, passion was also being used to refer to the suffering of people other than Christ. And by the Renaissance, the term slowly took on non-negative connotations. Poets like Geoffrey Chaucer began to use the word to describe surging emotions in general, and it was Shakespeare who finally used the term in a more positive light to describe the uncontrollable desire one feels for another person. The story of the term doesn’t end there, however. It took another couple of centuries for the meaning of passion to extend beyond people to activities or career choices. By the 1970s, phrases like “follow your passion” had begun to emerge; passion-seeking had finally become an important part of the average person’s life. And the concept has only become more important since then, with Generation X and Millennials even more enthralled by fulfilling their personal passions than their baby-boomer predecessors. Just like the word “passion,” the biological mechanisms of passion itself have both positive and negative connotations. That’s because passion is regulated by dopamine, a powerful neurochemical that motivates us to do things. Once released by the brain, dopamine pushes us toward our goals and makes us crave rewards. Dopamine drives passionate people in their pursuits but also motivates drug addicts to satisfy their cravings. Only the finest of lines exists between the personalities of extremely passionate people and those of drug addicts. That’s because while dopamine motivates us to pursue rewards, the chemical dissipates once we receive them. This, of course, leaves us yearning for more. And, as with addictive drugs, the more dopamine we experience, the higher our tolerance for it becomes. We begin to set our goals higher and place ever-increasing importance on chasing our passions. And we’re never satisfied with the reward; it’s the process of reaching the reward that releases that sweet dopamine. If the biological mechanisms that kindle a passion aren’t so removed from those of drug addiction, it’s probably important to consider the method by which we find – and grow – our passions. Look at passion in the context of romance. We often think we’re destined to fall in love with our soul-mate and that we’ll only be able to truly love that one person. But searching for “the one” can lead to an impossible quest for finding the perfect fit, an all-or-nothing approach that passion researchers call the fit mind-set. Studies show that 78 percent of us think this way – and not just when it comes to romance. We think we need to feel passion immediately after starting a new job or activity and that this is the only way that new pursuits can result in long-term happiness. But, whether in romance or work, the fit mind-set has its pitfalls. For starters, people with this mind-set are prone to giving up new pursuits when they hit the first obstacle. Then they search for something new to try, seeking the fleeting pleasure of the initial dopamine rush that comes with starting fresh. What they don’t realize is that with each restart, they’re sacrificing possibilities for long-term growth. But if the fit mind-set isn’t the best way to kindle your passion, what’s the alternative? Well, instead of going all in from the get-go, consider a more incremental approach. Identify potential hobbies or lines of work that you find interesting and slowly begin to explore whether or not you can see yourself engaging in them over the long term. If so, it’s important to accept that you won’t find perfection right away. That helps regulate your brain's production of dopamine to a more reasonable level. Then when you make initial mistakes, and your dopamine levels reduce, your mood won't feel like it's dropping off a cliff. As you get better at your chosen pursuit, incrementally increase the energy and time you put into it. The more competent you get at your passion, the more risks you can begin to take. Eventually, you can contemplate the biggest risk of all – quitting your day job and going all in on your passion! Cultivating your passion with an incremental approach rather than a fit mind-set is much more likely to be a successful approach. You’ll be committing real time and energy to it rather than giving up at the first sign of difficulty. There was once a CEO of a major company who valued passion above everything else. He only employed the most passionate people, and he expected his whole organization to emulate his high level of performance. Under his stewardship, Fortune named the organization America’s “most innovative large company,” and it was valued at $60 billion. This company was called Enron, and its CEO was Jeffrey Skilling. But Enron no longer exists, as Skilling’s relentless passion for enriching both himself and Enron’s shareholders led to one of the biggest corporate fraud cases in modern history. When the dust settled, Skilling was behind bars and Enron had declared bankruptcy. Skilling is now a convicted felon and a classic example of what happens when our passions become obsessive and go awry as a result. This shift begins when we lose sight of what originally motivated us to work toward our goals and become increasingly focused on things like external validation, rewards or recognition. And when these things replace our original goals, we’ll go to any lengths to achieve them. Whether it be writers engaging in plagiarism to get that book published or athletes using illegal substances to set new records, these sorts of obsessive passions can turn initially joyful pursuits into sinister undertakings. Remember how kindling a passion and developing a drug addiction both involve increasing tolerance to dopamine? Well, that’s precisely where such obsessive passions can begin. We think that more money or recognition will satisfy our cravings, but as dopamine is only released during the process and not upon reaching the goal, it’s never enough – we always crave more. And just like when a drug addict goes cold turkey, when people with obsessive passions fail, the sudden, massive drop in dopamine can trigger devastation and depression. This is the point where our passion has morphed back into its original Latin meaning – suffering. Another unhealthy driver of passion is fear. In the short term, fear of failure can be a useful motivator. If you’ve just started a new job, for example, fear of messing things up at the beginning may help you to learn your way around the position quickly. But in the long run, fear of failure also leads to burnouts and depression. Luckily, if you feel your passion is becoming obsessive or fueled by fear, there are a number of techniques that can help – we’ll explore these next. The sad truth is that our fast-paced, results-driven modern society can often cause our passions to become obsessive or driven by fear. This is because we often favor quick fixes over long-term skill development, and instant social media “likes” have become the new currency of recognition for our efforts. All in all, it can be hard to slow down and enjoy our passions purely for their own sake. This is where the pursuit of harmonious passions comes in. We engage in harmonious passions only for the joy they bring us, not for the potential rewards or recognition that their obsessive or fear-fueled cousins require. And it turns out that when we do this, we’re actually more likely to attain those external rewards and reach our goals. But here’s the crux – this only works when the pursuit of our passion is an end in itself. Those who focus on future successes instead of enjoying their passion are less likely to achieve their goals and reap the rewards. This, in a nutshell, is the passion paradox. Luckily, it's possible to cultivate a harmonious passion by adopting a mastery mind-set that focuses on continuously and sustainably developing your passions. There are a few basic principles to it – for one, focusing on the process rather than the results. That means that rather than obsessing over your goal and despairing at how far you are from attaining it, you focus on and take pride in all your small achievements along the way. This helps you stay motivated as you continue steadily on toward mastery. Another part of the mastery mind-set is harnessing the timeless virtue of patience. The road to mastery will involve peaks and troughs, and when you’re suffering through a low point, it’s important to step back and embrace patience. Take a deep breath and slowly meditate on the reason you set out on the journey in the first place. And finally, adopt the twenty-four-hour rule to avoid becoming overly concerned with success or failure. This means spending 24 hours ruminating on the successes or failures that come your way, then getting back on the road to mastery. This gives you valuable perspective. After all, you’re guaranteed to encounter failure and external motivators like money on the road to mastery of your passion. But these shouldn’t stop you – they’re just bumps in the road. Harmonious passions are lifelong journeys, and your focus should be not on being the best but on continuing to improve. We’ve all heard the mantra over and over again – balance is a necessary part of living a happy life. Countless self-help books have preached this message for decades, proclaiming that it’s possible both to pursue your passion relentlessly and to spend an equal amount of time and energy on other important aspects of life, such as your family. But this is where a second passion paradox comes in – achieving your passion and living a balanced life are antithetical to each other. Even the harmoniously passionate individual must be completely consumed and singularly focused on achieving mastery. Living a passion-filled existence can indeed involve, as its original meaning implied, a certain amount of suffering and sacrificing time and energy that would be spent elsewhere. Take a moment to think whether a single extremely passionate, successful individual in history has lived a truly balanced life. Even towering figures like Mahatma Gandhi, who successfully led India toward independence from Britain, lived extremely unbalanced lives. While he preached non-violence and unity to the Indian people, he himself had a very troubled relationship with his son, whom he eventually disowned. So instead of seeking balance, harness the power of self-awareness to sustain your passion in the long term. Doing so involves regularly monitoring and managing how your passion affects others around you, as well as your own emotions and behavior. In other words, self-awareness means you regularly need to commit time outside of your passion to the endeavor of getting to know yourself better. Paradoxically, one of the best ways to be more self-aware is to step outside of yourself. For example, start writing a journal about your passion, how it’s developing and how it affects your life – and give yourself extra perspective by writing in the third person. You can then read back what you’ve written and reflect on how your actions look from the outside. Another way to practice self-awareness is to make sure you are regularly stepping outside of the narrow confines of your passion to gain a wider perspective on the world around you. This can be as simple as spending time in nature, listening to music or even ruminating over simple acts of kindness that you witness. By regularly practicing self-awareness, you’ll be much better equipped to make decisions about what you do in pursuit of your passion. Whether it happens voluntarily or not, giving up a passion that you’ve spent years cultivating can be a very distressing process. After all, for those who’ve practiced their passions according to the principles of the mastery mind-set, their passion inevitably defines who they are. You might have started out having an interest in writing, but by developing your passion, you became a writer. This transformation embodies a process through which our passion becomes an integral part of who we are and how we orient ourselves in the world. Having to give up a passion can even result in destructive behavior, a danger for people like aging athletes and artists who can no longer make ends meet. After all, passions transform our physical and psychological selves; we become accustomed to the dopamine that practicing our passion produces, and when we’re no longer receiving it, that leaves a void. This void can be a recipe for substance abuse, gambling or other sorts of regrettable activities. This can even be the point at which the fine line between passion and drug addiction that we’ve discussed finally gets crossed. Of course, there are a number of less destructive coping mechanisms upon which people who give up their passion can rely. Retired athletes, for example, go through “transition out of sport” classes. Recently retired professionals court advice from friends, who’ll often tell them they should fill the void with new activities that will help keep them stimulated, such as traveling or volunteering. But these coping strategies only have limited effectiveness as they come from other people telling us what to do. The only place you can truly discover ways of climbing out of the void left by giving up your passion is within yourself. So instead of surrounding yourself with friends or going on an adventure, you need to reflect on all the positive attributes in which years of pursuing your passion have resulted. By doing so, you’ll be able to craft a unique story about what you enjoyed most in the pursuit of your passion and why you will miss it. Once you feel you’ve reflected on your passion for long enough to encapsulate its importance to your identity, it’s time to get on with your life. Embrace the personality characteristics that fueled your passion in the first place and redirect them into new endeavors – and perhaps even new passions. The key message in these blinks: Passion is all about becoming entirely consumed by an activity that brings the most amount of satisfaction to your life. But beware the pitfalls of passion – it can lead to unhealthy obsessions and even being driven by fear. As long as your passion remains harmonious, it can develop in a healthy direction. Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean living a balanced life – passion inevitably requires sacrifice. But the joy and rewards of the mastery of passion can be worth it.  Actionable advice: If you’re feeling lost while developing your passion, take time to meditate. Sometimes, we can get so deep into our passion that we forget to take a moment to step back and gather our thoughts. This is where meditation comes in. When you’re feeling overwhelmed, overworked or even just stressed by anything relating to your passion, sit or lie down and clear your head. Focus on your breath and let your thoughts pass by without judging them. For those of us already deep in our pursuit of passion, regular meditation can be a great way to cope with stress. Even just 20 minutes a day will help equip you to deal with any challenges that you might meet along the way. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Were they born with special powers? Are they from another planet? The answer to both questions is no. Simply put, extreme athletes are simply better at entering the flowstate, i.e., “the zone” in which we achieve optimal performance and feel our best. In these blinks, you’ll learn all about the neurology of flow and its powerful ability to enhance performance and give us deeply profound spiritual experiences. You’ll also find out how a $2 bet led to one of the craziest, most extreme sports of all time. Furthermore, you’ll learn how to prime your mind with the right conditions to induce flow, as well as how a certain twelve-year-old was able to land tricks once thought to be far outside the realm of possibility. Have you ever been so “in the zone” that the entire world around you seemed to fade away? Did you notice that, during that time, you were performing at your very best? If so, you’re not alone. This experience, called flow, is fundamental part of the human experience. But what is it exactly? Flow is a mental state that allows us to perform at our absolute best. One way it does so is by acutely increasing in our ability to find creative solutions to problems. For example, when the surfer Laird Hamilton rode the “Millenium Wave” off the coast of Tahiti, he likely would have died had he not followed to his creative insight that he gained from flow. As the enormous wave began to break near the reef-ridden coast, he put his hands on the opposite side of the board into the water in order to prevent getting sucked up into the hydraulic. This is spectacular because it had never been done before, and is the only thing that saved him from death. In addition, people often find flow to be a powerfully spiritual experience. After being in the flow state, many people report having heard the Voice, i.e., their subconscious creative intuition. For example, when famous climber Dean Potter recounts climbing the gigantic Fitz Roy mountain, he attributes his success to the Voice. Upon reaching a wall of ice three times the size of New York’s Chrysler building, he made approximately 670 correct moves up the wall with no equipment. Not being able to judge a path from the bottom of the wall, just one wrong move would have meant death, but the Voice did not deceive him. In addition, people who are in a flow state often experience egoloss, i.e., the sense that they don’t exist as individuals. They become their sport. For example, surfers often report the feeling of being “one with the waves” after experiencing flow. Flow is often experienced as something deeply spiritual, and these experiences themselves are tied to our neurochemistry. When we enter flow states, our brains release the following five crucial chemicals that both make us feel good and actually augment our performance. The first is dopamine, which helps us to sharpen our focus and find novel solutions to problems. Our brains are constantly bombarded with a myriad of signals, and dopamine helps adjust signal-to-noise ratios, i.e., filter useful information from everything else. Dopamine is also responsible for our feelings of engagement, excitement and desire for exploration, and in fact even rewards exploratory behavior by making us feel good. Next is norepinephrine, which helps us to maintain focus and boosts our skills. Norepinephrine increases blood sugar, thus giving us more energy in our bodies. It also speeds up our heart rate and respiration, ensuring that our muscles don’t wear out. In our brains, it increases emotional control, arousal and attention. In essence, it helps keep us focused on the task at hand. This is combined with a healthy dose of anandamide, which boosts our creativity. Anandamide increases lateral thought, i.e., our brains’ ability to develop novel connections. Furthermore, it reduces our ability to feel fear, thus making us more prone to test out these novel ideas. In addition, endorphins offer us relief from muscle pain. This is especially useful for extreme athletes, who push their bodies to the absolute limits. Endorphins are also incredibly powerful: the most commonly produced endorphin is more powerful than medical morphine by a factor of one hundred. Finally, the flow state is followed by a healthy squirt of serotonin. Serotonin is responsible for the “afterglow” we feel after being in the zone, and a big part of what keeps us coming back for more! All these chemicals contribute to the deeply profound experience of peak performance, both in terms of our physical abilities as well as the amazing feeling itself. Common wisdom tells us that our brains must be in overdrive during peak performance. If we are better problem solvers when we are experiencing flow, then the parts of our brains responsible for complex thought must be working especially hard, right? In fact, parts of our brain actually turn off during flow. When in flow, our brains undergo a process called transient hypofrontality, during which parts of our prefrontal cortex (the part of our brain responsible for complex thought) shut down. Scientists have discovered that when you’re immersed in any task – from playing cards to mountain climbing – your superior frontal gyrus, which is responsible for self-awareness and introspection, begins to shut down. In addition, our orientation adjustment area, the part of the brain which helps us orient ourselves in relation to other objects in our environment, begins to slow down. This is what’s responsible for the feeling of “oneness” that people often experience when they are in intense flow states, e.g., being one with the waves while surfing or one with the universe during meditation. So how does all this translate into increased performance? It turns out that this decrease in self-awareness makes us less likely to doubt our intuitions and more likely to act out novel ideas. Of course, this isn’t always helpful. If you’re trying to survive in the wilderness, then extreme prudence is essential: having a clear sense of self prevents you from trying out novel ideas and thus might prevent you from getting killed doing something stupid. In the world of extreme sports, however, where you have to make split-second decisions to save yourself from a grizzly death, you simply don’t have any time to second-guess your decisions. Being uninhibited by these parts of the brain is therefore a great advantage when success depends on creative solutions. Once we’ve had a taste of the profound increase in performance awarded by flow, we’ll want to know how to recreate the experience. To enter flow, you must ensure that the following these specific conditions are met: First, your task should be intrinsically rewarding; the activity itself should be its own reward. For example, if you want to run a marathon, then you should enjoy running. You probably feel a sense of accomplishment even after finishing a long run. This enjoyment is the foundation upon which the other criteria are built; without it, entering flow is much more difficult. In addition, you need to attain a high level of concentration and absorption in your task. The best way to cultivate this concentration is to remain focused on the present moment. For example, if you’re on a run training for a marathon, that might mean focusing on your breathing to avoid being disrupted by other thoughts. Furthermore, your task should be challenging, but not impossible. In fact, without the right level of difficulty, then it’s impossible to enter the state of concentration necessary to achieve flow. But exactly how difficult should your task be? It should be roughly 4 percent greater than your skill level. For example, if you’re a runner, that might meaning running 4 percent further or 4 percent faster than normal. Once you enter flow, you’ll want to stay there. In order to do this, you need clearly defined goals to maintain your concentration. These goals should be immediately attainable and not the same as your life goals. For example, while your ultimate goal might be to run a marathon, you need immediate goals to maintain flow. Whether you’re practicing or running your marathon, your goal could be something as simple as keeping track of the number of road signs you pass, with each one being a new goal reached!  Why do you think top performers are able to achieve greatness? Did their natural talent boost them to the top? Or was it hard work and dedication? It turns out the way you answer these questions can determine whether you can perform at the highest level. In fact, believing that talent is something we are born with and cannot change will ultimately limit your ability to improve. This belief about skills and talent is called the fixed mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe that skill and talent are innate, and that we can only work with a limited, pre-determined skill level. When these people see great performers, like solo rock climbers or free divers, they don’t think, “What do I need to do to accomplish that?” Instead, they think, “I wish I had their talent.” People who adopt this kind of thinking place unnecessary limits on their progress: it’s much harder for people with fixed mindsets to set goals or push themselves, since they see growth as futile. Essentially, if you believe you can’t improve, you’re likely to see little improvement. However, if you adopt a growth mindset, i.e., if you believe that skills and talent are the result of hard work and determination, then it’s actually possible to reach your true potential. Indeed, people with growth mindsets are much more open to the possibility of improvement, and this in turn helps them to set appropriate goals and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. For example, scientists conducted an experiment with the forty best racecar drivers, surveying each driver about their mindset before, during and after each race of the season. Those with growth mindsets had an easier time entering flow states, regardless of whether they had misfortunes in the race. Furthermore, those with growth mindsets all turned out to be the best performers of even the top forty racers! Knowing the ingredients of flow and having the right mindset are important, but the best way to help you achieve peak performance is to seek a community that has dedicated themselves to your shared interest. Luckily, our neurology makes this easy. In fact, the release of chemicals caused by flow not only enhances performance, but also help create strong social bonds. For example, if you’re a mountaineer and go up an intense and treacherous path with a group that you otherwise would have nothing to do with, you can’t help but feel a social bond with them. That’s because our neurochemicals are much less prejudiced than we are: they don’t care about our peers’ social background or political beliefs. Furthermore, being part of a group of people who share your interest can help improve your performance. For example, when we do something extraordinary without anyone to bear witness, we sometimes write off these feats as “flukes.” However, a community that shares your passion is unlikely to belittle your accomplishments, which helps you build confidence and continue to grow. Not only that: they also validate your accomplishments with genuine admiration, which further boosts your confidence. Communities also help us push the limits of what’s possible. For example, back when bungee jumping was still quite young, members of a house called “Primal House” had a running bet to see who could best whom with their bungee tricks. Their prize? A $2 bill they kept tacked to the wall. This ongoing bet led them from bungee jumping to BASE jumping, and eventually led to one of the most extreme sports ever: double ski BASE jumping. In other words, BASE jumping, landing and skiing down a mountain slope, only to jump off the mountain and BASE jump again, all in a single movement. If someone asked you how to build muscle mass, how would you answer? You’d probably refer to diet and exercise; at the very least, someone would have to exert their body in someway in order to achieve results, right? Well, not exactly... To answer this question, let’s turn our attention from the body to the mind: the mind is an immensely powerful tool we’re only beginning to understand. In fact, the mind alone is able to achieve things that we often believe can only be accomplished with the body. For example, in an experiment measuring how visualization exercises affect physical strength, participants were divided into three groups: those who did nothing, those who tried to increase strength through physical exercise, and those who tried to increase strength by visualizing themselves performing the exercises. While physical exercise showed the most marked improvement, those who did only visualization exercises also saw an up to 35% increase in strength! In addition, the development of novel technologies gives us a better picture of how exactly our neurology affects our performance. Such technological developments, such as fMRI and EEG, which measure blood flow and electrical activity in the brain respectively, have allowed us to build a more precise picture of how our brain state, i.e., our brain’s chemical configuration, changes when we enter flow. Because of these technologies, we no longer have to rely on anecdotal evidence to piece together the “how” and “why” of flow. And, thankfully, these technologies are becoming more widely available and easy to use. One example of this is the portable, EEG-based unit called BrainSport, that is small enough as to not require athletes to come into a lab to get readings. These kinds of developments create a larger pool of information to study flow, which in turn will help us to sharpen our understanding of how to use it. With each passing year, humanity reaches a new milestone of what we thought was possible. And the more milestones we reach, the more it seems that the sky’s the limit. Indeed, whenever a groundbreaking innovation is achieved, we learn something new about what’s possible. We call this the Roger Bannister Effect. For a long time, people didn’t think it possible to run an under-four-minute mile. Runners kept getting close, but no one could break that threshold until 1954 with Roger Bannister clocking in at 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds. His record was broken within a mere two months, and then twice more within five years. Ten years later, a high school student ran a four-minute mile for the first time. So what changed? Bannister broke down the psychological barrier surrounding the four-minute mile – because what we perceive to be possible changes with every new achievement. Adding to this, younger generations have greater access to our growing wealth of knowledge about peak performance, and are thus able to achieve even greater things. For example, at 31 years old, Tony Hawk did the impossible by landing the first ever 900 trick (2.5 turns in the air) at the 1999 X Games. In 2012, Tom Schaar became the first person ever to land a 1080 (three complete turns in the air) at the age of twelve. What did Schaar have that Hawk didn’t? He benefited from a long line of positive role models in skating; he was able to not only see what was possible, but beyond what was possible, and trust himself to be able to achieve it. In short: he had a mindset for flow. Every new generation will have access to a greater wealth of knowledge on flow and peak performance than the one before it. While we can’t be certain what great feats they will accomplish, we can at least know this: it will be amazing. The key message in this book: Flow is a state of mind in which we operate at our absolute best. But it is not mystical: flow is rooted in our neurochemistry and can be harnessed with enough know-how. The more we learn about flow, the greater and more spectacular the feats that mankind will accomplish. Actionable advice: Set clear, immediate goals. One of the most important criteria for getting into the zone is a set of goals that are immediately achievable. If you’re an author, for example, then your goal should be something like “write two awesome paragraphs,” not “write a best-selling novel.” These goals help to keep you focused on and immersed in the task at hand, as well as offer you immediate feedback, which you can use to hone your skills.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Obviously, hard work and dedication are essential. But it also helps immensely if you happen to be blessed with excellent genes, as they can give you a body type well suited for certain sports. One of the most often mentioned and obvious physical traits that is genetically determined is height. In the industrialized world, it’s estimated that approximately 80% of the difference in people’s heights is due to their genes. But there’s no single gene that determines height. As yet, even the best study on the topic managed to explain only 45% of the height differences among people, and even that required surveying hundreds of thousands of genetic differences. What’s more, genetic influence on other physical traits is similarly ambiguous. What is certain, however, is that tall people are clearly advantaged when it comes to basketball. Because the basket is ten feet off the ground, the higher one’s reach, the greater his advantage. Indeed, at a professional level, this advantage is such that, right now, an incredible 17% of American men aged 20-40 over seven feet tall are in the NBA. Height is so important in the NBA that shorter-than-average players usually need other attributes to compensate for their short stature. For example, they may have long, stiff achilles’ tendons that allow them to jump high – like Spud Webb, who at just 5’7” still managed to win the 1986 Slam Dunk Contest. Shorter players usually also have a disproportionately long arm span, which gives them a higher reach, enabling them to for example better block shots and get rebounds. In fact, the average arm span of a NBA player is so wide compared to his height that this disproportion would normally lead to a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, a disorder which affects the body’s connective tissue. And just like height, the skeletal structure that produces a wide arm span is also largely hereditary. As with basketball, having the right skeletal structure can be of great benefit in many other sports, too. Of course, how we define “right” is determined by the sport under consideration. Long-distance runners, for instance, benefit from a so-called “Nilotic” body – a very slim torso and thin legs – as evident in today’s best marathon runners. This body type is beneficial because long legs allow for a longer stride and faster top-speed, while the lightness of a thin torso reduces the load on the legs. The bodies of long-distance runners also tend to be small because it gives them a larger skin surface area in relation to the body’s volume. This allows them to disperse heat more effectively; a crucial advantage in a long, potentially exhausting race. In contrast, sprinters require shorter legs because short legs have less inertia, enabling these runners to accelerate quickly from a standing start. In fact, the shorter the distance of a race, the shorter that successful runners’ legs tend to be. This phenomenon is also seen in American football, where quick acceleration is crucial. Indeed, even while humans have gotten taller over the last four decades, the average height of running backs and cornerbacks in the NFL has declined. Short legs are also a trait of successful swimmers, along with long arms and upper bodies – a skeletal structure that helps them to glide along the water. For example, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps is 6’4” yet he wears pants with a relatively short 32-inch inseam. Furthermore, the suitability of one’s body type to certain sports can be greatly influenced by ancestry. One study found that, in general, black adults (African ancestry) have longer legs and a higher center of mass than white adults (European ancestry), which would suggest that the body type of black adults is better suited to running, while white adults’ lower center of mass makes them better swimmers – a theory that’s been confirmed by statistical studies. We now know that inherited skeletal structure is clearly advantageous to playing certain sports – but equally important is muscular structure. Muscles are made up of two types of fiber: fast-twitch and slow-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers contract quickly, enabling fast, explosive movements, but they tend to tire rapidly. For that reason, these fibers are well-suited for sprinting or weight lifting. In contrast, slow-twitch fibers have a slower response time. Yet they also have more stamina, making them useful in endurance sports. We each have a different ratio of these muscle fibers, inclining us to do better at certain sports than others, and there’s very strong evidence that this ratio is inherited. While in most people the ratio of fast to slow-twitch fibers is about 50/50, the ratio in athletes who excel at a particular sport can be quite different. For example, one top long-distance runner was found to have 80% slow-twitch fibers, and the calf muscles of sprinters are, in general, made up of 75% fast-twitch fibers. In addition, the ratio also determines how muscles respond to weight training, because fast-twitch fibers are able to grow at double the rate of slow-twitch ones. For example, in one study, some participants who followed a four-month weight-training program managed a 50% increase in muscle size while others following the same program saw no increase at all. As well as determining the growth rate of muscles, our genes also determine the maximum size they can attain. According to some studies, five kilos of muscle requires one kilo of bone for support, which means that people with a small skeletal structure will find it difficult to gain the muscle mass required for power sports. Furthermore, there are even genetic abnormalities which cause an unusual condition known as “double muscle,” as was seen recently when the German media dubbed one infant “the superbaby,” born with large biceps and well-defined calves. This genetic condition was shown to be identical with that which causes the unusually bulging muscles of Belgian Blue cows. When we do any kind of sports, we quickly start panting. This is because our muscles demand oxygen to function. Unsurprisingly, the amount of oxygen that an athlete can take in will greatly influence his or her performance. This so-called aerobic capacity, or VO2max, is defined as the maximum rate of oxygen intake over a period of increasingly strenuous exercise –  for example on a treadmill. The rate of intake is determined to a great extent by one’s innate “baseline” capacity. For example, it turns out about 0.3% of all people happen to be naturally fit: they have the VO2max of an athlete, despite being completely untrained. So, what physiological factors determine our maximum aerobic capacity? One factor is the total volume of blood in our bodies: the more blood we have flowing through our veins, the more oxygen it can carry. Another factor is the ability of our blood to carry this oxygen, which is determined by the amount of hemoglobin – an oxygen-carrying protein – in our red blood cells, and the number of those red blood cells in our blood. Both are largely determined by one’s baseline VO2max. For example, one professional cross-country skier was found to naturally have 65% more red blood cells than the average male. Yet, studies have also found that it’s possible to increase VO2max through training. In particular, training at a high altitude is an effective way to increase VO2max because the body responds to the lower amount of oxygen in the air by producing more red blood cells and hemoglobin. In fact, some athletes take advantage of this phenomenon by spending time training at high altitudes before competitions. The ideal altitude is six- to seven-thousand feet; any higher and the increase of red blood cells and hemoglobin begins to slow down the blood flow. And those born at a high altitude are at an even greater advantage, as they naturally develop larger lungs growing up, so are able to take in more oxygen. In addition to its influence on muscles, skeletal structure and aerobic capacity, our genetic makeup also affects athletic performance in more subtle ways. For instance, did you know that our genes influence our motivation and desire to train? As studies have indicated, one’s genes greatly determine how much he or she exercises: up to 75% of the variation in the amount of exercise people do is due to their genetic makeup. This has a neurological basis, as the brains of some people don’t sense pleasure as readily as others, which means those people have to train harder to feel gratified. Consider triathlete Pam Reed, for example, who is compelled to run up to five times per day because otherwise she would begin to feel sick. Having such a strong urge to train clearly gives her a great advantage over other athletes. Another way that genetic makeup influences how much or how hard you can train is in its effect on pain threshold. When pushing the performance of your body to its limits, pain is always a factor. How sensitive you are to it will affect whether you give up when the pain seems unbearable or keep pushing. Those who are genetically more resilient to pain are more likely to continue training – a predisposition that gives them a massive advantage. Finally, your genes can also hinder training by making you more or less susceptible to injury. Indeed, studies show that genetic differences can account for how easily one’s bones break or their tissues tear, and even how well their brain recovers from damage. This predisposition towards injury can have a critical effect on athletic success, because such injury can hinder training and, even worse, end careers. If you follow athletics, it’s hard not to notice that a disproportionate number of the world’s most successful long-distance runners hail from Kenya and Ethiopia. What explains this dominance? First, Kenya and Ethiopia are located on the equator, where the extreme heat has resulted in the local populace having small, “nilotic” bodies to disperse body heat effectively – a body type ideal for long-distance running. Second, both countries have an altitude that’s close to the “sweet spot” for altitude training. As a result, the inhabitants have evolved to have larger than average lungs, as well as higher hemoglobin and red blood cell counts. Moreover, the best long-distance runners originate from even more specific groups within those countries – the Kalenjin tribe in Kenya, and Oromo tribe in Ethiopia. Despite the fact that both are minority groups, the tribes produce a majority of the countries’ top runners. One reason for this is that members of these tribes have thin lower legs which use less energy and thus provide the runners with more stamina in long-distance races. In fact, scientists have calculated the amount of energy a Kalenjin runner saves, in comparison to a Danish runner, to be eight percent per kilometer. This difference can be explained, in part, by evolution. Both tribes originate from a pastoralist background, where their ancestors often raided cattle from other tribes. To pull this off, they had to run long distances; the best runners seized the most cattle, resulting in them having more wives and producing more children with their genes. Finally, inhabitants of both countries run more on a daily basis than those of other countries, and they’re highly motivated to succeed at becoming top runners. For example, the children of these countries tend to run wherever they go, and thus develop a high aerobic capacity from a young age. And for the people of both countries, becoming a good runner can mean escaping a life of poverty – a strong motivation to train hard. As astounding as the dominance of East African nations in long-distance running is the extraordinary success of sprinters with West African heritage. For the past few decades, every Olympic finalist in the men’s one-hundred meters has his ancestral roots in West Africa. So, what’s behind this incredible track record? Quite simply, evolution has left West Africans with bodies capable of explosive bursts of energy. The roots of this power can be traced to the pervasiveness of malaria in West Africa. To cope with malaria, the inhabitants evolved certain traits that made their red blood cells more resilient to the disease, but, at the same time, those traits also decreased the oxygen in the blood. To compensate for this, the West Africans also evolved to have a higher ratio of fast- to slow-twitch muscle fibers, in addition to a more oxygen-efficient energy metabolizing process. While both traits preserved oxygen, they were also beneficial for the production of explosive force required in short-distance running. Another source of world-class sprinters is Jamaica – specifically, the tiny parish of Trelawny. While many of the world’s top sprinters originate from Jamaica, a disproportionately large number of them can trace their roots to Trelawny – for example, the 2008 Olympic-winning sprinters Usain Bolt and Veronica Campbell-Brown. What’s so special about this Trelawny population as it’s known? According to one speculative theory, the physical fitness of its people is due to Trelawny’s history of slavery. Slave traders took slaves from West Africa (those with already strong “sprinter” genes) on an horrifically arduous voyage to Jamaica that only the very strongest could survive. Once these survivors reached Jamaica, some slaves managed to escape to secluded Trelawny, where they could not be found. Naturally, only the fastest runners were able to make this daring escape. This would mean only the fittest and fastest of the slaves found their way to Trelawny, ultimately passing on their genes to the elite sprinters of today. The key message in this book: Although hard work and training are certainly crucial in any sport, one’s athletic abilities are also massively influenced by ancestry. From your skeleton to your muscles and even to your motivation, your genes play a large role in determining your athletic fate. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the divide between the specific abilities of runners with ancestry in East or West Africa. Actionable advice: To find your sport, take at look at yourself and your family. Try to get a grasp of what kind of natural physiology you have, by examining yourself, your parents and your siblings. What kind of sports have you or they excelled at? Are they particularly strong or tall? Do they have stamina or rather excel at explosive force?  Also, think about where your roots are and where you were born? What kind of people thrived in the environment of your ancestors, and how would the place you grew up in have influenced for instance your aerobic capacity? Once you have an idea of your natural physiology, you will understand your natural strengths better, and can find a training regimen that makes the most of those strengths.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Whether we want to choose a career, a partner or the best news source, we have a multitude of options available to us. So why isn’t it pure bliss to be alive? Why are so many of us stressed out and unfulfilled? After all, we should have everything we want! Well, it’s because we’re trying to do it all. We have so many options open to us that we end up concentrating on all our different choices and opportunities, all the time. In short, we’re spreading ourselves too thin and burning ourselves out. So what can we do instead? As these blinks show, we need to find out what is important to us, and concentrate on doing that. Everything else? We shouldn’t give a fuck about it! These blinks will help you discover which few things are important enough to you to give a fuck about. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why you shouldn’t compare yourself to Metallica; that self-criticism is the key to being right; and why death should be the end for all of us. What do you really want out of life? In other words, what’s your ultimate goal – the achievement you want written on your headstone? It’s not such an easy question to answer, is it? Sure, many of us will claim that we want happiness, a loving family and a job we enjoy, but these are pretty vague ambitions. And vague ambitions are problematic because they won’t push you to strive for success. Unfortunately, if you want to get anywhere in life, you’ll have to struggle. Achieving your goals will require hard work and plenty of perseverance; it’s guaranteed that there will be setbacks and hardships on the way. If you don’t have a goal you’re determined to achieve, you’ll falter in the face of this adversity. Let’s say becoming a CEO is your goal. After all, being a CEO certainly sounds cool: just think of all that power and responsibility. And yet, being a CEO is far from a walk in the park. CEOs regularly put in 60-hour workweeks, they have to make tough decisions and they need to be ready to fire people, time and time again. If you aren’t hell-bent on becoming a CEO, you’ll struggle with the hard work, and your chances of being a success will be slim. Since struggle is unavoidable, you have to find something worth struggling for. You have to identify what you really enjoy doing. Working on something that makes you happy means you’ll not only be undeterred by the constant battle; you’ll grow to love it. Take the author. He realized that he really enjoyed writing about dating, and so he decided to focus on writing a dating-advice blog. It was a challenge at first, but because he loved what he did, he thrived on the adversity. Eventually, the struggle paid off; the blog garnered hundreds of thousands of subscribers and it paid more than enough for the author to make it his full-time job. There is no point looking for an easy life, one without adversity. The only way you’ll get ahead is to find a goal that you want to struggle for. However, it’s equally important to say no to all the struggles and tasks that don’t bring you joy. Be ruthless and stop chasing the things in life that don’t make you happy. Concentrate on the few great things – and don’t give a fuck about everything else. The best examples of success through struggle can be found in the art world. After all, we tend to imagine the quintessential artist as poverty-stricken and underappreciated – someone who refuses to give in until her genius is recognized. And this stereotype is actually more accurate than you’d imagine. Consider the guitarist Dave Mustaine. In 1983, Mustaine was thrown out of his band when they were right on the cusp of fame. Seething with anger at the rejection, Mustaine became determined to show his former bandmates just how wrong they’d been. For two years he worked relentlessly to improve his skills and find the musicians to make an even better band. The band he went on to form was Megadeth, a hugely popular band that went on to sell over 25 million records. However, despite the success of Megadeth, Mustaine still wasn’t happy. He continued to judge his success against the achievements of his former band. Unfortunately for him, this band was Metallica, one of the world’s biggest music acts. Because he compared himself to Metallica, Mustaine considered himself a failure, in spite of his obvious successes. Mustaine’s persistent unhappiness highlights a common danger: measuring one’s success against the success of others. For Mustaine, the only way to feel successful was to be more successful than his former bandmates, which meant he was doomed to disappointment. It goes without saying that you need to find healthier values to judge your achievements by. Pete Best is a brilliant example of how the right values can lead to happiness. Like Dave Mustaine, Best was kicked out of a band on the brink of stardom. Alas, for Best, this group happened to be The Beatles, the biggest band of all time. Watching his former bandmates reach the top, Best fell into a deep depression. But then he switched his values. He realized that what he really wanted in life was a loving family and a happy home life. Sure, he still wanted to play music, but he didn’t want musical success, or the lack of it, to define his life. This refocusing led to a happy, fulfilled life, and Best even went back to enjoying making music again – this time for less successful bands. So our values are more important than success when it comes to happiness. In the next blink, we’ll look at how to find the right values to live by. In the previous blink, we saw that measuring your worth by comparing yourself to others will only lead to disappointment. And this is just one of many shitty values that can derail you on your path to happiness. Consider pleasure, for instance. Many people choose to make pleasure their priority in life. And yet chasing pleasure above everything else isn’t healthy; in fact, it’s the central value of drug addicts, adulterers and gluttons. Research has shown that those who regard pleasure as the greatest good are likely to be anxious and depressed. Another shitty value is using your material success as the yardstick for your life. Whether it be hankering after a bigger car than your neighbor's or flashing your brand new Rolex, this value is incredibly common, and you’ve probably bought into it at some point. But it doesn't lead to improved well-being. Studies have shown that once our basic needs in life are cared for, extra wealth doesn’t increase happiness. And chasing wealth can even have a detrimental effect if we chose to pursue it over values like family, honesty or integrity. So how can you avoid shitty values? Well, adherence to shitty values most often derives from a lack of worthwhile values. So, if you want to be neither blindly hedonistic nor covetous of your neighbor's new Mercedes, you need to identify values worth living by.   These good values should: Be based in reality Be helpful to society Have an immediate and controllable effect Take honesty. Honesty is a great value to live by because you can control it (only you can decide to be truthful or not); it's based in reality; and, because it provides truthful feedback to others, it's helpful. Some other values that fulfill these three criteria are creativity, generosity and humility. Every year, thousands of amateur runners take part in marathons. Many of them do so to raise money for good causes. Even though a great many struggle to finish, most marathon runners are proud of their achievement. Now imagine that, instead of volunteering to run a marathon, you were forced to take part. No matter how well you actually ran, chances are you’d detest the whole experience. Feeling compelled to do something robs it of its joy. Sadly, many of us go through life as if our experiences were imposed upon us. Whether it be a failed job interview, a rejection from a loved one or even a missed bus, we see ourselves as the unhappy victims of life circumstances. Let’s look at an extreme example of this phenomenon. William James was born to a wealthy, privileged family in nineteenth-century America. Suffering from ill-health, he would often experience bouts of vomiting and back spasms. His early dream was to become a painter, but he struggled to make his mark, and his father constantly mocked his lack of talent. So he decided to pursue a career in medicine – and then dropped out of medical school. Unwell and unhappy, with neither family support nor a job, James considered suicide. But then, he read about the work of the philosopher Charles Pierce. Pierce’s central argument was that everyone should take 100 percent responsibility for their own life, a message that struck a chord with James. James realized that his misery stemmed from his belief that he was a victim of outside influences. Whether it was his sickness or his father’s criticisms, he blamed his situation on things he couldn’t control, and this made him feel powerless. He realized that he was responsible for his life and his actions, and, empowered with this thought, he started afresh. After years of hard work, James went on to become a pioneer in American psychology. So, if you ever feel like a victim, remember William James and try taking responsibility for your own life. Imagine you get dumped by your partner. It would be all too easy to blame your former beloved for being cruel and uncaring, but it’d be wiser to look at how you were responsible for the relationship’s failure. Perhaps you neglected your fair share of housework, or maybe you didn’t support your partner’s ambitions. By realizing and working on your mistakes, you can avoid them in the future. Only then can you live a better, happier life. Picture this: You’re a senior manager at a large, illustrious company. You like your job and the compensation; you have a nice car, sharp clothes and the respect of your colleagues. Most of all, you love being a senior manager. Being a senior manager is who you are. Now, imagine that you have the chance to get right to the top. However, the opportunity isn’t without substantial risks. If you fail to pull it off perfectly, you’ll lose everything  – the job, the car, the respect and, most importantly, your identity. Would you take the chance? The vast majority of people wouldn’t risk it. This is a result of what the author calls Manson’s Law of Avoidance – the tendency to flee anything that threatens our identity. Although avoiding major risks – such as that described above – may seem wise, our desperation to protect our identity is often more of a hindrance than a help. For example, many amateur artists and writers refuse to publicize or sell their work. They’re terrified that, should they show their art or writing, no one would like it. Trying and failing would destroy their identity, an identity that’s been built around the possibility of becoming a great artist. So they never try at all. Luckily, there is a way to temper the negatives of Manson’s Law of Avoidance: practicing Buddhism. Buddhism teaches that identity is an illusion. Whatever labels you give yourself – rich, poor, happy, sad, successful, a failure – are merely mental constructs. They simply aren’t real and so we shouldn’t let them dictate our lives. You must, therefore, learn to let go of your identity. Liberating yourself from an identity can be a wonderful experience. For example, you may have always considered yourself to be a career-minded person, and this has meant that you’ve always put your job first, and your family and hobbies second. Free yourself of this constraining self-image, and you’ll be able to do whatever makes you happy, whether that be spending time with your kids or making model airplanes. Don’t you just hate those annoying people who always think they’re right? Those smug know-it-alls who, even when you tell them they’re in the wrong, simply won’t listen? Thank heavens you’re not like that yourself! Well, unfortunately, you are. From time to time, we all suffer from the delusion that we’re correct when we’re not. Take this example: one of the author’s friends had recently gotten engaged. The groom-to-be was almost universally seen as a decent, friendly person. Except by the friend’s fiancée’s brother. He simply wouldn’t stop criticizing his sister’s choice of partner and was convinced that her fiancé would end up hurting her. Most people knew the brother was wrong, including his own sister. But, try as they might, they couldn’t get him to entertain the possibility that he might be acting a little delusional. If you want to avoid acting like this brother, you’ve got to be willing to ask yourself whether you’re wrong, time and time again. Only by doing this can you overcome those blind spots where you wrongly think you’re right. This isn’t as easy as it sounds; quite often, our false beliefs cover up our insecurities. This means that, by constantly questioning our decisions and actions, we’ll uncover uncomfortable truths about ourselves. Back to the example of the hypercritical brother: it’s likely that his dislike of the groom-to-be was hiding his own insecurities. Maybe he was envious that his sister had found love and he hadn’t. Perhaps he was jealous because his sister was devoting her attention to her fiancé, not to him. He might even have been angry because his sister paid little attention to what he wanted. Whatever the reason, it was easier for him to blindly make fallacious assumptions than to deal with his own insecurities. Luckily, you don’t have to fall into the same trap. By being ready to question your beliefs and face your insecurities, you can behave in a healthier, happier way. Romeo and Juliet is perhaps the most famous love story in the world. And yet it’s hardly a happy one; it’s a rather chaotic story, involving murder, exile and blood feuds and it ends with both lovers committing suicide. The tragic tale of those star-crossed lovers highlights the destructive power of romantic love. Studies have shown that passionate, romantic relationships have a stimulating effect on the brain similar to that of cocaine. That is, you experience an intense high and then you crash back down. Then, you search again for the high, though not necessarily with the same person – a recipe for pain and anguish. Back in Shakespeare’s time, the dangers of romantic love were well known. The Bard may have even written Romeo and Juliet as a critique of romantic desire as a destructive passion. Right up to the nineteenth century, most relationships and marriages were based on the respective skill sets of both partners rather than their passionate love for each other. Of course, things are different now. Today, romantic love is often held up to be the ideal, and this can lead to heartbreak. So what can you do? Should you give up on the idea of romance altogether? Not quite. Romantic love can be either unhealthy or healthy depending on whether it fulfills specific criteria. Unhealthy love happens when each partner uses the relationship to run away from their problems. For example, they might be unhappy with their lives, and so they use their feelings for each other as a distraction. Unfortunately, no one can mask personal problems forever, and so this avoidance-as-passion inevitably turns sour. Healthy love, on the other hand, exists when both partners are wholly invested in the relationship. Rather than using it as a distraction, they are devoted to each other. Rather than concentrate on their own feelings, each partner offers support to their significant other. However, this support has to be desired. If a partner oversteps boundaries, and seeks to control the other by, for example, looking to solve all their problems for them, problems will ensue. If one partner seeks to dominate the other, this is clear evidence of unhealthy love. You might not like to think about it, but you’re going to die one day. This uncomfortable fact, and how we deal with it, has an awful lot to do with how we live our lives. To fully understand just how much control death has over our lives, we can look to the work of Ernest Becker. Becker was a doctor of anthropology and a bit of a maverick. Although his unconventional approach and early death limited his academic career, he did write an influential book about dying, The Denial of Death. In this book, Becker presented two main ideas. The first is that humans are terrified of dying. Unlike other animals, humans are capable of thinking about hypothetical situations. We can imagine what our lives might be like if we had chosen to study a different subject in college, or, say, decided to be a pharmacist rather than a teacher. This ability to hypothesize has a downside, however. We can imagine what life would be like after we’ve ceased to be. This brings us to Becker’s second main idea – that, since we know we’re doomed to die, we try to create a conceptual self that will live on after our demise. In other words, we spend our mortal lives seeking out immortality projects, things that will endure as our legacy. It’s this desire that encourages some people to chase fame, while others may seek to make a mark in religion, politics or business. Yet this dream of immortality causes problems for society. People’s wish to fashion the world, or at least a part of it, as they see fit has caused war, destruction and misery. What’s more, it’s not healthy for us as individuals. The desperate urge to make a mark causes us stress and anxiety. Luckily, there is a straightforward solution. We have to stop striving for immortality. We need to stop “giving a fuck” about fame and power, and instead concentrate on the here and now. Look for meaning in the present and seek to spread happiness and joy where you are.   And not giving a fuck shouldn’t just be limited to thoughts of death. As you’ve learned in these blinks, trying to be all things to everyone just leads to pain. If you want to pursue a happy life, focus on the things you enjoy, be it the joyful struggle or a healthy relationship. Everything else is a pointless distraction. The key message in this book: We try to do too much in life and this leads to stress and unhappiness. Each of us needs to learn to stop “giving a fuck” about the things that are causing us pain. Choose what it is you really want to care about, and develop a more constructive approach to work, love and life itself.  Actionable advice: Forget FOMO and learn to say no. If you want to focus only on the things that really matter to you, it is vitally important to say “no!” to everything else. FOMO – the fear of missing out – keeps us stressed, but the truth is, we’ll miss out on things no matter what. You can’t have the perfect career, lots of family time and countless hours to spend surfing waves on a sunny beach. It’s more important to miss out on the right things. So pick what’s important to you, and ignore the rest. Be totally ruthless with this. For example, follow the path set by CEO multimillionaire Mohamed El-Erian, who resigned from his lucrative job so that he could spend more time with his young daughter. Got feedback?

What to read next: Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday You’ve just learned that being truly happy depends on a few important things in your life and learning to not give a f*ck about everything else. But this is only half the story. Now it’s time to turn inward. In Ego is the Enemy, American author and entrepreneur Ryan Holiday shows that there’s something else you should learn not to give a f*ck about; your ego. By using historical examples of inflated egos – like the tyrannical automobile engineer John DeLorean and basketball sensation Shaquille O’Neal – Holiday shows how, if left unchecked, your ego will get you into trouble. So if you want to learn how to curb your ego and live a happier, more successful life, we recommend the blinks to Ego is the Enemy.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

But wouldn’t it be great if we could program ourselves in a similar way? It turns out we can. Neuro-Linguistic programming, or NLP, is a way to change how we act and behave. It’s based on the connection between the neurological processes in your brain (neuro), the language you use (linguistic) and your behavior, such as your fears or beliefs (programming). Each of these parts can be altered, ultimately changing the way you act, feel and think. So, let’s look at how these processes work and what techniques you can use to program yourself. In these blinks, you’ll discover how emotions resemble yogurt; what the meta model is; and how your breathing can help you connect with other people. What causes humans to disagree with each other? The answer is simple: we see the world in different ways. Everyone creates a map in their mind that they use to make sense of the world. This concept is central to the idea of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, or NLP: a person’s understanding of the world is based on their internal map, not the actual world around them. Your personal map is a composite of your ideas, values, knowledge and preconceptions. When you create your map, you employ three basic processes. First, you delete some of the information around you. Just think of a city map: it doesn’t have cars or trees on it. Your personal map is also missing certain things, but they can be much bigger. Have you ever walked down a familiar street and noticed a shop for the first time? That’s because your map didn’t include the shop before you noticed it. Second, you generalize. Physical maps generalize too: roads are all drawn the same way and water is always the same shade of blue. Making these generalizations on your personal map can get you into trouble, however. Sometimes it’s good to generalize information, like “hot things shouldn’t be touched,” for example. However, if your partner cheats on you and you become paranoid that everyone will cheat on you, this can become a serious problem. The third thing we do when using our maps is to distort information. A map of a city distorts information because it's flat and smaller than the actual city. On your personal map, you might distort information by attributing meaning to things when you shouldn’t. Imagine one of your colleagues doesn’t greet you one day. Your map might tell you to believe that they’re angry with you – but they might just be late for a meeting. Conflict arises when people’s mind maps have them interpret the world differently, which is exactly why it’s important to expand your map as much as possible. Expanding your map is vital to living a happier life. When you broaden your map, you’re able to view the world from more perspectives. Your relationships also improve when you’re better at empathizing with other people’s feelings and opinions – and you’ll feel better, too. So it’s a good idea to check in with your map every now and then to make sure it’s up to date. Much like ordinary maps, mind maps can become outdated. When new roads are built or others are removed, a city map has to be changed; your personal map works the same way. Two common problems arise when you don’t keep your map up to date. First, you might imagine that you have constraints or limitations when you really don’t. Some people limit themselves out of fear, for instance. Maybe they don’t travel because they’re afraid of flying. These kind of fears only exist in our heads. We’re only born with two fundamental fears: a fear of loud noises and a fear of falling. All other fears are learned – which means they can be unlearned! Your map might also interfere with your life by making you believe that something works when it doesn’t. This often leads people into counterproductive behavior. Imagine your business partner betrays you. Your map might then tell you that it would be safest to never trust any business partners again. However, if you follow this assumption, you’re sure to always work alone. Do your best to avoid this sort of thinking; instead, reconsider how you choose your business partners. Have you ever thought about something scary and suddenly felt anxious? Not surprisingly, your thoughts have a major impact on how you feel, both physically and emotionally. Our thoughts are like images of a film reel – and they can profoundly alter our emotions. And, sticking with the same analogy, you can change your emotions by adjusting the colors, brightness or noise level of the images in your thoughts. Think of it like watching a film in a cinema instead of at home: it’s the same film either way, but the experience is better in the theater. So you can choose to minimize your negative feelings or amplify your positive feelings. But how? You can intensify a feeling by anchoring it to another form of stimulus you can control. Think of a happy experience, for example; it should be so good that you smile when you remember it. Now, imagine this experience is attached to a lever labeled “fun,” and pull the lever. This might feel silly, but when you come to associate that lever with a happy feeling, you can imagine pulling it whenever you’re feeling down. Your brain remembers the happy sensation and you’ll start feeling better. You can also use anchoring to quell your fears. One of the authors had a client who was able to use anchoring to overcome his fear of talking to women. He was afraid to approach them, but he was very into ski jumping, a sport where one skis off a mountain and flies off a ramp into the air at high speeds. The author helped the man anchor that feeling of excitement to the experience of talking to women. Once he leveraged the happiness he got from ski-jumping, he was much more comfortable with the opposite sex. Have you ever noticed that happy people improve your mood, while depressed people bring you down? Emotions are contagious. Other people’s emotions influence you, and your emotions influence other people in turn. One of the authors conducted an experiment on this phenomenon using yogurt. He separated a yogurt culture into two containers and attached one of the containers to a device that could measure the yogurt’s electrical activity. Then he poured milk, which yogurt “eats,” over the half that wasn’t attached to the device. Interestingly, when that half received the milk, the other half of the yogurt somehow picked up electrical activity. It “knew” the other half was getting the milk added to it. The researchers tried putting barriers between the yogurt, such as metal, wood or even electromagnetic fields, but the results were always the same. The author then placed a fish tank full of a different kind of yogurt between the first two containers of yogurt – this stopped the transmission of electric activity between them. The researchers asked the author how the first batch of yogurt could “tell” that the second batch was there. His reply was simply, “yogurt knows yogurt.” People work the same way: people know people. We spread our feelings like yogurt spreads electrical activity. Your mental state has a significant impact on how people interact with you. So, if you want to change someone’s feelings, you have to change your own feelings first. You can’t expect people to feel happy around you if you’re feeling depressed. If you’re in a bad mood, you’ll spread it to others around you. So, work on improving your own mental state through anchoring before you try to help with anyone else’s. You can’t make other people happy until you’re happy yourself. Have you ever clicked with someone as soon as you met them? If so, it was probably because your communication styles matched, both verbally and nonverbally. We naturally adjust our communication style to suit the person we’re talking to; it’s called matching. Matching is an important part of communicating effectively. You match with someone in different ways, such as through your breathing. You build a strong connection with another person when you breathe at the same rate as them. Synchronized breathing is more powerful when you do it subtly, so don’t go overboard. Matching your breathing should eventually become an unconscious behavior, like walking or driving a car through a familiar neighborhood. You can also influence people with pacing and leading. Humans naturally mimic each other's body language, so when you have someone’s attention you can influence their behavior. The author once attended a presentation in which, at one point, the presenter took a deep breath – and nearly all of the audience repeated the action. A person’s communication style also reveals a lot about the way they think. People tend to fall into one of three categories, depending on which sense they base their thinking on. Some people use visual imagery to describe the world and explain their thoughts. They use phrases like “It looks like” or “I see it.” Others rely more on their ears for understanding and communication. They say things like “That sounds okay” or “Stop telling me...” The third group communicates and understands the world through their feelings and physical sensations. They use phrases like “I feel great” or “I don’t grasp the idea.” You can strengthen your bond with someone by matching with them on their speaking style. If you mismatch, however, by using visual language when they use auditory language, you’ll distance yourself from them. We’ve looked at how our internal maps cause us to make generalizations about the world around us. But we also make generalizations about people, which can be a problem for communication. The meta model is a good tool for avoiding this, and challenging other people to expand their maps as well. The easiest way to understand the meta model is through an example. Imagine you come home from work and your partner says, “There’s been an accident.” What exactly do they mean? Was it a car accident? Did they burn dinner? Is someone hurt? Ask questions about the situation using the meta model: What? How? When? Where? Who? Each answer deepens your understanding. You also help enrich other people’s maps when you use the meta model. Imagine a person says, “Everybody hates me.” This, of course, is an absurd generalization and there’s no way it could possibly be true. Even so, this kind of generalization can completely undermine a person’s happiness. So if a friend says something like this, ask him who “everybody” is. After he gives a more specific answer, ask how he knows everybody hates him, or what makes him think so. Ask if there are any other possible interpretations of others’ behavior. The more you question this friend’s beliefs, the more likely he is to doubt them. If you do this the right way, you may be able to guide him into thinking more positively about himself. He might start to question and rework his own internal map. NLP doesn’t only help you overcome your own negativity, it can help you bring out positivity in others, too. Do you ever make yourself worried about the future by dwelling on the problems you’ve had in the past? Negative thoughts are powerful – so don’t let them control your future! Not letting your past control your future is a crucial aspect of maintaining your happiness. The author once did an exercise related to this in an NLP seminar. First he told the audience to breathe slowly and steadily, then he asked them to think about five wonderful events from their past that they could remember vividly. Then the author asked them to think of a future event they were worried about, and imagine it as the sixth event in the chain. This helped them feel more optimistic about it. Once they associated the future with happy memories in their past, they were more at ease with it. Another good way to overcome your negative feelings or bad habits is to make yourself feel stupid (strategically!). The author used this method to help a client who was endangering his life by eating too much chocolate. Instead of confronting the addiction head on, the author put some chocolate on a chair and had the man look at it. Then he said that the chocolate was smarter than him, and had more willpower and self-control than he did. The man started to feel foolish about his desire to eat the chocolate. Once he associated that feeling with his craving, he didn’t crave the chocolate anymore. After all, no one likes to feel stupid. Readjusting your thoughts isn’t only about feeling better about the future and overcoming cravings; when you have a positive outlook, you live a happier and more fulfilling life. The key message in this book: Taking control of your life starts with taking control of your mind. Most problems are rooted in your thoughts, whether it’s stress, fear, anxiety or a lack of self-discipline. Start making meaningful changes in your life using the principles of Neurolinguistic Programming. Your thoughts are powerful – use them to your advantage! Actionable advice: Ask thoughtful questions.  If someone tells you they’re depressed, don’t ask “Why?”, ask “How do you know?” If someone tells you they’re struggling with shyness, ask them “What would you do if you weren’t?” Got feedback?

In fact, modern life seems to be filled with stress from the time we get up in the morning until we go to bed at night. But what if the hectic pace is actually good for us? Though we usually think of stress as something negative, there’s another side to the story: through the ages it seems like our bodies have developed ways to handle stress in much more complex and ingenious ways than we realize. It may even help us grow stronger and healthier.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why being positive about stress increases longevity more than exercise does; how holding hands reduces the impact of stressful situations; and why people who are retired have an increased risk of depression.  We’ve all heard a million times that stress is bad for us and that it’s the cause of most illnesses. So why should we all of a sudden embrace it? Think about what stress really is: a reaction that occurs when something you care about is at stake. This could be your frustration over a traffic jam or your grief over the loss of a loved one.  In one 2006 US study, researchers discovered that high levels of stress increased the risk of death by as much as 43 percent. But this was only in people who believed stress was harmful. Those who reported high stress levels but didn’t believe it was harmful had the lowest risk of death of all participants, leading to the conclusion that stress is harmful – when you believe it is.  One study at Yale University showed that people who looked positively upon old age lived 7.6 years longer. That’s a lot more than the extra four years you earn by exercising and not smoking!  Positivity is a form of belief so powerful that it can influence your body’s health. Such beliefs can be considered mindsets: superior to preferences or learned facts. Usually based on your own understanding of how the world works, mindsets affect how you think, act and feel.  Your attitude toward stress is a central part of your mindset which shapes the choices you make in everyday life. If you view stress as harmful, you tend to try and avoid it at all costs. People who view stress as helpful, on the other hand, are more likely to come up with strategies to cope with the source of stress, seek help and make the best of the situation.  Are you a person who faces stress head-on? Chances are you’ll feel more confident about handling life’s challenges. In this way, the belief that stress is helpful becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. But what if stress makes you want to head for the hills? No need to fret! The following blinks will help you shift your mindset.  In the late 1990s, the trauma center of a hospital in Akron, Ohio, carried out an experiment on survivors of traffic accidents and found that they were able to accurately predict who would develop post-traumatic stress disorder. How? They based their predictions on the urine samples they collected from the survivors right after the crash.  Forty-six of the 55 patients had higher levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline in their urine, and did not suffer from PTSD. The remaining nine patients, with lower levels of stress hormones, did develop the disorder. This experiment made for powerful evidence that stress could lead to a better long-term recovery, even in deeply traumatic events.  So, despite what you might hear, stress isn’t all about a fight-or-flight response. It just doesn’t work that way in modern life. We can’t flee our relationships every time we have a disagreement, and we can’t break out into fistfights at the office when a deadline looms!  A fight-or-flight response is, of course, still valuable in the case of an assault or a burning building. But we also have the capacity to use stress to engage with challenges, connect with those around us and grow from the experience. There are several stress responses that help us to face difficulties with a positive outlook. One of these is the challenge response. It’s similar to the fight-or-flight response, but suited to situations that, while pressing, do not threaten your survival. The challenge response releases cortisol and adrenaline to generate a feeling of self-confidence and the motivation to learn from a tough experience.  Another positive stress response is the tend-and-befriend, which is where we talk to a close friend or loved one when feeling stressed. This action causes the release of hormone oxytocin. Commonly referred to as the love molecule, oxytocin encourages us to connect with others through caring social relationships.  As well as helping us deal with stress in the here and now, positive stress responses also leave an imprint on our brains, rather like a vaccine. These experiences teach our bodies and minds how to handle similar stress in the future. That’s why going through stress makes you better at coping with it in the long run. Sounds counterintuitive right? But just listen to this. In 2005 and 2006, researchers from the Gallup World Poll asked more than 125,000 people aged 15 and over if they had experienced a great deal of stress the day before.  On average, around a third of each country’s population said they experienced stress. The Philippines topped the poll with 67 percent of their population suffering from stress. The US wasn’t too far behind with a hefty 43 percent. Populations of other countries reported far less stress, with as low at 5 percent in the African nation Mauritania.  So how did these statistics line up with other data? Results surprised researchers. Nations that exhibited higher levels of stress were also likely to have a higher GDP, longer life expectancy and improved quality of living. Conversely, countries like Mauritania with low levels of stress were prone to high levels of corruption, poverty, hunger or violence.  This is what the author calls the stress paradox: happy lives contain stress, and stress-free lives don’t guarantee happiness. How can we explain this? Well, perhaps because a meaningful life is also necessarily a stressful one. According to a 2013 study at Stanford and Florida State University, people who reported the greatest number of stressful events in their past were most likely to consider their lives meaningful.  And what about you? Do you consider your life meaningful, and why? We often derive our sense of purpose from the different roles we play and responsibilities we have – in our jobs, as parents, and in our relationships. The activities that feel the most meaningful are precisely the ones that are the greatest sources of stress in our lives.  This was evidenced in two recent surveys in the UK and Canada. Thirty-four percent of participating UK adults stated that having a baby was the most stressful experience of their lives. And, 62 percent of participating Canadians deemed their careers to be their biggest source of stress.  Research also tells us that lives with less stress may also lack happiness. Humans tend to be happier when they are busy. This might explain why retirement, a time in life when we suddenly have less to do than we’re used to, increases the risk of depression by as much as 40 percent. With hundreds of articles, radio talks and editorials on the topic, stress seems to be one of the greatest conundrums of this century. Nearly everyone we know finds stress a struggle.  But what about those people who just seem to breeze through life? We all know at least one of them. Every so often, we come across people who cope with stress far better than others. So what do they do differently? It’s all to do with how they think about stress.  Your resilient coworker, neighbor or acquaintance is able to roll with the punches because they see stress as a normal part of life. Which it is! Without stress, we’d have far fewer opportunities to grow and learn. Additionally, accepting that stress is normal makes us less likely to view every challenge as a catastrophe.  These resilient people recognize that no matter how stressful things are, life does go on. They continue to make choices that will change the situation or themselves. But where does their reserve of strength come from? Interestingly enough, it often develops as a result of experiencing hard times in the past.  Theresa Betancourt, Associate Professor of Child Health and Human Rights at the Harvard School of Public Health, observed in Sierra Leone in 2002 that child soldiers who had been used as human shields, sex slaves, or had been forced to kill family members or commit rape, were very resilient. Why? The horrors they’d experienced in the past allowed them to see the bigger picture when facing problems on a day-to-day basis. Many even dreamed of becoming doctors, journalists and teachers. Even in extreme cases, past experiences of stress can endow us with strength and a positive outlook. Do you ever get so nervous that your palms begin to sweat like crazy? Or perhaps your heart feels like it’s pounding right out of your chest as your mouth gets drier than the Sahara. These are all very clear signs of your nerves, and usually you’ll berate yourself for letting your stress get the best of you! But is this the right way to go? Not always. Embracing anxiety actually helps us perform better. It just depends on how you channel it. To demonstrate this, Harvard Business School professor Alison Wood Brooks told some students who were about to give a speech to say “I am calm” to themselves, while others were instructed to say “I am excited.”  A simple trick, but it worked: the second group felt more confident in their presentation skills, handled the pressure more gracefully and were rated as more persuasive and competent speakers than those from the first group. Simply by shifting their mindset, the second group of speakers channeled their anxiety into an energy that boosted their performance enormously.  Repeating positive mantras like “I am excited” is one great way to channel your stress into strength. Embracing your anxiety is another strategy for shifting your mindset, and it’s quite an important one. Why? Because without it, you run the risk of falling into an anxiety-avoidance cycle.  The author, for example, was deeply afraid of flying. She resolved to never go on a plane, so she wouldn’t have to go through the anxiety. But by avoiding anxiety in this way, she let it get the better of her. Finally, the author got tired of missing out on seeing relatives or getting to explore new cities, so she decided to grit her teeth and face her anxiety instead. She still gets nervous on planes, but she knows that it’s worth it.  Stress isn’t just something we have to deal with. It’s also something that can help us learn to care, cooperate and show compassion a little better. So why not embrace it! Think back to the tend-and-befriend response we learned about earlier. This gives us a welcome opportunity to practice being social, brave and people-smart. How? First off, it fires up the social caregiving system by releasing oxytocin while inhibiting the fear centers of the brain. As a result, we feel more empathy, connection and trust toward one another. Simultaneously, the release of dopamine activates the reward system. This makes us feel confident and optimistic about our own abilities, and increases motivation while diminishing fear. Finally, the attunement system is switched on by the neurotransmitter serotonin. This enhances our perception, intuition and self-control, making it easier to understand what action we need to take to get the best results.  That’s a lot of biology to remember! The most important thing to keep in mind is that you activate the tend-and-befriend response every time you choose to help others. Even if it’s as simple as squeezing your partner’s hand during a scary movie! Simply showing care for someone can turn fear into hope, just like that.  A study at UCLA proved just this. Participants were told that their loved ones would be administered painful electric shocks. They were offered two different coping strategies to choose from: to squeeze a stress ball or hold a loved one’s hand.  Holding hands was shown to increase activity in the reward and caregiving centers of the brain, and decrease activity in the amygdala, a center responsible for fear and avoidance. The stress ball had no effect on the amygdala, confirming that most avoidance strategies cannot dispel distress or anxiety. Connecting with others during stress is in this way a scientifically proven way to respond to stress effectively. Think of a time in your life that led to positive changes, a newfound purpose or significant personal growth. It’s not unlikely that these times followed periods that were very stressful. That’s the paradox of stress! Although it’s frustrating, the paradox of stress makes a lot of sense, too.  The idea that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger is far from new. It can be found in the teachings of religions and philosophies for centuries. In fact, 82 percent of respondents in one study, when asked how they cope with stress in their lives, cited previous stressful experiences as sources of strength. In other words: adversity helps us learn and grow.  Living a sheltered life can actually do us more harm than good in the long run. Psychologist Mark Seery found that individuals unfamiliar with adversity were the least resilient to it.  He asked participants in a study to dunk their hands in ice-cold water. Participants unfamiliar with adversity found the cold to be the most painful and unpleasant, and took their hands out the fastest. What was going through their minds? Most of them reported thoughts about how “they couldn’t stand it.” By already discrediting their ability to cope, they only distressed themselves further.  Even if you’re currently facing a situation that’s a lot more stressful than sticking your hand in ice water, remember that your attitude toward stress will shape the outcomes as well as future challenges. It’s well known that men who find an upside to their first heart attack, e.g., a chance to change their priorities, have greater appreciation for life. Plus, people with better family relationships are less likely to suffer another heart attack.  The reality is that seeing the upside of things makes a dramatic improvement in our coping abilities. Rather than relying on ineffective avoidance strategies, people who see the upside are able to take proactive steps to deal with their stress. Even their bodies demonstrate a healthier physical response to stress: they have faster recovery times and a reduced risk of depression, heart attacks and diseases. The key message in this book: Despite what you may have thought, stress isn’t always bad for you. If you approach stressful experiences as something you can learn from, then you certainly will. Even our biological responses to stress allow us to deepen relationships, boost our confidence and increase our resilience.  Actionable advice:  Learn from stress today for more resilience tomorrow.  Next time you’re in the middle of something stressful, try to see the benefit of such a situation. How can you put this stress to good use? Simply by considering the answers to this question, you’ll be better able to overcome not only that situation, but future stressful situations you face, too.

Even if you’re fit, you may feel you need to diet. We don’t sleep enough; we’re constantly jumping on the next trend, be it superfoods or juicing. What is causing society’s unhealthy obsession with health? Previously only people who were sick made health a central issue. Healthy people, on the other hand, thought about politics, relationships or philosophy – in short, they focused on life in general, not the latest sniffle. So what’s different today? These blinks help you get to the bottom of the wellness craze to figure out how we can heal ourselves in the right way. In these blinks, you’ll find out how being health conscious can harm a budding philosopher; why eating cookies makes you feel guilty; and how an obsession with wellness distorts government welfare policy. Many people consider the pursuit of wellness a lifelong goal. To stay on track, these people avoid “unhealthy” influences, whether it be eating fatty pork chops or smoking cigarettes. They head to a Pilates class daily and occasionally enjoy some pampering at a fancy spa. Eating correctly and exercising daily – what’s wrong with that? Well, we first have to consider that “wellness” means more than exercising regularly and eating healthily. Wellness is an ideology; it holds that a healthy body is a necessary state for success and happiness in life. Thinking this way marks a significant societal change. If you cared about your looks and health decades ago, people would think you vain and superficial. Today, the cult of wellness stresses that to be successful in everything in life, you need a fat-free, fit body and a clear, capable state of mind. The problem is that adhering to such an ideology compulsively can limit your freedom of thought, causing you to miss important experiences. The wellness doctrine is based on a narrow way of thinking that revolves exclusively around health while forbidding many activities such as drinking or taking recreational drugs. Such activities society used to view as not only enjoyable but also important rites of passage. Many American universities now require students to sign a wellness contract upon enrollment. Students pledge to abstain from alcohol and drugs and devote themselves to living healthily. Yet these straight-edge students will undoubtedly miss out on youthful experiences that once inspired society’s greatest thinkers. French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre famously indulged in coffee, cigarettes and alcohol while at school, his circle of friends enjoying discussions of absurdity and revolution. Such experiences were mind-expanding! Contemporary students of philosophy pushed to follow the tenets of wellness might miss out. So it’s clear that being obsessed with health isn’t healthy. But shouldn’t this at least mean the end of people judging a person’s character based on physical appearance? Well, not exactly. People now face a moral imperative from society to be both healthy and happy. Slovenian philosopher Alenka Zupančič has dubbed this biomorality – people must take care of their bodies because not doing so means they are stupid or irresponsible. It is a moral judgment – healthy people concerned about their bodies are good people, and unhealthy people are bad people. Such a mentality explains why people view those who are obese as lazy or not trying hard enough, if at all, to improve their health. In doing so, obese people are evading their moral and social responsibilities. Television has capitalized on this tendency to equate “fat” with “bad” and “healthy” with “good.” English chef Jamie Oliver has a show called “Jamie’s School Dinners,” on which he has been critical of unhealthy eating among school children. The show demonized parents for letting school children have food like potato chips and sugary soda. While it is, of course, not healthy for children to consume processed foods, Oliver jumps at the opportunity on his show to shame offending parents, calling them indifferent to their children’s health and welfare – an unfair assessment, as Oliver at no point takes into consideration a family’s income or social situation. Similarly, smoking has become another way to judge a person’s social morality. Smokers are thought of as more “stupid” and “selfish” than people who don’t smoke. The crucial point is that biomorality has led us to focus all our attention on the physical body, socially shaming people into following a wellness lifestyle and in doing so, keeping them occupied with diets and fads as to not question the moral assumptions of such obsessions. It’s a never-ending cycle. The quest for a perfect body is eternal, and you can always “do better.” The irony is that, by striving to meet unreachable goals, eager to be on the side of the “good,” we end up with less time to engage with people socially. Doing so might help us rediscover the things that make our peers morally upstanding, like being helpful or caring. Wellness as an ideology works against itself. When we try to follow its tenets and “feel better,” in reality, our quest for wellness can make us feel worse. We put intense pressure on ourselves to adhere to a wellness doctrine by eating correctly and exercising. All of this stress compounds, leaving us full of guilt and self-blame anytime we might slip off base and “cheat” with unhealthy foods or skipping a workout session. When being “well” is synonymous with being “good,” eating a cookie becomes a criminal act, inspiring frustration and self-hatred. Worse, trying to hide your seeming moral weakness from others can be isolating. For instance, if you feel guilty for quitting a diet, you might avoid friends to hide the extra pounds you may have gained as a result. Following such a judgmental doctrine also leads to overexertion and feelings of anxiety when we fail. We conflate our successes and general happiness with the ability to follow strict exercise protocols, even after a long, exhausting day at work. Within such a system, failure is inevitable. Your body will eventually force you to rest! When this happens, wellness devotees can become overwhelmed with anxiety, as clearly this failure will lead to others, and a good life will remain out of reach. This becomes a vicious cycle, sapping energy and leaving you less capable of meeting goals and, in turn, making you more anxious. Some people even try to fight through exhaustion by doing even more – spending all their free time at the gym and spare cash on life coaches. In this way, the wellness doctrine works contrary to our natural instinct to rest and indulge occasionally. What sort of society does an obsession with wellness create? As you’ll see in the next blink, we’ve built a community of highly functioning neurotic machines with a single life purpose – to work. Most major companies today offer employees courses to learn how to relax or quit smoking. Many also have set up private gyms for employee use. Such caring gestures are appreciated; who doesn’t want a boss who clearly cares about your well-being? There is, however, a dark side to wellness at work. Wellness programs reinforce the idea that only you are responsible for your well-being, workplace satisfaction and success. It is certainly bad for your health to work long hours for poor wages, concerned about being fired at any moment. But the wellness doctrine maintains that employees can thrive under any conditions as long as they think positively, live a healthy lifestyle and know how to relax. For example, Google offers its employees mindfulness courses; they are popular. Workers learn to relax by focusing on the present moment and breathing. This practice ideally helps employees deal with stressful situations that arise at work or in general. While being mindful can help in life, this also carries the implication that each employee takes it upon himself to manage often overwhelming workloads; a busy schedule isn’t to blame for employee stress. Beyond that, a wellness culture can create competition among employees, ensuring that everyone work as much as possible. Wellness teaches us that we can do anything if we optimize our minds and bodies – clearly more beneficial to a company than its overworked employees. These practices are further supported by health apps which encourage people to monitor performance and compete with others. A wellness ideology is also a powerful tool in politics, especially for politicians who necessarily want to distract or divert attention from one issue to another. After all, wellness is a spiritual quest for health and happiness or personal well-being. Politics, on the other hand, requires collective thinking to improve the state of a nation. So while the wellness movement might not seem overtly political on the surface, it can serve a political function: drawing the attention of the middle class away from the needs of society. Politicians can act without facing blowback from a public largely distracted by personal concerns. A profound political effect of the wellness doctrine is that it helps justify cuts to the welfare state. In the 1990s, both British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President Bill Clinton pushed through massive welfare reforms, claiming that people who expected money from the government would just become lazy and stop looking for work. Such arguments are intimately related to the wellness ideology. What politicians here were doing was holding people responsible for their success or failures – regardless of economic conditions. So if a person lost his job and couldn’t find employment, the wellness ideology says it’s not the job market’s fault but the fault of the individual for having the wrong mind-set. Maybe the person didn’t want a job badly enough or didn’t have the stamina to work harder. People already employed and financially comfortable bought into this sort of thinking, and viewed the unemployed and poor as a lazier class. As a result, people became reluctant to help others in need or stand up to government policy on their behalf. So, while the craze for wellness might seem to push people to become healthier, it’s dividing society and increasing and legitimizing injustices. The key message in this book: Wellness, self-improvement and healthy living have been used as a ploy to make people slaves to work, oblivious to society’s needs and so focused on personal success that they can’t see how others are suffering. This obsession has blinded us to the facts and the power we have to change them.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Research shows that people with stronger willpower are better off in almost every aspect of life: they’re happier and healthier, have more satisfying and long-lasting relationships, are more successful, make more money – and even live longer. In a nutshell, if you want to improve your life, your willpower is a good place to start. In The Willpower Instinct you'll read why you shouldn't deprive yourself of your favorite foods when dieting, and you'll discover why thinking that you hold no prejudices will make you act in a more prejudiced way. Finally, you’ll learn how you can improve your willpower by placing that bowl of sweets right in front of your nose – it’s for your own good. Life is full of temptations: you may be offered a chocolate chip cookie right after you've started a diet, or find a pack of cigarettes just as you've resolved to quit smoking. These situations are willpower challenges – a challenge in which your immediate desires fight with your long-term goals.  So what makes you able to exert self-control in these situations?  The strength of your willpower, which consists of three powers: “I won’t,\" “I will,\" and “I want.\" First, your “I won’t” power is the ability to say no even when your whole body wants to say yes. This power covers the common conception of willpower: the ability to resist temptation. Temptation comes to each of us in different forms, be it chocolate, cigarettes or a sexy stranger. And each temptation can be seen as an “I won’t” willpower challenge that asks: Do you have the strength to say no? You can determine your most important “I won’t” challenge by asking yourself: Which habit that is hurting your health, happiness or career would you most like to give up? The second element of willpower is your “I will” power – the ability to do what you dislike now for a better future. Your \"I will\" power helps you accomplish those tasks that are both unpleasant and necessary to achieve your goals – for example, studying to pass exams and get a degree. You can find your most important “I will” challenge by asking yourself: Which habit should you stop putting off in order to improve your life?  Finally, there’s your “I want” power – the capacity to remember what you truly want. What you truly want is what is best for you in the long term – despite present temptations. To resist the present you need a clear long-term goal that guides your actions. It’s this goal that fuels your “I want” power by reminding you what’s at stake. You can find your “I want” challenge by asking yourself: What is the number one long-term goal you would like to focus more energy on? Which immediate desires are keeping you away from it? These days, distractions are everywhere: there are links to click, series to watch, parties to go to. I’ll just check my email one last time, we say to ourselves. But you’re running a larger risk that you think. That’s because when you are distracted, you are actually more likely to give in to other temptations. When your mind is preoccupied, immediate temptation can more easily overshadow your long-term goals. This was shown in a study where students were instructed to remember a telephone number while making a choice between which snack to eat during the experiment: chocolate or fruit.  The students with their mind distracted chose the chocolate 50 percent more often than a group of students who were given no memorization task. But there is a way to deal with distractions – by raising your awareness through meditation. Neuroscientists have discovered that people who meditate have more grey matter – indicating higher levels of performance – in the regions of the brain responsible for self-awareness. Meditation cultivates a moment-to-moment self-awareness which helps us realize when we are being distracted and refocus our energy back on the task at hand. In fact, scientists have shown that it only takes three hours of regular meditation to improve self-control and develop a higher attention span, and after 11 hours of practice the changes are already observable in the brain. But sometimes distractions feel overwhelming, and you feel like you just can’t stop watching that clip. In such situations the fruits of meditation can help again: by taking a breath and refocusing your concentration on the long-term goal at hand, you can break the distraction cycle and regain control over your impulses. When your mind is preoccupied you lose significant amounts of willpower. Avoiding decision making when distracted and increasing your self-awareness through meditation can help to save you from willpower failures.  What does a saber-toothed tiger have in common with a chocolate cookie? Each of them can interfere with your goal of a long and healthy life. That’s why evolution has given us the instincts to fight both the saber-toothed tiger and the temptation of a chocolate cookie. You have probably heard of the fight-or-flight response, an instinct that kicks in when we face scary or life-threatening situations. Basically, it’s your body’s built-in ability to devote all its energy to getting your butt out of an emergency. What most of us don't know is that willpower itself is based on a biological instinct. One study showed that facing a willpower challenge can activate a specific state in your brain and body that gives you a willpower boost. This state is called the pause-and-plan response, and as its name suggests, it is very different from the fight-or-flight response: While the fight-or-flight response heightens your awareness of an external threat and increases your speed (to avoid the tiger), the pause-and-plan response shifts your focus to the internal conflict between your rational and impulsive selves, and slows you down to help control your impulse (to avoid the cookie). So how can we strengthen this willpower instinct to better slow down our minds and make the best decisions? By paying close attention to everything that places stress on our minds and body, like anger, anxiety, chronic pain and illness. All the things that stress you out interfere with your ability to get into a state of self-control by keeping you in that fight-or-flight state – and preventing you from achieving that slow, rational state of mind. However, there are plenty of ways to improve your stress-resistance and thereby your willpower. Meditation, exercise, a good night's sleep, healthy food and quality time with your family and friends can all help reduce your levels of stress. And getting active outdoors for only five minutes a day will give you a quick willpower boost too – so get out there! Ever helped a friend move? At the end of the day your muscles are so tired you couldn’t carry anything more even if you wanted to. You might say to yourself, \"I should be hitting the gym more often, I would be less tired\". For your willpower, it’s just the same: after flexing your willpower muscle too much you become exhausted and can’t control yourself anymore. And if you hit the willpower gym, you could improve the strength of your willpower muscle.  So why does overusing your willpower cause you to run out of it? Because every successful attempt to exert self-control draws from the same limited source.  This means that resisting a temptation will not only weaken your ability to avoid other temptations, but also prompt procrastination and other willpower failures.  And this willpower exhaustion happens all the time.  This is because many daily tasks you would not think of as willpower challenges – having to commute, sit through a boring meeting or choose between 20 brands of shampoo – all draw from our limited daily willpower reserve.  But although we are constantly draining our willpower, we can do our best to maintain it at a high level by keeping our blood sugar steady and our energy levels high.  Low-glycemic foods such as nuts, cereals, fruits, vegetables and high-fiber grains all contribute to resourcing our willpower. But there is another way of improving our willpower – by training the willpower muscle. Just as it’s possible to train your arm muscle through weight lifting, it’s possible to train your willpower muscle with willpower challenges. By performing small but regular willpower challenges you can gradually improve your self control.  For example, keep a forbidden candy jar in an easily visible location you’re never allowed to touch – no matter how tempting it looks. Regularly practicing with this small temptation will train your willpower muscle, which will help you cope when it comes to larger willpower challenges. In the next blinks, you’ll discover why we often succumb to our desires. Hardly a week passes without news about the moral failures of upstanding citizens – politicians, athletes or religious leaders who have done something wrong. Why do these supposedly virtuous people make such large mistakes? Actually, thinking that you are “virtuous” lowers your self-awareness and discipline. This was shown in a study where a group of university students were asked to agree or disagree with strongly sexist statements. Not surprisingly, very few agreed. A control group then received milder versions of the same sexist statements, and this time many more people agreed. But when both groups had to make a decision in a hypothetical hiring situation, it was paradoxically the students who disagreed with the highly sexist statements who were more likely to discriminate against female candidates than the students from the group who had agreed to the milder versions. And the exact same pattern emerged when racist statements were used. This is because when we feel we are being virtuous enough, we see less need to control ourselves. And this is exactly what happened in the experiment. After the students proved to themselves that they were not sexist by rejecting a statement, they then paid less attention to their actual behavior in the hiring task. Another example of using good past behavior to excuse present bad behavior is when we give ourselves something “bad” as a reward for being good – for example, eating a doughnut after a long workout. However, this is counter-productive: giving yourself a reward which undermines your long-term goal is not a promising strategy for success.        So don’t allow your successes to loosen your self-discipline. Otherwise you might find yourself nullifying your progress by allowing your self-indulgent behavior. Instead, stick to a rule which serves your goal, but is not so challenging that you can’t stick to it every single day without failure. Why do we often feel bad and guilty after satisfying our immediate desires, like buying a new sweater we don’t need, or spending a lazy evening in front of the TV? And why do we do it again and again, despite knowing better? Because your brain’s reward system is not always your friend – and sometimes it leads you in the wrong direction. So what exactly happens in the brain when you crave something? First you see or smell something you desire – and just that is enough to activate the reward system in the brain.  The system releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine which activates the areas of the brain responsible for attention, motivation and action. These dopamine releases can be triggered by anything we have associated with feeling good: a 70-percent-off sale sign at a mall, the smell of a rib-eye steak (or a vegan burger), or an attractive face smiling at you.  And when this dopamine is released, the object that pulled the trigger immediately becomes very desirable – even if it’s against our long-term interest, like unhealthy food, internet binges, binge drinking or one night stands. This is why we engage in activities that seem to be irresistible at first glance, but afterward leave us feeling guilty and dissatisfied.  Our prehistoric ancestors, however, were not troubled by this reward mechanism. In fact, being attracted to sweet things was to their advantage, as sweet fruit and berries were a crucial part of their diet. Our ancestors were also more free to pursue sexual impulses without modern-day societal constraints.  But even though this impulsive mechanism isn’t as useful in our day and age, it’s still there, and we have to make sure it doesn’t push us toward unhealthy or unwise choices.  So what can you do? You can actually make this weakness your strength by combining unpleasant tasks with something that gets your dopamine firing. For example, bring your boring paperwork to your favorite café and finish it over a delicious cup of hot chocolate. Stress is a common source of unhappiness. It can be caused by professional or personal worries, but also by external events, like bad news in the media. Stress is one of the biggest threats to your willpower because it induces dreaded cravings. How? Stress makes you feel bad about yourself, which motivates you to do something to make yourself feel better. Unfortunately sometimes the easiest way to feel better is by doing the very thing you’ll later feel bad about. For example, losing money at the casino can make you feel so upset that you continue gambling in order to win a game – and thereby relieve the stress. But this impulse might actually lead you to greater and greater risks, and eventually lose you a fortune. So how can you overcome this? When you feel stressed, don’t give in to immediate cravings. Instead try out stress-relief strategies that have a more sustainable effect, like exercise or meditation. These activities might involve more effort, but will leave you with a feeling of satisfaction, not guilt. But don’t make unrealistic resolutions to counter stress – you’re more likely to give up early. When people reach a low point in their lives, like facing an enormous mortgage, they often decide to drastically change their life. For example, we might resolve to cut back all our expenses by 25 percent to get our finances back on track. That’s a big change, and such big resolutions often feel like they can completely transform our life: we imagine being free of problems, people treating us completely differently and so forth – just because of this one change. This boosts our self-confidence. However, this can backfire, for the higher we set our goal, the more difficult it is to stay on track. Failure to meet our expectations then leads us to frustration, guilt and self-doubt, and soon we typically abandon our efforts altogether. To avoid this fate, remember: when you fail to achieve your goals, don’t despair. Just forgive yourself and try again. Do you ever overcommit yourself to responsibilities and later find yourself overwhelmed? Do you sometimes regret your past choices when confronted with their actual costs? Both phenomena are caused by our inability to imagine the future clearly – and especially to imagine our future selves. We don’t see our future selves as ourselves, but as distant, different people. Our brain perceives them as strangers due to our inability to observe their thoughts and feelings. This can lead to us putting off tasks, hoping that our future-self will have more willpower to deal with them – or even worse, racking up debt and hoping our future selves will be able to pay. These hopes lead nowhere because your future-self is not different from your present self, and will also struggle when facing challenges, be it mustering the willpower to do an unpleasant task or balancing the budget. So what can we do? A good method for becoming more familiar with your future-self is visualization: imagine your future-self thinking back on the decisions you are making today and their consequences. So what else makes us neglect our future selves? Our vulnerability to instant gratification. When a tempting object is staring right at you, resistance often feels futile because the reward system in our brain reacts so strongly to visible rewards. Why? Because visible rewards make us overestimate the benefits of instant gratification and underestimate the value of exerting self-control. This leads us to make decisions that our future selves later regret. But temptation becomes weaker if you then create some distance between you and the object – for example, by making it less visible or more difficult to reach. This was shown in a study where office workers had access to candy. When the candy was placed out of sight inside a desk drawer instead of on the top of the table, the subjects’ candy consumption was reduced by one third. Here’s a challenge: for the next five minutes don't think about white bears. Can you do it? Most people fail in this task. Even though we never usually think about white bears, if you actively try to not think about them, it becomes almost impossible to stop.         The same is true for your cravings: though suppression might seem to work at first, it actually makes them worse. This was shown by one researcher who believed that thought suppression compels us to do the very thing we are trying to not think about. To test his hypothesis, he invited women for a tasting test of two similar chocolates. Before bringing in the candy, he asked the participants to think out loud for five minutes. One group was instructed to suppress any thoughts about chocolate, while the other participants were free to think about whatever they wanted. And as expected, the group that received the instructions not to think about chocolate reported fewer thoughts about chocolate – but also ate twice as much of the candy. This is also the reason why most diets simply don’t work. The more dieters try and resist a certain food, the more their mind becomes preoccupied by it. So how can you overcome cravings without pushing them away? When you’re on a diet, don’t deprive yourself of your favorite foods because it will only increase your cravings. Instead of deciding “you won't” eat fast food or cupcakes, devote your energy to the idea that “you will” eat more healthy food. A decline in unhealthy food will automatically follow and you'll have a much easier time sticking to such a positive challenge. Another way to overcome cravings is by merely observing them: When the unwanted urge appears, allow yourself to notice it. Observe your breath and what you are feeling. Then imagine the urge is a cloud which dissolves and passes on by. This technique, inspired by mindfulness traditions, is especially useful if you want to rid yourself of an unpleasant habit like smoking. In the final blink, you’ll discover the key environmental factors that affect our willpower. Have you ever noticed that you behave and think differently depending on who you're with? In fact, who we interact with influences our beliefs, goals and actions to a remarkable degree. And even characteristics like a strong or weak willpower can be \"picked up\" from our social context. For example, studies showed that if we observe other people acting impulsively, we are more likely to be impulsive ourselves and neglect our long-term goals for a pleasurable moment. What's more, the more we like the person observed, the stronger this effect is, and the more willpower we lose. Luckily this mechanism can also be harnessed for good, for example, with dieting: research shows that having a close friend or family member who recently lost a lot of weight increases your chances of also losing weight. So how can you take advantage of this? Ask yourself, do you know someone you admire for their willpower? Try thinking about them more often – because research shows that just thinking about someone with good self-control increases your own willpower. Another way of harnessing the force of willpower contagion is to get friends and family involved with your willpower challenges. The power of this approach was shown in the weight-loss intervention at the University of Pittsburgh that requires people to enroll with a friend or family member. The participants were then instructed to support each other in pursuing their goals – for example, by writing encouraging messages or sharing a healthy meal from time to time. The results were impressive: 66 percent of the participants had maintained their weight loss when checked on ten months later. In contrast, the success rate of the control group – the participants that did not join with a partner – was only 24 percent.  So if you and your loved ones share a willpower challenge, make it a group project! The key message in this book:                                                                        By learning how to concentrate on our long-term goals, maintain our willpower supply and train our willpower muscle, we can gain greater control over our bad habits – and live more fulfilling lives. Actionable advice: Keep close track of how you are managing your willpower challenges. For at least one day, try to observe your decisions very closely. Were there situations you could have avoided to better maintain your willpower supply? Were there times when you gave in to an impulse because you lost sight of your long-term goal? Pinpoint your weaknesses and visualize yourself overcoming them. Regularly refill your willpower with mindfulness. Try the five-minute brain training meditation: focus on your breath using the words “inhale” and “exhale” in your mind, and when your mind wanders, just notice it and bring it back to your breath.","headers":["What’s in it for me: discover how you can better wield your willpower to achieve your goals.","Willpower consists of three forces: I will, I won’t and I want.","Meditating increases awareness and helps avoid distractions – which in turn boosts self-control.","Willpower is a biological instinct that protects us from harm in the long term.","Willpower is like a muscle – it can be trained but also overused.","Don't indulge in the present because you think you've done well in the past.","When the reward system of your brain takes over, temptation becomes almost irresistible.  ","Feeling bad undermines willpower by triggering cravings and high expectations.","When we are too focused on the present moment, we make bad long-term decisions.              ","Attempts to push aside unwanted desires actually make them stronger.","Willpower is contagious: our social environment can increase and decrease our willpower.","Final Summary"],"category":"Personal Growth","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/53444b856432320007070000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"The Willpower Instinct introduces the latest insights into willpower from different scientific fields, such as psychology, neuroscience, economics and medicine.

But all too often, it seems there are obstacles keeping us from our wants at every turn. We might even feel like victims, stuck in a situation that we have no power to change. What if the solution to our problems was simply a change in thinking? These blinks show you how to live “above the line” and leave behind the victim mentality. Through a four-step process, you’ll learn how to recognize and achieve your goals and in turn, change your mind and your life. Personal accountability will become a principle that defines not just one, but all aspects of your life, improving yourself and the lives of those you care about. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: how Alexander the Great motivated his greatly outnumbered army to fight; how a struggling young man from Detroit became one of the world’s top neurosurgeons; and how the parents of a murder victim are creating positive change in the lives of hundreds. Let’s say you work in a job that you really hate. The hours are long, the work is tedious and mind-numbing, and worst of all, the pay is poor. But instead of seeking a new job, you simply moan and complain, saying that there aren’t enough jobs in the area, that only people with the right connections get the good jobs – that nothing is going right for me! Many of us have felt this way at some stage. Yet as common as this mind-set may be, it does nothing to improve our lives. If you really want to make a change for the better, you can’t blame others. Instead, you have to take responsibility for yourself, your job and your happiness: this is personal accountability. Often, however, being accountable for something feels like a burden. We often seek to shed responsibility as much as possible, by passing it on to our bosses, the government or relatives. But if you delegate your responsibilities, you become reliant on others. You are giving away the power to change yourself. The only way you can improve your life is to become accountable for it. This is a truth you must accept; and only then can you find a new job, and gain more qualifications and experience. It’s true that sometimes, situations can seem too overwhelming. But getting up after you’ve been knocked down is a choice that you make. With personal accountability, you can achieve your aims and control your circumstances: your choices are yours to make. But what exactly should you choose? Read on to find out. Think back to when you faced a tough challenge – a mountain of overdue work, or bills you couldn’t pay. When searching for a solution, how did you feel when you thought about the problem? Typically there are two ways to think about a challenge: above the line and below the line. When we think below the line we consider ourselves victims, and point the finger of blame at others. Yet when we think above the line, we look constructively at a problem and try to solve it. Let’s look at one example. As vice president of sales, Dennis faced the challenge of no new products for the third year in a row. He called a meeting with his other sales managers, who were frustrated that they had to sell the same old products in which customers had no longer any interest. For the first 30 minutes of the meeting, Dennis allowed his staff to think below the line, to get their complaints and frustrations off their chest. But then he got down to business and encouraged his staff to think above the line. By shifting the tenor of the conversation from complaints to real change, Dennis and his team developed creative sales strategies that they eventually turned into record sales. Thinking below the line can be a perfectly natural response: you often see yourself as a victim when you are not to blame for your troubles, as during a natural disaster or when you’re a victim of crime. But how you react to these events remains your choice. In 1989, Adam Walsh, the six-year-old son of John and Revé Walsh, was kidnapped and shortly thereafter found dead. Yet even in the wake of such a brutal act, the couple managed to think above the line and took action to help others. They have since worked to create support systems, develop preventative measures and improve legislation for cases of missing children. So how can you turn thinking above the line into positive change? Learn in the next blinks. When two people who have witnessed the same event are asked to describe what they saw, you’ll unquestionably get two different versions of the event. It’s the same with common problems we all face. While one person may see a challenge as life-ending, another may see the situation as an opportunity to change their life for the better. What you see is not reality; it is just your reality. And in many cases, what you might see may not reveal all the things you need to know. We all have blind spots, areas of our lives that we don’t view in enough detail or pay enough attention to. Luis thought he was a successful businessman and a loving father and husband. Then one day his wife left him, seemingly out of the blue. He couldn’t believe it! The problem was, Luis had blind spots. He only saw success in his life, but didn’t realize he wasn’t spending enough time with his family, and that he and his wife were drifting apart. If you want to be personally accountable, you cannot let blind spots hide your problems. But how do you find these blind spots, if you’re “blind” to them? The best way is to constantly seek feedback from others. This is especially important if, like Luis, you think everything’s great and you think you have few if any problems. Others may be able to see your situation from a different, often enlightening perspective. Consider 13-year-old Jessie. She is a soccer player who is unhappy as she’s always sitting on the bench during games. Finally one day she asked her coach why she wasn’t playing. He told her simply that she wasn’t good enough – and this changed everything! Instead of getting angry or sad, Jessie decided to up her game by practicing and building her skills. She soon became a regular player. By seeking out blind spots through awareness and feedback, we strengthen our vision and are able to “see it,” the first step toward personal accountability. People who rent their homes are more likely to overlook repairs or things that are broken. Yet people who own their homes are more conscientious about the state of their property. Does this surprise you? Once again, the reason why lies in accountability. To be personally accountable for a situation or problem, you have to take ownership of it. Owning something, whether it be a house, your job or even your health, means you become totally committed to it, and don’t act in half measures! Let’s explore some statistics that support this idea. Some 70% of working Americans don’t feel engaged at their work. They don’t feel personally accountable; instead, they only want the time to pass quickly so they can go home. This means they aren’t doing the best job they could do. If this 70% decided instead to own their job, they would approach it in a radically different way. With every failure or criticism, they’d hold themselves personally accountable and do whatever they could to improve – working a little later, or even doing more than what’s expected. In this way, they’d perform better and better all the time, soon standing out from their colleagues and having a better chance of receiving promotions or rewards. Only if you own something can you start to take responsibility for it – an important step toward making real change. Yet there are still two more steps to come! You’re well on your way to identifying problems in your life – but what use is this if you don’t know how to solve those problems? Unfortunately there’s no formula that works like a charm every time. Instead, you’ll need to create your own way to overcome obstacles, and this may require perseverance. Developing your own route to success can be daunting, and you may at first fail. But solving a problem is all about keeping on, even when times are tough. Remember that each failure is a learning experience, in which you figure out what doesn’t work, to come closer to solutions that will. Perhaps you’ve seen “Gold Rush” on the Discovery Channel, where groups challenge each other to find buried treasure. To find the gold, each group has to work hard and dig up huge amounts of empty land, often to no avail. The successful teams are those that don’t give up. It’s the same with life’s obstacles – a lot of attempts that end in failure may be necessary, but in the end, you’ll get the gold! Another great example of the power of perseverance can be found in the story of Heather Dorniden. Dorniden competed as a junior athlete in a crucial 600-meter track race, and during the race, in front of the crowd, she fell flat on her face. What did she do? She got right back up again, kept running and – would you believe – won the race. So how can you find this kind of perseverance? One useful method is to think of what you’re doing as if your life depends upon it. Literally, think that failure would be the end of the world. This attitude will help you bring all your energy into play. So far you’ve learned how to recognize obstacles, overcome them and own what you want to achieve. Now, you’re finally ready to take action and realize your desired change. So how can you do this successfully? One useful method is to convince yourself that there’s no way back. Thinking this will eliminate failure as an option. Alexander the Great used this strategy to great success. To motivate his soldiers to fight the Persian army that vastly outnumbered his own, he burnt his troops’ ships after landing. There was literally no way back, no place to retreat to – fighting and winning was the only possibility. Granted, you need not be so drastic, but the same principle applies. So if you want to meet new friends, as one example, go to a place where you hope to meet new people and commit yourself by shutting the door behind you. You will then have no choice but to introduce yourself to others! Whatever change you decide to make, know that all big changes can be difficult to sustain. You might start quickly and run out of steam, or fail to plan and end up going round in circles. How can you avoid this? One simple tool is to ensure you choose the right company. Many “friends” won’t encourage you to keep going. What you need are friends that will help you move forward and achieve your goals. Personal accountability isn’t just something you should strive for in one aspect of your life. Instead, it should touch everything, from your family life to work life and friendships. Make personal accountability a habit. The four steps, or seeing the problem, owning the problem, solving the problem and doing what is needed to change it, should be how you live your life, not simply a one-time lucky moment. Remember that the world is better above the line – here you have more influence, more enjoyment and more achievement. But you have to invest in this sort of positive thinking, otherwise you may quickly lose yourself in the self-pity blame game. Once you start thinking and living above the line, you’ll see the benefits of accountability blossom in other people’s lives, too. People who choose personal accountability have better relationships with their partners, colleagues and family. With the ability to notice problems previously masked by blind spots, such people can address and resolve issues with partners earlier and maintain healthy relationships. However, accountability can only go so far. You are not responsible for everything, and you can’t change all situations. Remember, personal accountability isn’t about changing what’s already happened, but about how you respond to the challenges life hands you. Ben Carson lived a life full of disadvantages. He grew up poor in a problematic area of Detroit, and was raised alone by his mother. While he knew he couldn’t change his past, he could take responsibility for himself to create a better future. Carson committed himself to his education, and became one of the leading neurosurgeons in the United States. If you accept full accountability for your actions, you can create amazing change and build the future that you want. The key message in this book: Even though it may seem that you are a victim of your situation, by changing how you think, you can instead assume personal accountability for your life. This new perspective not only helps you realize what you really want and where your problems lie but also helps you achieve your goals through a four-step path: seeing it, owning it, solving it and doing it.  Actionable advice: Let your frustrations out; then get to work! When facing adversity, such as being fired from a job, it’s perfectly normal to think below the line, and see yourself as a victim of fate. Give yourself time to express your frustration, and then prepare yourself to think above the line and take charge to create positive change!

Or maybe you’ve been working for a while now and are frustrated with the results so far. Either way, you’ve probably encountered a few challenges that you’re eager to overcome, so why not get some advice from the world’s top performers, the people who’ve already secured positions as pillars of their respective fields? Tim Ferriss, the author of Tribe of Mentors and a rather well-respected entrepreneur in his own right, set out to create a handy guidebook for anyone looking for a little inspiration – a book of insightful and meaningful advice from some of the world’s brightest minds. Feeling the need for a motivational boost? Dive in to find some of the juiciest bits of advice! In these blinks, you’ll discover the one book that both Terry Crews and Jimmy Fallon hold dear; the one self-investment that most mentors couldn’t do without; and how “forest bathing” can come in handy. The word “success” means different things to different people, but most of us would agree that being known to the world as a leader or a mentor is indicative of a high level of accomplishment. That’s why, when trying to pinpoint the habits of successful people, the author interviewed a series of renowned leaders and mentors. So what did he discover? If asked to list the habits of success, you might not put reading at the top – and yet the author found that, for many leaders, books are an important source of inspiration. For instance, the British journalist Matt Ridley, whose books on science and economics have sold millions of copies and been translated into over 30 languages, cherishes The Selfish Gene, by Richard Dawkins. Dawkins’s book not only provided Ridley with an answer to that most pressing of questions, “What is life?” – it revolutionized how people write about science and think about evolutionary biology. In general, the books that mentors hold dear tend to offer spiritual or personal guidance. Both the talk-show host Jimmy Fallon and the actor and former NFL star Terry Crews value Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning. Fallon believes the book made him a better person, and it keeps Crews focused on what’s truly important in life. Social science researcher and TED Talk superstar Dr. Brené Brown says that Harriet Lerner’s Why Won’t You Apologize? revolutionized her approach to apologizing. And then there’s that infamous book, The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand, which taught Wired magazine cofounder Kevin Kelly the importance of self-reliance – so much so that he dropped out of school after reading it! Five-time Grand Slam tennis champion Maria Sharapova gained priceless insight into happiness from The Beggar and the Secret of Happiness: A True Story, by Joel ben Izzy. Even children’s books can contain life-changing insights: TED Talk curator Chris Anderson will never forget the way C. S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia ignited his imagination. And, for Jimmy Fallon, The Monster at the End of the Book, by Jon Stone, continues to be a touchstone on the important subject of bravery. Most of us, at some point in the past, have experienced at least one epic fail. Though such setbacks can feel insurmountable, it’s crucial to pick oneself up and carry on. But it’s even more important to try to learn from failure. For instance, Rick Rubin, who’s produced countless Grammy Award-winning records, is familiar with the fickle finger of success. Masterful albums sometimes flop completely, and mediocre ones sometimes go platinum. The lesson he learned from failure is this: you can’t control how your work will be received. All you can do is stay true to your standards and make it the best you can. Failure can also motivate you to take action and make improvements. After 15 years of getting rejection letters from publisher after publisher, Steven Pressfield felt he’d had enough – so he packed up his typewriter and left New York for Hollywood, where he could focus on improving his craft. In this new environment, Pressfield flourished, selling screenplays like 1993’s Joshua Tree, before moving on to bigger and better things, including the screenplay for Robert Redford’s The Legend of Bagger Vance. In 2005, Leo Babauta felt like a complete failure. He was overweight, in debt and addicted to junk food. That same year, however, he put all his energy into developing healthy habits, a process that he chronicled on Zen Habits, a blog that’s helped more than 25 million people to do the same. But perhaps the best aspect of failing is that it can give you artistic freedom because it removes the burden of expectations. When the Beastie Boys’ second album, Paul’s Boutique, did poorly, the group could take a moment to escape from the public eye and focus on their music. Three years later, they released the artistically and commercially successful Check Your Head. When you fail and live to tell the tale, the fear of failure no longer seems like a threat – and this will make it easier for you to take risks and pursue true innovation. That’s why Grammy Award-winning comedian Patton Oswalt recommends getting that first failure under your belt. Once you’ve failed, you can start growing. When you hear the word “investments,” you might think about the stock market, but an investment can mean much more than what happens on Wall Street. For mentors, the best investment you can make is one that takes your career to the next level. Wired cofounder Kevin Kelly recalls that the first $200 he invested in his first venture taught him far more than he ever learned while pursuing his master’s degree in business. It was also a lot cheaper! That $200 got him an ad in Rolling Stone magazine to promote a travel-guide catalog that didn’t even exist yet. But by bootstrapping, or carefully managing the money that came in because of the ad to spur further growth, he was able to create that catalog and get his foot in the publishing world. Therapist and relationship guru Esther Perel invested in herself by learning nine languages, and now she can communicate fluently with people around the world – and it’s definitely paid off. Sex and relationships are complex subjects, and she’s always able to find the right words. Some of the most rewarding investments can be those made in other people: Jason Fried is CEO for the software company Basecamp, which has made millions facilitating communication and project management services. When he thinks of the most fulfilling moments in his life, it’s the times he gave to friends, with no expectation of ever getting a cent back in return. When one friend was starting up a new gym, he paid for the first year’s rent, no strings attached. However, nothing’s more important than investing in yourself. After she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007, the founder of Huffington Post, Arianna Huffington, decided to take a break and invest in her own well-being. She has no doubt that her future work, not to mention her personal life, benefitted from that decision. Mentors also concur that meditation is one of the best self-investments out there. A small list of those who regularly practice meditation includes Rick Rubin, Jimmy Fallon, the historian Yuval Noah Harari, the Oscar-nominated director David Lynch, chess master Adam Robinson and the investor Ray Dalio. For each of them, meditation provides personal insight, a sense of fulfillment and sharpened focus, and makes it easier to overcome challenges. No matter who you are, there’s always room for improvement, right? Well, the author was particularly curious about the methods mentors use to improve themselves. Both Rick Rubin and the best-selling author and journalist Neil Strauss have found it helpful to build a community of friends around their gym and exercise routine. Strauss says that, since he looks forward to seeing the people he works out with, he’s always motivated and excited about exercising. And Rubin, with the help of a reliable gym community, has lost over a hundred pounds since his peak weight. Others have discovered that improvement is often a case of prioritizing. Jason Fried found a better balance by reducing his workout schedule. He realized that, for him, exercise was turning into yet another habit – one that he was using to justify other bad habits, like eating poorly and not getting enough sleep. So he cut back and is happier for it. Sleeping is something Dr. Brené Brown thinks everyone should prioritize. In her experience, good sleep habits do more to improve your life than whatever diets and exercise plans you may be following. Kevin Kelly has also experienced the benefits of prioritizing. For him, it was about learning how to delegate tasks so that he only has to deal with projects that really require his particular expertise. Another secret to self-improvement is learning how to see things differently. Janna Levin is a professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College, and she used to think of obstacles as something that got in the way of a happy life. But Levin has since adjusted her outlook and found more happiness by recognizing that life is really a series of obstacles that, when approached calmly, offer the chance for you to learn and improve. Bear Grylls, a former member of the British Special Forces and the star of his own Emmy-nominated survival show, realized that life was too short to waste time being fearful about the future or wishing he were somewhere else. Now, whether he’s at home with his feet kicked up or waist-deep in a swamp, he embraces living in the moment. As the Notorious B.I.G. track “Mo Money Mo Problems” affirmed back in the 90’s, “The more money we come across, the more problems we see.'' So the author asked the mentors about their techniques for dealing with the difficulties that come with success. What many agreed on is the need to reset and re-center yourself from time to time. Some mentors, like Jason Fried and five-time weightlifting world champion Aniela Gregorek, do this by taking regular walks. Fried likes to find new areas he’s never been to, since focusing on the new surroundings helps him clear his mind. Gregorek prefers to walk in the forest, and cites the Japanese restorative practice known as “forest bathing.” This involves letting the sounds, smells and cool air of the forest wash over you and refresh your mind and body. Other restorative methods include taking naps, which is the preferred technique of Uber’s chief brand officer, Bozoma Saint John; having sex, a recommendation from People's Choice Award-winning actor Ashton Kutcher; or taking a moment to think of all the things you have to be grateful for, which is how psychologist and best-selling author Dr. Jim Loehr resets himself. But sometimes, when you know you’re already stretched thin, you have to practice the art of saying no. The celebrated authors Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks and Yuval Noah Harari both have people in their lives who help them decline all the incoming requests for speaking engagements. But, of course, we don’t all have the means to employ others to say no for us. When Neil Strauss has to come up with an answer, he now asks himself, “Am I only thinking about saying yes out of fear or guilt?” If this is the case, he’ll then give a polite no. When Kevin Kelly has to make a choice, he imagines that the invitation is for an event taking place tomorrow morning. If he’d still be willing to go, he’ll say yes. However, according to millionaire entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, sometimes saying no, even though you want to, isn’t the best choice. To stay open to life’s many surprises, he’ll say yes 20 percent of the time, even though it might not seem worth it. If there’s one common question that mentors get, it’s something like, “What piece of advice would you give someone who’s just starting out in their career?” When the author brought up this question, many of the mentors said that it’s crucial not to get distracted by fears about the future and instead focus on the now. The social-media guru and trend-setting entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk says it’s all too common for people to worry about where they’ll be in five years while wasting time drinking and watching TV. The truth is, if you make the most of each day, the future will take care of itself. Sure, uncertainty can be scary, but rather than letting it paralyze you, you should take the advice of Zen Habits blogger, Leo Babauta, and use it to spark your motivation and determination. Otherwise, you’re bound to end up procrastinating and missing out on opportunities. So should you start your career by following your passion? According to podcaster and communications advisor Veronica Belmont, employers are likely to admire your ambition if they see you were hard at work on your passion before you even had a job. In a similar vein, legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk believes that true success only comes when you’re living the life you truly love. However, there are mentors who believe a more strategic approach is called for. Kevin Kelly stresses the importance of devoting the necessary time to mastering a skill related to your passion. Once you’ve done this, you’ll likely have your choice of jobs that will pay you to exercise that skill. If you don't know what your passion is, you needn't panic. Yuval Noah Harari reminds us that we're living in a particularly fast-changing world, so your current dream job may not even exist ten or twenty years from now. So it's best to develop your emotional intelligence and work on becoming resilient. This will help you stay strong and balanced in an uncertain future. And once you do settle on a profession, don’t forget to follow Maria Sharapova’s advice and say “please” and “thank you.” No one likes a disrespectful person, regardless of how successful that person might be. We’ve heard a lot of good advice, but maybe you’re curious about the worst advice the mentors have received? Ed Coan, who’s set 71 different weightlifting-related world records, warns people against adopting techniques just because they’re new and trendy. Remember, there’s a good reason to trust the tried and true fundamentals that have stood the test of time. Mark Bell, the founder of the renowned Super Training Gym in Sacramento, reminds people to think twice before trying to take on too much. Like a weightlifter who always tries to lift the most, you can end your career by overdoing it. So focus on working within your zone and what’s optimal for you. Most people would agree that it’s wise to avoid advice that could reduce the quality of your work. When starting out in a creative industry these days, it’s common to be told about how important it is to build hype and grow your brand on social media. But this ranks far below the importance of focusing on your craft, especially when it comes to gaining satisfaction from your work. Hollywood screenwriter Steven Pressfield can attest to how superficial the rewards of social media are. True satisfaction comes from getting deep into your work over a significant period of time. Put in the hours, and the rest should follow. The pioneering cancer researcher Lewis Cantley thinks there’s a trend of bad advice these days. Budding scientists are often warned against sharing their findings until they’ve published it in a scientific journal, but Cantley believes there should be more teamwork and a willingness to share. Such cooperation wouldn’t only make science more fun; it’d likely lead to more progress. However, if you do have teammates, you should always avoid blindly following their lead. Ray Dalio warns against investing in a market just because someone else is. Chances are, that market is being flooded and prices are going up meaning you’ll likely overpay. Similarly, the advice of industry experts isn’t always sound. Scott Belsky, the cofounder of the social-media platform Behance, believes that it’s not experts, but rather outsiders like the people behind Airbnb and Uber who really revolutionize industries by breaking the established rules. At one point, the author asked all the mentors to consider what piece of advice they would give to everyone in the world if given the opportunity. Many of them focused on asking people to be good to one another. The CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, is a committed philanthropist, and he would advise everyone to find out how they can help their local public school. This help needn’t take the form of a donation. It could be asking the school principal if there’s anything you can do to help, like mentoring students by sharing what you do for a living and showing them how they could follow in your footsteps. Even small gestures that only take a couple of hours out of your day can transform a student’s life. Author, philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris would advise everyone to be more reasonable in their dealings with other human beings. Talking and exchanging ideas are the most effective ways to move forward as a species and overcome the challenges that lay ahead. Violence, on the other hand, usually prevents progress. Other mentors urge everyone to make the most of what we’ve been given. Ray Dalio and Scott Belsky remind people to stay open-minded and seek out the less obvious opportunities. While joining a struggling team might not look immediately appealing, it would likely be more rewarding than heading a flourishing one, because there’d be more room for change and surprises. But even opportunities like this aren’t going to magically show up at your doorstep. You have to be ready and open to jump aboard when the time is right. Which brings us to the last piece of advice: if you miss a good opportunity, don’t beat yourself up. Contrary to what you might be feeling, it isn’t the end of the world or of your chances. Remember the words of Leo Babauta: “You are good enough as you are.” As Maria Sharapova puts it, you should strive to be your unique, original self, and no one else. And don’t let the words and actions of other people, or a bunch of “what ifs,” define who you are. Be your own leader, and maybe you’ll become a mentor to the next generation yourself. The key message in this book: There’s more than one way to live a successful and fulfilling life. The advice given by mentors, ranging from reading more and investing in yourself to embracing failure and saying “no” more often, can help you to find inspiration and guidance to help you no matter when you are in your own journey. Actionable advice: Don’t let distractions steal your attention. Your attention is even more valuable than your time – which is why everyone wants a piece of it. So remember to protect your attention and use it wisely. Arianna Huffington regularly “scrambles” the apps on her phone, rearranging their location so that, whenever she starts automatically checking them, she’s forced to pause and notice what she’s doing.

But for many young adults, getting the news that they have been accepted brings along a complex mix of emotions, with feelings of excitement, relief and anxiety all swirling around at once. Some may suddenly start wondering if they’ll be able to thrive in their new surroundings, among new friends, communities and learning environments. But with proper preparation, there will be nothing to worry about – and these blinks are a good place to start. In these blinks, you’ll find out how students today are much less social than previous generations; why physical exercise is the key to success in college; and how there are two different mind-sets you can have – and only one is good for your college years. There’s a popular belief that one of the keys to happiness is to thrive at school and be successful in your endeavors. As we grow up, we’re led to believe that getting into the right college, earning good grades and a spot on the school football team are all steps that bring us closer to happiness. But this isn’t how life works. Earning degrees and acing exams are no guarantees of happiness. Being accepted to a university certainly isn’t a direct precursor to happiness. When a group of college freshmen were asked to rate their emotional well-being on a scale of zero to one hundred, their average score was only 50.7. We’ve also been led to believe that some jobs are a marker of success and are therefore more desirable. Being a lawyer is one such highly-regarded profession, but in one poll of over 800 lawyers, the results showed that they were the least happy of all white-collar professionals and, as a result, drank and smoked more than any of their counterparts from other professions. A better way to think about life is to understand that success doesn’t lead to happiness; rather, happiness will help you find success. Whatever field you hope to thrive in, be it business, finance, the arts, sports or entertainment, happiness and a positive mind-set will increase your chances of success. In 1997, an experiment at Cornell University had three groups of doctors diagnose a case. To lift their spirits, the first group was shown a bag of treats that they could indulge in later, the second group was reminded of how medicine was a humanitarian pursuit and the third group was given no encouragement whatsoever. Both of the groups that had received positive encouragement performed better, diagnosing the case 20 percent faster and more precisely than the group that received no positive priming. This illustrates how positive emotions can help you perform better. So, remember: let happiness into your life and move forward with positivity in mind. This will help you find success and make your dreams come true. College can be a scary place. Not only do you have the pressure of trying to get good grades, but you’re facing a whole campus full of strangers for the first time, which can lead to a lot of social anxiety. This kind of stressful situation can cause a person to retreat into their shell and seek the comfort of isolation. And, sure enough, an increasing amount of college students are doing just that. A 2014 survey of around 150,000 freshmen revealed that today’s students spend less time socializing than any other generation of the past three decades. The results showed that, over the course of a week, 39 percent of the freshmen population spent less than five hours with their friends. By contrast, in 1987, only 18 percent spent that much time alone. One of the primary reasons for this behavior is stress, as 53 percent of the students surveyed reported a tendency to avoid their friends when feeling stressed and miserable. If you hope to thrive in the college environment, you need to fight against the urge to isolate yourself. One of the best ways to relieve stress and help prevent future outbreaks of anxiety is to spend time with friends and nurture your relationships. As it turns out, moments of increased stress are actually the best times to visit friends and socialize. Solid friendships are one of the best defenses we have to maintain a healthy emotional disposition, even in the worst of situations. In one study, researchers found that after examining 800 hurricane survivors, those with solid friendships were four times likelier to avoid post-traumatic stress disorder than survivors without a strong support network. Clearly, you will struggle to thrive if you are sad and stressed out, and isolating yourself from others will only make the problem worse. It’s clear that engaging with others is central to thriving in whatever pursuit you choose, and when you identify your talents and put them to use, it will naturally lead to collaboration with others in your community. If you’re not sure what your talents are, think of any activity that you excel at, or a skill that you’re motivated by and hope to improve. Often, your talent lies in any skill that causes time to fly by when you’re practicing it. This deep engagement with a skill is known as flow, and it’s a sure sign that it is something you should keep practicing. Once you know where your talents lie, let them inform your decisions in college and beyond, and you’ll likely thrive in life. However, it’s also important to understand that things change, and your high school passions and talents can transform in college. Consider what happened to a bright student named John, who had been the captain of the baseball team in high school and highly passionate about the sport. But then, in his first year of college, he lost his motivation and soon stopped playing entirely. Meanwhile, he kept trying hard to succeed in his classes, but wasn’t enjoying them at all either. Luckily, John soon realized that he was letting some vague notion of what it means to be successful direct his life, rather than examining his own interests and talents. After some soul-searching, he was back coaching a children’s baseball team and had shifted the focus of his college courses toward teaching and critical pedagogy. He realized that this was where his talent and skills were – once he had figured it out, he was able to thrive once again. But talent isn’t everything. You should also be sure to awaken your character strengths. Character strengths are things like perseverance, determination and other qualities that keep you moving forward in the face of adversity. For example, when the legendary basketball player Michael Jordan was trying out for his school’s varsity team, he didn’t make the cut the first time around. Although he was heartbroken, he didn’t give up. He simply kept playing and getting better, safe in the knowledge that there’s always next time. It’s important to have the strength to forge ahead in tough times, but to do so this demands the right mind-set. If you’re inflexible and unwilling to change or accept critical feedback, this is a sign you have a fixed mind-set and it’s unlikely that you’ll thrive with this attitude. A fixed mind-set is problematic in college because it makes failure seem permanent: if you didn’t pass the exam today, you feel like you’ll never pass it because you don’t believe in your ability to change or improve. Many students tend to feel judged and unfairly criticized when they receive bad grades or papers filled with red marks – but there’s no need to despair. Instead, a thriving student just needs to adopt a growth mind-set and, rather than focusing on the negative, identify ways to improve. With a growth mind-set, critical feedback isn’t seen as an attack and a bad grade isn’t the end of the world. Instead, they are helpful signs that point to skills that need improvement. Let’s say there are two students, Jocelyn and Peter. While Jocelyn sees a bad grade from a teacher as a personal attack, Peter accepts the feedback as valuable information that will help him improve. Now, which student would you expect to thrive in college? If you’re sensitive to criticism, don’t despair; you can always change your mind-set by acknowledging the benefit of change and taking control of your reactions. Jocelyn recognized that she needed a new mind-set and went to the authors for help. They told her that it was important to view teachers as people who want to help, not judge. Remember, teachers devote their time to providing carefully considered feedback to help students improve. With this in mind, Jocelyn could begin to see feedback as a crucial aspect of her overall learning process. One tip that Jocelyn really found helpful was to say “thank you” when a teacher offered advice. This strengthened her ability to see the teacher as a friend and ally, rather than a judge who is out to make her life miserable. Changing your mind-set will only take you so far if you’re neglecting the rest of your body. To really thrive in college, you need to make sure you’re not sitting in lecture halls or your dorm room all day. A thriving person is someone who stays on the move. Jogging, biking and regular walks are all helpful, so don’t think you need to be running marathons to stay active and healthy. When you’re on the move, your brain produces a protein known as BDNF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This protein interacts with the brain’s frontal lobes, which are responsible for your ability to learn and grow. One school in particular has shown how movement is an important factor in helping students thrive. When Naperville Central High School in the US state of Illinois found their school ranked eighteenth in the world for mathematics and nineteenth in science, the faculty decided they could do even better – and they did this by strengthening their physical education program. They didn’t focus on running faster or jumping higher; they simply made sure that their students spent less time sitting and more time moving and keeping their heart rates up. Sure enough, when the next rankings came in, Naperville Central High was in sixth place for math and number one in science! Even if you think there’s no time in your busy schedule for exercise, with a little creativity, you can surely fit more movement into your routine. Even short, five-minute breaks are great for getting out of your chair and moving around. Whether it’s a quick walk or a round of push-ups, anything that gets the heart going is better than sitting still. Psychologists at the University of Sheffield monitored a group of students who danced during their routine breaks, and they were found to be more happy, energized and creative than students who continued to sit around during breaks. You can also use a standing desk from time to time, so you can do your readings or write essays while on your feet. With some well-placed books and a bit of ingenuity, anyone can build their own. Everyone wants to be excellent at what they do. But to get there, you need to be familiar with deliberate practice. According to the psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, greatness and excellence aren’t a matter of being born with a genetic advantage; rather, they are all about putting in hard work and practicing your craft. Whether you’re a doctor, dancer, musician or business manager, practice makes perfect. But not all practice is equal, and to reap the greatest benefits, you must know how to make the most of the time you invest. This is where deliberate practice comes in. One important aspect of deliberate practice is setting concrete goals, which help you chart your progress and stay motivated. Meredith is someone who dreamed of being the best real estate agent around. She knew she faced stiff competition out there, so she wanted to give herself an advantage by broadening her range of expertise and studying sales, financing, marketing and other useful subjects. So, each month, she focused intently on one subject and practiced deliberately. During her month of studying sales, she read biographies on the best salespeople, sat in on sales meetings and reached out to colleagues for advice. As the months went by, Meredith filled a series of notebooks with the knowledge she had accumulated, and she realized she was reaching her goal of growing and learning. Another way to achieve excellence is to find a mentor and learn from someone who’s already been through it all. Jon dreamed of being an outstanding photographer, and so he became an assistant for the esteemed photographer, Richard Avedon. Jon didn’t expect Avedon to spend his days sitting with him and being a teacher; instead, it was an opportunity for Jon to keenly observe and find out things like which lenses Avedon used for certain situations while also witnessing what it’s really like to run a world-class photography business. It takes a lot of effort to be the best that you can be, but when you’re doing something you love, it’ll be work that you won’t mind doing. The key message in this book: Although college is tough, there are ways you can survive and even thrive in this stressful environment. Remember to focus on your talents and build your character strengths – and don’t neglect physical exercise. With the right attitude and mind-set, you’ll not only make it through your undergraduate years in one piece; you’ll even flourish and put yourself on the path to a fulfilling career.  Actionable advice: Think of a happy memory for 30 seconds. Whenever you’re about to be challenged, whether it’s during your final exams, midterms or a stressful social situation, close your eyes and spend 30 seconds thinking of a cherished, peaceful memory. When you prime your brain in a positive way, it can make any challenge that little bit easier to overcome. It may sound simple, but it really does help. Got feedback?

Young","summary":"Have you always dreamed of speaking fluent French, but dismissed the idea as unrealistic? Would computer programming give you a professional edge if you could only find the time to take a course? Whatever your personal or professional aspirations might be, ultralearning can help you realize them in record time. Ultralearning is an aggressive, self-motivated approach to learning that enables people to quickly and efficiently master difficult skills. By taking this approach to learning, they become ultralearners. Their feats can seem intimidating at first – think along the lines of learning a new language in less than three months. But the truth is that anyone can adopt the ultralearning strategy and see results. These blinks will outline the key principles of ultralearning and give you the specific strategies and techniques you need to start your own ultralearning project and successfully pull it off! Along the way, you’ll discover why all your learning should begin with metalearning; why ultralearners succeed where many educational institutions fail; and what common memorization mistake you’re probably making, and how to fix it. Benny Lewis is a polyglot who takes an average of three months to learn a new language. That makes him an ultralearner: a self-directed learner who can acquire new skills in a short time frame, through adopting an aggressive and strategic learning approach.  Ultralearning projects are self-directed, challenging and time-consuming. Just look at the ultralearning project devised by Eric Barone. Most successful computer games are created by teams of professionals with huge budgets. Barone, an IT graduate working as a theater usher, decided to create one completely on his own. Over five years, Barone refined his game’s mechanics through intensive trial and error. Along the way, he taught himself pixel art, music composition, sound design and story writing.  The finished game, Stardew Valley, was released in 2016. It sold over three million copies that year and landed Barone on Forbes’ ‘30 Under 30’ list. Your ultralearning project might not land you in the pages of Forbes magazine, but it can bring ‘unrealistic’ dreams, like learning French or mastering watercolor painting, within reach. Beyond being a path to personal fulfillment, though, ultralearning can help you hone your professional edge. And staying competitive professionally has never been more urgent.  As medium-skilled jobs are threatened by automation, workers need to adapt, upskill and retrain to stay competitive. In the new professional landscape, the most desirable workers have hybridized skill sets: librarian/data analyst, architect/textile designer, accountant/Mandarin speaker. Ultralearners can diversify their skill sets without taking time off work to pursue further education or qualifications. If ultralearning sounds appealing, you’re probably already wondering how it works. The following blinks will break down the principles of ultralearning, and outline how to implement them in your own ultralearning project. Whether you’re teaching yourself stochastic calculus or perfecting your tennis serve, your ultralearning project should always begin with metalearning: the process of learning how to learn. The idea here is that you shouldn’t start by absorbing information at random. You should first establish how information is structured in your chosen field.  For example, the writing system of Mandarin Chinese isn’t just a bunch of random characters. Instead, the characters are organized by radicals, which are visual markers that express the relationships between those characters. So if you were learning Mandarin, you’d want to start with organizing principles like radicals, rather than just memorizing each character individually.  Metalearning is all about looking for the big picture, then using it to devise your optimal learning strategy. That’s easier said than done, though. Many learners take years to arrive at a big-picture understanding of their subject. Fortunately, there are some simple strategies you can use to create a metalearning shortcut.   First, create a metalearning map by breaking your topic down into three categories: concepts, or what needs to be understood; facts, or what needs to be memorized; and procedures, or what needs to be done. Some projects, like learning a new programming language, will involve a mixture of the three. Working on that tennis serve, however, will mostly involve perfecting a procedure. Focus your energies on the most heavily-weighted categories. Next, use this map to identify which aspects of learning might prove challenging, and then brainstorm techniques for overcoming them. If your breakdown reveals you’ll need to commit a lot of facts to memory, for example, you might consider acquiring spaced-repetition software, which produces randomized memory tests, to optimize the memorization process.  Finally, establish how you’re going to learn. To do this, try benchmarking: research people who’ve acquired a similar skill or institutions that offer accreditation in your field of study. Use these as your benchmark. Replicate their methods and equipment. Use online course lists or syllabi to find the resources, tools and texts that are considered essential in the field. Time invested in metalearning sets your project up for success. As a general rule, allocate 10% of the total time you expect to spend on your project to metalearning.  Through metalearning, you can draw a roadmap for your ultralearning project. Once your map is ready, you should strengthen your powers of focus to make sure you don’t go off-road. We’ll look at how to do this in the next blink.  From constant email notifications on your phone to the temptation to binge the latest Netflix series, modern life is full of distractions. But you don’t have to let these distractions stop you from reaching your ultralearning goals! There are some simple techniques you can use to overcome the challenges of finding your focus. The first challenge to finding your focus? Getting focused in the first place. Trick yourself into getting started by setting a timer for, say, three minutes. Promise yourself that you can stop working when the timer goes off. But at the end of three minutes, you might have found the momentum you need to keep working.  You can build on this strategy with the pomodoro technique: set a timer for 20 minutes and work without stopping during this time. When the timer goes off, take a five-minute break, then get back to work for another 20 minutes. Once you’ve found your focus, the challenge becomes sustaining it. External interruptions can evaporate your concentration. Control your work environment by eliminating them. Put your phone on airplane mode and switch off your Wi-Fi.  The challenges don’t stop when you’ve found your focus, either. Once you’ve started your task, it’s easy to slip into ‘autopilot’ mode. You might feel you’re getting a lot done, but if you’re not fully engaged with your task, you’re less likely to retain new material. Combat autopilot with interleaving: deliberately alternate between materials and modes of learning. Ideally, interleave by tackling your project in short, regularly-spaced sessions. If you have ten hours in your week to devote to Russian, aim for five two-hour sessions rather than one ten-hour session. Focus on a different aspect or skill set, like vocabulary or grammar, in each session. Finally, make the most of your study sessions by paying attention to your mental arousal, or your level of energy and alertness. High arousal generates intense, yet narrow, focus – perfect for repetitive tasks, like practicing musical scales. Low arousal generates a more relaxed and wide-ranging type of focus, best suited to lateral thinking and forming connections, which are necessary for creative tasks such as music composition. Match your arousal level to your task – perform simple tasks when your focus is more aroused and complex tasks when it’s less aroused – for optimal ultralearning results. Honing your focus will ensure you have the mental stamina to complete your ultralearning challenge. In the next blink, we’ll look at how to tackle that challenge as efficiently as possible. Imagine learning French all through high school, then not being able to hold a simple conversation when you take a trip to Paris. It’s a common situation, and it all comes about through a failure to transfer. Transfer is the process of learning something in one context (like a French class), then transferring it to another (like Paris). Despite its importance, formal education often fails to optimize transfer. The problem with formal education is that it sets up an indirect path between the learning context and the target environment – the context in which learned skills and knowledge are actually applied. Rote learning French vocabulary in a high school classroom is a far cry from asking the nearest Parisian how to get to the metro station. Ultralearners know to keep the path between their learning environment and their target environment as direct as possible. By doing this, they cultivate a quality of ultralearning called directness. How do you practice directness in learning? The most direct way to learn something is to do it. The most effective way to learn a language is to speak it. The most effective way to learn coding is to write code. This learning-by-doing approach is called project-based learning. It situates the skill you’re learning directly in your target environment – no transfer necessary!  One of the most extreme but effective modes of project-based learning is immersive learning: total immersion in the target environment. A student of French who decides to spend three months in Paris is deploying an immersive learning approach.  Of course, not everyone has time for immersive learning. Moreover, some skills don’t lend themselves to this approach. There’s a reason that trainee pilots don’t immerse themselves by flying Boeings on their first day of training. Instead, they learn in flight simulators.  If immersive learning isn’t within your reach, use the flight simulator method by replicating the conditions and pressures of your target environment as closely as possible. If you can’t spend three months in France, for example, try a Skype tutorial with a French speaker.  Whatever you’re learning, establish a direct path between your learning context and your target environment. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to drill down and perfect your technique, which we’ll look at in the next blink. What do elite athletes, piano prodigies and successful ultralearners have in common? They all rely on drilling to perfect their techniques and maintain their competitive edge. So, how can you drill strategically to achieve the best results? Crucially, you should never begin your project by drilling. Instead, use the direct-then-drill approach. To do this, start with direct practice, whether you’re writing code or weaving tapestry. Use this direct practice to identify the areas where you wish to drill. After drilling, go back to direct practice until it becomes necessary to drill again. To make the most out of your drilling, apply it to a rate-determining step. In chemistry, the rate-determining step is the part of the process that precipitates a chain reaction; in ultralearning, it’s the step that unlocks the next level of knowledge or opens up the broadest range of applications. For example, you may have a great grasp of the principles of accounting theory, but lack the Excel expertise to put these principles into practice. In that case, learning Excel would be your rate-determining step, so you’d focus your drilling in this area.  How should you design your drills? That depends on the area you want to drill. Can it be easily isolated from the rest of your project? If so, try time-slicing, where you isolate one step in a more involved process and repeat the step until you’ve perfected it. If you want to perfect your golf game, for example, you could time-slice by drilling your drive shot. Or, separate your desired skill into different cognitive components and drill each separately – for example, in language learning, you could drill vocabulary, pronunciation or spelling. If you’re working on a more creative or complex project, you might find it challenging to drill in isolation – it’s hard to drill creative writing, for example. In that case, try the copycat method instead. Choose a piece of work that you admire, whether it’s a painting by Cezanne or a passage by Dickens, and emulate it as closely as you can. Pop quiz! Which ultralearner developed Stardew Valley? Why is transfer so important? What’s the interleaving technique? If you had trouble answering these questions, you may need to work on retrieval. The next blink will tell you how. Learning color theory is a great way to improve your artistic skill and know-how – but only if your hard-won knowledge doesn’t desert you when you’re at your easel. It’s pointless learning new skills, concepts and procedures if you’re unable to retrieve them quickly and efficiently. There are two methods you can use to improve your retrieval rate. But be careful! One of them is far more effective than the other. The first is review: going back over the materials you’ve just studied. The second is recall: trying to recall facts and concepts from memory.  A 2011 study from Purdue University shows recall is far more effective for long-term learning retention, yet most learners opt for review strategies over recall strategies when trying to consolidate their learnings.  There’s a reason we prefer review over recall and it all comes down to a concept called judgment of learning. Essentially, when we’re able to process or understand a concept without difficulty, we judge that we’ve learned that concept. Reading back over something we’ve already learned creates the impression that we’ve grasped this new information. That’s why we gravitate towards passive review strategies: they confirm our perception that we’re learning successfully. But perception isn’t everything. Struggling to recall something in the short term means you’re far more likely to remember it in the long term. Experts call this desirable difficulty – the difficulty posed by recall is ultimately desirable, as it maximizes our chances of retaining what we’ve learned.  Here are some fun ways to make your study sessions more recall-focused.   The first is to test yourself on what you’ve learned using flash cards or, better yet, free recall: after a study session, sit down with a piece of blank paper. Challenge yourself to write down everything you can remember from what you’ve learned, in as much detail as possible. Another approach is to avoid making notes when reading – pose questions that force you to recall the answer. Instead of writing “The Battle of Hastings took place in 1066,” write “When did the Battle of Hastings take place?” Every time you go over your notes, you’ll be forced to recall what you’ve learned. Finally, for a more concrete recall-based challenge, set yourself a task that will test everything you’ve learned in your ultralearning project so far. The advantage to this approach is that you don’t need to waste time recalling general aspects of your subject that don’t apply directly to your intended learning project; rather, you’ll recall specific skills and concepts in a targeted way, as you need to use them. Nailed retrieval? Then it’s time to get on friendly terms with feedback. No matter what level of expertise you’re at, you need to seek out feedback on your progress if you want to improve. Moreover, you need to learn how to distinguish between different levels of feedback and acquire strategies for eliciting feedback. Almost all feedback is useful, but not all feedback is created equal. It’s helpful to divide feedback into three different categories. The first and most basic form of feedback is outcome feedback. This feedback can confirm whether or not you’ve reached a desired outcome. Imagine you’re giving a public talk and the audience applauds at the end. That’s outcome feedback. It can be encouraging, but it’s hard to glean any more information from this type of feedback. Informational feedback gives you more to work with, by alerting you to the fact that you’re doing something wrong. If you give a public talk and audience members walk out at a particular point, they’re giving you informational feedback. This kind of feedback is useful for highlighting problem areas and isolating your mistakes. By far the best kind of feedback is corrective feedback: feedback that tells you what you’re doing wrong and how to fix it. Imagine giving a public talk where there’s a professional speechwriter in the audience, who gives you notes on what went well, what didn’t land and how you can improve. The speechwriter is giving you corrective feedback, and this is far more instructive than outcome feedback.  When sorting through your feedback, focus on corrective feedback over informational feedback, and informational feedback over outcome feedback. How do you ensure you’re receiving enough feedback in the first place? Start by remembering to fail for feedback: if you’re not extending yourself to the point where you fail, you stop yourself from getting useful informational or corrective feedback. Pushing beyond your limits will elicit helpful feedback; acting on that feedback will, in turn, extend your limits. Don’t neglect to seek meta-feedback, either. It’s important to seek feedback on how well your learning methods are working. A simple way to test your learning methods is to track your learning rate – try timing how long it takes you to correctly complete a math problem, for example. If your learning rate isn’t tracking upward, act on this negative feedback by revisiting your learning methods. By eliciting feedback and prioritizing corrective and informational feedback, you can constantly adjust and improve your performance. In 2016, Nigel Richards won the World French Scrabble Championships, despite not speaking French. There are 386,000 French words approved for Scrabble, and Richards committed them to memory. That’s extreme ultralearning! Your ultralearning project might not require so much memorization, but you’ll probably need to memorize some facts, formulas or procedures.  So, how do you learn things so that they ‘stick’?  The most productive strategy you can employ is to settle on a memorization system and incorporate it at regular, closely-spaced stages throughout your project. The key is to use a memorization system that’s both easy to integrate into your project and well-suited to the type of project you’ve decided to tackle. It can be tempting to commit things to memory in one burst. If you do this, you may see short-term results. For long-term retention, though, it’s best to avoid cramming. Make sure you space out your memorization sessions. But don’t space them too far apart – if you leave it too long between memory-building sessions, you’ll start to see diminishing returns. Ideally, make time for memorization a few days per week. If you’re memorizing facts or simple concepts, deploy a Spaced Repetition System (SRS). Try flashcards, which test your knowledge of discrete chunks of information in a randomized way. Alternatively, use SRS software where ‘randomization’ is optimized by an algorithm. For more complex concepts, spaced repetition can be equally effective. Here, your focus should be on regularly repeating key processes rather than recalling information. To do this, switch out the flash cards for a refresher project: test your retention by regularly putting your skills into practice. You could even try overlearning: pushing yourself beyond your skill level. Let’s say you want to nail the basics of algebra. Pushing yourself to learn some intermediate formulas could actually help you retain beginner-level formulas more effectively. A 1991 study from Ohio Wesleyan University demonstrates that extending your learning into a higher skill set not only challenges your abilities, it also improves your retention of lower-level skills. For more procedural projects, the most effective retention method is to simply remember by doing – repeat a procedure enough times and your body will start to automate it.  Now that you’ve learned the key principles of successful ultralearning, it’s time to level up! Start by following your intuition. Physicist Richard Feynman was known for his uncanny intuition; he had the knack of looking at a complex problem and seemingly plucking the solution out of thin air. The technical term for this ability is intuitive expertise, and it can seem rather mysterious to outside observers. But there’s a perfectly rational explanation for Feynman’s flashes of brilliance: his deep understanding of physics enabled him to intuit unexpected connections and patterns. Whatever subject you may be studying, it takes time and patience to build up the level of deep understanding on which intuitive expertise is built. But by employing a few simple strategies, you can accelerate the rate at which you acquire it. Start by getting back to basics. Feynman was famous for asking ‘stupid questions’ and would frustrate his students by bombarding them with questions about basic concepts. However, Feynman knew something his students had yet to learn: it’s possible to progress to complex concepts when you only have a vague understanding of foundational concepts. On the other hand, it’s impossible to become an intuitive expert until you know the foundational concepts of your field inside-out. A challenging learning experience can lead to a deeper grasp of the subject. That’s why you should try and embrace the struggle. Resist taking shortcuts in your learning; if there are two ways to arrive at a solution, choose the longer, more involved one. Learning a few classic chess moves will probably improve your win rate in the short term, but a lengthier study of chess strategy is a better route to a deep understanding of the game.  Try not to give up immediately when things get really challenging. Instead, implement a struggle timer. Force yourself to sit with every challenge or obstacle for at least ten minutes before you look for a simpler solution. Finally, deepen your understanding of core concepts by proving them for yourself. Look at the theorems, ideas and processes that expert practitioners in your field have formulated, then try and prove them or replicate them for yourself. You’re not trying to disprove those practitioners’ work; you’re trying to understand the procedure and thought patterns behind it.  Accepting the truth of ideas just because experts say they’re true gives you a shallow understanding of your subject. To achieve deep knowledge and intuitive expertise, it’s better to work through those ideas for yourself. That way, you’ll become one of those experts! How did Vincent van Gogh go from an art school dropout, whom classmates recalled as an ‘unremarkable’ painter, to the innovative artist who painted masterpieces like Sunflowers and Starry Night? Through sustained, relentless experimentation. Look back over van Gogh’s full oeuvre and you’ll see he didn’t hit on his distinctive aesthetic immediately. Instead, he tirelessly tried different styles and techniques until he mastered his craft. Then, he experimented even more, finally arriving at a unique style. Experimentation is ultralearning’s secret ingredient – the technique can take you from accomplished practitioner to true innovator. But experimentation can seem a little overwhelming at first. If you’re wondering where to begin, one technique you can use is to copy then create: emulate someone else’s work, then use this as a stepping-stone towards testing your own ideas.  Say you’re learning how to cook Korean food. Find a great recipe and follow it exactly, learning its processes and concepts as you go. Once you’ve got a handle on it, you can start to improvise with the process and flavor profile.  Another thing you can do to jumpstart your experimentation is to impose some constraints on it. This might seem counterintuitive, but limiting your creativity can actually help it blossom. That’s because working within strict limits can help you shake off your working habits and force you to try something new. For example, if you’re a budding artist or poet, you might try painting a picture using only shades of green or writing a verse without using the letter ‘e’: you might be surprised by how your creativity flourishes when it’s circumscribed. Finally, aim for the unexpected by hybridizing your materials, techniques or skills to find your hidden superpower. Combining two seemingly disparate elements can lead to great results. Before Scott Adams created the office comic strip Dilbert, he was an engineer with a passion for doodling. He wasn’t the best engineer or artist, but when he found a way to hybridize his unique skill set, he ended up creating one of the world’s best-known comic strips. Experimentation pays off! The key message in these blinks: At first glance, ultralearners can look like outliers. But in reality, anyone can adopt ultralearning’s aggressive, self-directed learning style to master difficult tasks in a short time. Want to successfully complete your own ultralearning project? Start by laying the groundwork: apply metalearning strategies and refine your focus. Optimize your learning by focussing on directness, drilling, retrieval, feedback and retention. To take things to the next level, cultivate intuition and experiment intensively. Actionable advice: Pick the brain of an expert.  Interested in taking on an ultralearning challenge to hone your professional edge? Before you commit to a time-consuming project like teaching yourself the basics of a coding language, make sure it aligns with your career objectives. Find a professional in your ultralearning field and conduct an Expert Interview with them. Ask them what concepts are fundamental to the field, what skills are in demand and which resources they recommend working with. After all, there’s no point learning C++ if you want to break into an area where everyone codes in Python.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Even in today’s supposedly woke world, many women are still playing by the old rules of the patriarchy. These rules tell girls not to venture off the beaten track. They tell women to be thankful for what they’re given and not to ask for more. Worst of all, they tell females that other women are the competition, and they must be in a constant battle for scarce feminine power. Thankfully, Abby Wambach is here to give you some new rules. Drawing on nearly two decades of teamwork and sporting successes with other women, Wambach will show you that, far from being your adversaries, other women are your wolf pack. With them at your side, you can achieve bigger goals, overcome any obstacles in your way and unleash your true potential. In these blinks, you’ll discover why women need to embrace failure; how gratitude can hold women back; and the qualities a great leader really needs. Society likes to remind us that disobedient girls pay a high price for their waywardness. Just consider the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, the young girl who ignores clear instructions to continue along the path and avoid the woods. What happens to her? The Big Bad Wolf, that’s what. The moral of this fairytale is obvious – rules exist to be followed, and little girls shouldn’t get too curious. And yet, as she reflects on her life and career, Abby Wambach can’t see a lot of truth in this old story. In fact, the best things in her life happened when she followed in Little Red Riding Hood’s footsteps and veered off the beaten track. As a teenager, for example, Wambach dated boys. Why? Because it seemed to be what every other girl her age was doing. But something was missing from these early encounters, and during high school, she realized she was gay. Scared of her family’s judgment, Wambach initially hid this part of her identity, even from herself. Toward the end of high school, though, she fell in love and finally embraced her sexuality. This was her first taste of what it meant to step off the beaten path and go against the grain, following her heart rather than the status quo. Wambach’s most cherished role models are women who have chosen their own way in life, too. Indeed, Wambach’s incredible sporting career couldn’t have happened without the trailblazing female soccer players that came before her, who refused to accept the status quo and the idea that soccer was a man’s sport. These were the women who went into battle to bring about Title IX, the federal law dictating that no one, whether male or female, should experience educational discrimination, including on the sports field. It was these women who created leagues for professional women’s soccer and fought for a living wage for professional female soccer players. Given how much of her career and happiness has come about by her and other women’s refusal to do what society tells them to do, or stay on the designated path, Wambach now believes that all women should strive to be less like Little Red Riding Hood, and more like the wolf – powerful, courageous, and hungry for more. When Wambach retired from professional soccer in 2015, ESPN honored her incredible career with an Icon Award at their glamorous awards show, the ESPYS. Standing on the stage that night, Wambach was filled with gratitude toward the sporting world for allowing her to experience this moment. But as she lay in bed that night, her ears still ringing with applause, the gratitude melted away and was replaced with a darker emotion – anger. Wambach’s rage stemmed from a moment earlier in the evening when she had shared the ESPYS stage with two more retiring athletes who also received Icon awards, Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning. As she, Bryant and Manning left the stage, it suddenly struck Wambach that, though all three of them were world-class athletes with equal amounts of grit, commitment and dedication to their sports, there was one inescapable difference between her and them. They were men, and she was a woman, which meant that while they could look forward to a leisurely retirement, she would have to think about her next career move. Bryant and Manning had financial freedom, something rarely afforded to female athletes. Even a brief glance at the numbers highlights the frustrating inequity between male and female sports stars. For instance, the male winners of the 2018 FIFA World Cup collectively took home a staggering $38 million, nineteen times more money than the Women’s World Cup winners were awarded in 2015. This inequality is even more shocking when you consider the fact that the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team brought in over $6 million in revenue, while their male counterparts made less than $2 million. Of course, the gender pay gap isn’t just a problem in sports. It’s an issue for women everywhere. In 2018, American women in every age group and industry made just 81% of their male equivalents’ earnings. What’s the cause of this continuing inequality? Wambach believes that part of the problem is gratitude, that fleeting emotion she experienced on the ESPYS stage that night. Specifically, women are often so overwhelmed with gratitude at just being included, recognized or given a paycheck at all that they’re fearful of asking for more. To close the gender pay gap, women must learn to use their voices and demand equality. As a promising young player on the Youth National team, Wambach was given an exciting peek into her idols’ lives during a tour of the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team locker room. As she tried to take in everything around her, one item stood out – a photograph. Someone had put up an image from the 1995 world cup match between the U.S. Women’s Team and their Norwegian counterparts. But something didn’t make sense. Wambach knew that this was a game that her heroes had lost. Why, she wondered, was a photo of their defeat taking pride of place in their locker room? Five years on, when she joined the national team herself, Wambach finally plucked up the courage to ask about that photograph. The answer she received would change her outlook on failure forever. Veterans on the team told her that although their biggest priority was to win games, that didn’t mean that they were scared of losing them. Far from rejecting the idea of failure, the team was determined to remember every single setback they had endured. Why? Because to these players, failure meant one thing – fuel. Fuel to get out there and prove to themselves that they could come back stronger than ever. Did this strategy work? Well, Wambach’s teammates said the year after they put up that photograph, they won their first gold medal at the Olympics. This story taught Wambach to harness the potential of failure. Unfortunately, many women are never able to do that. They believe they must do everything perfectly, an old expectation imposed by the patriarchy. This means that when women experience failure and realize they aren’t perfect, they lose their nerve. They start to believe they were imposters all along. In contrast, men are more comfortable with their own imperfections and don’t see any reason why they shouldn’t succeed and lead despite them. Just consider the fact that imperfect men have been given permission to rule the world throughout history – from the Roman emperors to every single U.S. president. So, when it comes to failure, take a page out of the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team’s book – or simply do as men have been doing for thousands of years. The most exhilarating moments of any soccer match come when a goal is scored. During her extraordinary career, Wambach has been responsible for many of these moments herself. In fact, in international games alone, she’s scored 184 goals! But if you get a chance to see her score, take a closer look at what she does in the seconds after the ball hits the back of the net. Look carefully, and you’ll see that as her ecstatic teammates run toward her, Wambach is always pointing at them. What’s behind this trademark gesture? Recognition. She’s pointing at the other players in recognition that it was they who made her success possible. That’s the thing about soccer. Even though you might be the one who scored the goal, you couldn’t have done it without the protection of your team’s defenders, the boundless energy of your midfielders or the players on the bench who spurred you on with their tireless cheering. When players celebrate a goal, they’re not really cheering themselves – they’re celebrating their teammates above all else. Of course, in soccer and in life, there are times when it won’t be you who scores. It will be the woman beside you. In these moments, it’s crucial that you start running in her direction, celebrating her achievement. On the field, this sort of behavior is commonplace. But in real life, women can find it harder to praise each other’s successes. Society gives women the message that they are competitors against each other, instead of champions for one another. Women have been told that female power is a scarce resource. Wambach believes that this scarcity is nothing but an illusion. Female power, happiness and achievement aren’t zero-sum games or a cake in which a larger piece for one of us means a smaller piece for the rest. Instead, we should be thinking of female empowerment as an infinite fountain from which we all can drink. Once we realize we have nothing to fear from each other’s success, we can all help each other to drink from this fountain. We can stop fighting each other for that one token chair at the table of patriarchy. Instead, we’ll work together to construct a bigger, better table, with a seat for every one of us. When Wambach was just eighteen years old, she had the chance to test her mettle against one of her heroes. The hero in question was Michelle Akers, one of the world’s greatest soccer players. As luck would have it, Akers needed to get some extra training in, and she agreed to play a match against Wambach’s youth team. By the end of the game, Wambach’s view of herself was permanently changed. Despite the exciting circumstances, the game started in a relaxed fashion, with Akers giving her younger opponents plenty of coaching tips on how to improve their game. However, as the match headed into its final minutes, Akers realized that her own team was three goals down, and in serious danger of losing. That’s when Akers took control. Without a second thought, she screamed at her teammate to give her the ball. Once she had it in her possession, Akers dribbled it confidently down the pitch, effortlessly bypassing Wambach’s whole team, and kicked the ball into the back of their net. Then she did exactly the same thing again. Three more times, until she had won the game. Seeing Akers demand to be passed the ball that day, not just once, but four times, changed Wambach’s outlook forever. Until that match, Wambach had been afraid to showcase her talents. Deep down, she worried that her teammates would resent her for outshining them. Thus, in an effort to be humble and avoid offending anyone, she had only been playing at around three-quarters of her capacity. But then she witnessed Akers demanding the ball. Here was a woman who burned with power and competitive spirit. Here was a player who shamelessly shouted out her desire to win, and who clearly believed she was the woman who could make that win happen. When Akers screamed at the goalie to give her the ball, she was announcing her confidence in her own ability and giving the game her full talent – not just some of it, as Wambach had been doing. Seeing Akers deploy every bit of her power that day freed Wambach to unleash hers, too. Even now, whenever she feels unworthy or incapable of doing something, she thinks back to that game, and Akers’s unabashed determination to win. Sometimes it’s easier to be aggressive than vulnerable. In 2008, the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team knew all about aggression. They were the world’s best team, and the secret of their success was physical dominance. Under Wambach’s co-captaincy, the team unashamedly won games by intimidating and strong-arming their opponents. So imagine the team’s horror when their new coach, Pia Sundhage, produced a guitar during their first training session together, and gently sang a Bob Dylan song to them. What was the rationale behind Pia’s singing session that day? Well, she wanted to show Wambach and her teammates that leadership doesn’t always have to resemble power and dominance. By reaching for her guitar, Pia gave the players an example of an authentic, vulnerable leader who wasn’t afraid to reveal her true personality. Through this eccentric performance, Pia demonstrated that the best leaders don’t imitate society’s ideas of how a leader should behave – they simply strive to be themselves. Interestingly, Pia’s unconventional leadership style led to positive and permanent changes in how the whole team interacted with each other. Before her arrival, the team was run like a dictatorship. Wambach and other senior figures issued instructions, while more junior players had little input into decision-making. But under Pia’s tutelage, the team’s ideas about leadership all began to change. Wambach and the other captains permitted themselves to be more vulnerable and began listening to what others had to say. And the more junior players saw that if Pia could make herself vulnerable and still be a leader, maybe they could also find ways to lead. Gradually, the team’s leadership structure became more democratic. Newbies like Alex Morgan gave Wambach tips on how to play better, players on the bench gave the starting players advice and even the team’s physiotherapists started to make suggestions. Wambach believes that all teams, even beyond sports, can learn a lesson from this shift in how we define leadership. Specifically, we can learn that the best teamwork occurs when leaders aren’t afraid to discard old hierarchies and listen to their followers’ voices. If you’re a leader who’s humble and authentic enough to do this, you may just find that everyone in the team has a valuable contribution to make. After seventeen incredible years of professional soccer, Wambach finally retired. And with retirement came rest. In fact, she gave her body a full three years to recover from decades of physical exertion. When that time was up, she got back into exercise by starting a running program. This should have been easy for a former professional sportswoman, right? Wrong. Every time she ran, Wambach’s whole body ached. After years of doing far more exercise than this, Wambach wondered, why was she suffering so much now? Eventually, her friend Michele hit on the problem. When Wambach pushed herself to the limit on the soccer pitch, she was part of a team of other women who were all doing the same. Physical pain and suffering were part of the job, but hardship was softened by plenty of jokes and words of encouragement shared by teammates. Now she was a lone wolf, without the support and camaraderie of her wolf pack. It’s not just in sports that we need a wolf pack to share tough times with. In fact, women in all walks of life need sisterly support and encouragement. Wambach discussed this need for greater female solidarity in her commencement address to Barnard College, one of America’s most prestigious women’s universities. To her surprise, the speech went viral. Ordinary women reached out to Wambach, saying they were reading her speech to their young daughters at bedtime and telling their girlfriends about it. Some were even hanging wolf pictures in their homes to symbolize the need for more female wolf packs. As one woman who wrote to Wambach poignantly put it, men have always had their clubs, while women tend to feel alone. Whether we’re the token woman in the boardroom, the single mother at the playground or the housewife home alone, we are often isolated. So, how can we start building these wolf packs in our lives? Wambach believes that all you can do when attempting something new is to get out there and try. When it comes to building your wolf pack, this means seeking out women you trust and respect. It’s this philosophy that enabled Wambach and her teammates to win the World Cup in 2015, and to take gold medals in the Olympic Games – not just once, but twice. In fact, running with her pack of fierce and courageous women has rewarded Wambach with an extraordinary career and a lifetime of making her own choices, rather than following other people’s rules. Though you might not lead your wolf pack to sporting fame and glory, you can still gather women together, form unbreakable bonds and agree to go forward in a spirit of sisterhood, connection and joy. The key message in these blinks: Life in a patriarchal world convinces many women that they should color within the lines and never allow themselves to be powerful. But women like Abby Wambach and her teammates have learned to reject these limits by ditching the old rules of female animosity, womanly perfection and staying on the beaten track, and you can, too. Seek out brave, fierce females, and hold them close. Celebrate their wins, reach out for their love and support and show them the full force of your talent and power.  Actionable advice: Captain your own ship. Sometimes life leaves us on the sidelines. Instead of managing that big project at work, you’re stuck at home with the kids. Rather than being promoted, you’re still in the same job you’ve been doing for years. But just because you’re not front and center, this doesn’t mean you can’t be a leader. In fact, there’s ample opportunity for leadership in all of our lives – no matter our role. Whether you’re helping your elderly parent through their illness or cheering on your child as they play their first soccer game, it’s important to remember that leadership isn’t something that someone else gives to you. It’s actually the inherent right of women everywhere to determine their own future and to guide those whom they love. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You need to sit on the lookout for ages, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. As you’ll learn in these blinks, it’s no different for humans. If you want to succeed, you need impeccable timing. This entails the ability to wait patiently for opportunity just as much as the ability to act quickly when it finally comes along. Waiting, even procrastinating, can help you become a better athlete, a savvier stock trader and a more successful marketing executive. What’s more, learning how to slow down will allow you to make better judgments in your personal life. In these blinks, you’ll find out why subliminal messages can make you crave more popcorn; how fast computers contributed to a global financial market crisis; and why a majority of doctors may be racist but not consciously know it. During a gripping tennis match, have you ever stopped to contemplate the ridiculousness of watching two people hit a ball, back and forth? This simple act, nonetheless, is mesmerizing; and it has everything to do with the rhythm and timing of this popular game.  Being a skilled tennis player isn’t just about good eyes and quick reactions. People tend to think that a tennis player’s talent is a product of his ability to rapidly ascertain the speed and trajectory of a ball. But the amount of time it takes for any person to visually register an action is more or less universal – around 200 milliseconds.  Another misconception is that tennis talent is tied to reaction speed – that is, the faster you can react, the better you should play. This is only partially correct. The best tennis players in the world have the ability to wait that essential extra split-second before returning a volley.  Once a player sees that his opponent is serving the ball, he has approximately 300 milliseconds to make a move. Most people move as quickly as they can, only to miss the ball altogether!  Skilled players are different. They can and will wait up to 200 milliseconds, taking in as much visual information as possible, before hitting the ball.  Many popular sports are in fact designed with this timing challenge in mind. If the space between a player and the net was greater, for example, a player would have more time to react. Conversely, if the distance was smaller, a player could only react in a knee-jerk fashion. Tennis is a great example of the human capacity for preconscious preparatory skills. A player has just enough time to pause, letting his unconscious mind formulate the best response but not enough time to consciously plan a move.  This sort of reaction isn’t exclusive to tennis champions, either. Split-second timing plays an essential role in business and finance, too.  Many of the things you do every day are made more efficient with computers. At the extreme end, markets are now dominated by high-frequency trading, the buying and selling of financial products at digital speeds.  High-frequency trading now accounts for 70 percent of all stock transactions in the United States. But even in the fast-paced world of Wall Street, stock traders realized at a certain point that going faster doesn't necessarily mean higher profits.  Let’s look at one example. Early on, the high-frequency trading firm UNX saw its profits rise when it increased the speed of its transactions. To further boost profits, the firm moved its headquarters from California to New York, reducing the distance electronic transactions would have to travel. In doing so, UNX cut transaction times from 65 milliseconds to 30 milliseconds.  Yet the decision came with an unintended side-effect. Suddenly the company’s profits started dropping. Unable to figure out why, the firm decided to return transaction speeds to the slower pace of 65 milliseconds. And as a result, profits also returned to positive levels.  So how can we explain what happened? Yale professor Frank Zhang examined a stock market crash on May 6, 2010 that lasted just 18 minutes but resulted in losses of trillions of dollars. He found that the rapid pace of trading had drastically increased the volatility of the market, leading to extreme swings in the value of financial products.  So it turns out that when trading happens too fast, traders can get caught in wide price swings, potentially leading to serious losses especially in moments of crisis. Yet there is a “sweet” speed, that provides just enough delay for a trader to avoid expensive mistakes.  Knowing this, financial experts are constantly seeking that “sweet” speed to optimize high-frequency trades. Have you ever watched the cult classic, Fight Club? Did you know that the film also has a single frame showing a full-frontal nude male? A shocking move for an American blockbuster, for sure!  While the only way the human eye can consciously “see” such an image is to watch the movie one frame at a time, the image can and does enter our subconscious, if even just for a millisecond. In fact, consumers have been wary of such “subliminal messages” for decades.  In 1957, James Vicary was purported to have flashed subliminal messages on the screen of a New Jersey movie theater using a high-speed tachistoscope, a tool that projects images for a set duration. The images, which flashed too quickly for moviegoers to consciously perceive, supposedly urged them to eat popcorn and drink Coca-Cola.  And guess what? According to Vicary, that theater saw popcorn sales rise by 58 percent and Coca-Cola sales jump by 18 percent. Once Vicary’s experiment went public, however, it caused a big scandal, with the public expressing hostility toward advertising agencies.  Yet later Vicary said he lied about the experiment; decades afterward study after study failed to prove with certainty the effect of subliminal images on human behavior.  Recently, however, new evidence has come to light suggesting that subliminal images can, in fact, produce a long-term effect on human behavior. In 2008, a study found that repeatedly flashing the Apple logo to people without their knowledge increased creativity, more than for those who were subliminally shown the IBM logo.  Even prior to this, another study showed that people who were exposed to messages or words related to old age or aging actually changed their behavior, and began to walk more slowly, perform worse in memory tests and even became more politically conservative! These experiments show that if you want to deliver a message, one strategy is to display it just long enough to have an effect, but still short enough so that people cannot consciously perceive it.  So now we know that timing plays a serious role in how we live and think. Yet how can you use timing to achieve your personal goals? Imagine you’re the captain of a football team. There’s 30 seconds left on the clock, and it’s up to you to make a game-changing decision. In such high-stakes moments, you need to know what you’re doing – and if you’re the captain, you probably do.  Experts don’t need to think before making a decision. In 1985, psychologist Gary Klein interviewed fireground commanders, the people in charge of firefighting operations, to determine how they made decisions in emergency situations.  Their answers were unanimous, in that they said they knew what to do, without deliberation, based on their experience. If a fire had spread, they would focus on rescuing people; if the fire was just beginning to spread, they would direct efforts toward putting it out.  Yet novices can’t trust gut instincts, because they don’t necessarily have them yet. Klein performed another study in which paramedics and medical students watched videos of six people performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  The participants didn’t know that only one of the six people in the videos was an actual paramedic. When asked which person they’d trust most to resuscitate them in an emergency, 90 percent of the paramedics instinctively chose the most qualified person, the paramedic. Yet just 30 percent of the students were able to identify the professional from the rest. Remember that no one can be an expert in every situation. This means when a scenario presents something new, you become a novice and should take your time making decisions.  US Navy Captain William Rogers could quickly discern enemy planes from civilian ones, but only when he had access to information provided by the ship’s controls. On one fateful day in 1988, the ship’s controls failed, and with this, Rogers ceased to function at an expert level.  Under pressure, he made a wrong decision, shooting down a suspicious-looking plane that turned out to be a civilian airliner. His mistake resulted in the deaths of 290 civilians.  If you had to pick out a racist in a crowd, what markers would you look for? Someone with a shaved head, or with racist-themed tattoos, or someone who resembles your doctor? Interestingly, many physicians without consciously realizing it give better care to white people than to black people. Over a hundred scientific studies have confirmed this troubling fact. If a white patient is suffering from chronic kidney failure, for instance, a doctor will be likely to recommend a transplant – the best, most expensive treatment option. The same holds for prescribing thrombolytic drugs to prevent heart attacks. But the same doctors will hesitate to offer equivalent care if the patient is black.  So when judging people, it’s better to question your initial response. While you can certainly make an instantaneous judgment about a person, know that your first impression can prove inaccurate when discerning certain characteristics.  A 2007 study led by psychologist Dana Carney found that when assessing complex human features like sociability and open-mindedness, a person’s estimates are more on point if a person takes at least five minutes to think about it.  Waiting before you make up your mind about someone allows you the chance to change or modify your gut reaction. So while the unconscious racism of doctors might be troubling, the good news is that such patterns can be changed.  In fact, when doctors had their attention drawn to this implicit bias, they started prescribing more medication to their black patients than to their white patients. Have you ever attended a speed-dating event, in which you quickly move from one potential partner to the next? Such methods may be misguided, as experience has shown that taking your time to find love is generally a more successful strategy.  When it comes to finding a partner, instant decisions can work against you. Online dating sites place an emphasis on photos, allowing a user to flip through and rapidly approve or disapprove of a person’s looks. This kind of superficial judgement can be counterproductive.  Irene LaCota, president of the dating service It’s Just Lunch, refuses on principle to let people see photos of a potential match. She thinks the quick reactions people make based on physical appearance are flawed. After all, such assumptions have nothing to do with whether two people are actually compatible.  When it comes to first dates, of course, timing is key. The goal of any first date is to decide whether you want to meet for a second! Thus, you need to get enough information about the other person to be able to trust your instincts. Yet it’s also important to stop before things get too personal, otherwise, you might feel obliged to accept a second date, regardless of how you feel.  So how can you accomplish both goals? By scheduling your first date at lunch. Doing lunch gives you enough time to meet, but keeps things short – after all, you’ve got to get back to work. The hour or so you’ve spent with the person gives you ample material to form a first impression; and now you’ve the freedom to think things over before agreeing to a second meeting.  Sure, sometimes you might want to make a snap decision, but it’s better to wait and think about your choice – even if things take a little longer. While you can decide whether someone is attractive in a heartbeat, it takes time to figure out how you really feel inside. By investing that time, you can increase your chances of finding a partner for life! Do you ever put off a task you hate, like doing your taxes? Of course you do. Here’s why.  Humans aren’t great at comparing short-term and long-term benefits. Psychiatrist George Ainslie found that, when offered a choice between $50 now and $100 in the future, most people chose the $50 up front.  But he also found that the same people would rather receive $100 dollars in six years than $50 in five years – which is essentially the same offer, just five years in the future.  The decision is skewed by short-term benefits in the first instance, but not in the second. And it’s for this same reason that people tend to choose being happy now over being happy later. This is what causes us to postpone things that might diminish our current pleasure, like filing our taxes.  In fact, procrastination is only a bad thing if you falsely discount the future effects of your actions. Not just that, but one benefit of procrastination is that it can make your life better in the short term.  For instance, say you’re driving home from work and hear your engine rattling. Would you stop at a repair shop to check it out, or go home and see if the sound disappears on its own? After a long day at the office, the second choice has profound short-term benefits. You’ll get to return to a warm house, a nourishing meal and a relaxing night.  Furthermore, a little procrastination also helps you think things over before rushing to a decision. For example, in the moment, your only option along the route home might be the most expensive repair shop in town.  However, if you stick to this pattern for too long, it will lead to problems. In this case, your car will eventually break down. Then you’ll have to wait for a tow truck and face a bigger repair bill than if you had addressed the issue earlier.  Do the people you admire the most rush around frantically, or are they composed, persistent and always watching for opportunity? When it comes to the positive side of procrastination, there’s a lot to be learned from successful people. For instance, investor Warren Buffett is a huge proponent of delaying decisions. In fact, for him, a solid investment strategy is to wait patiently.  But that doesn’t mean you should be lazy. In fact, Buffett works hard every day, following financial news and business developments. This means he’s always poised to act whenever the next investment opportunity rears its head.  President Barack Obama also deftly uses delay to his advantage, especially when diplomatically side-stepping tough interview questions. When Osama bin Laden was captured by US forces on May 2, 2011, Obama gave a 35-minute interview to CBS correspondent Steve Kroft.  In what turned out to be a highly dynamic interview, Kroft asked the president out of the blue if this event was the first time he had ordered someone to be killed.  Obama, however, didn’t jump to answer. He bided his time, avoiding the pointed question about illegal government assassinations, and instead carefully composed a statement about sending troops into combat with the awareness that lives would be lost.  So delay can be useful in all aspects of life. These blinks have provided you with the knowledge of experts, showing you how to avoid the mistake of acting too quickly. So wait! The key message in this book: Despite what most of us have been taught, procrastination and delaying action are not necessarily bad. In fact, there are many instances in which taking your time is instrumental to success. That’s because waiting, when used with critical awareness, can help you achieve amazing things.  Actionable advice: Revamp your dating profile. Are you one of those people who is always saying you wish the world was less superficial? Here’s your chance to do something. Remove all the photos from your online dating profiles and write something thoughtful and honest about yourself instead. And if a first date isn’t immediately attractive to you, take the time to listen to what he or she is saying, and think before you write them off.  Got feedback?

But the thing is, our memory betrays us, and we simply cannot remember her name. Perhaps you devise some ingenious way to get it out of her without asking her directly. Or maybe you’ll run into a friend of yours and introduce him to this woman, hoping that she’ll then introduce herself by name! Wouldn’t it be nice to finally put an end to forgetfulness? That’s where these blinks come in. In these blinks, you’ll learn why a pink tuxedo might be a good addition to your memory skills; how you can turn your boring morning commute into a memory bank; and what the sweetest sounding word is. Everyone wants to have excellent memory, right? But considering how many people find it hard to concentrate on details, remembering them just seems out of the question. There are ways to do it, though. Here are some top tips to improve your concentration. First, rid yourself of conflict – that is, anything that leads your mind in different directions and stops you from concentrating. Do you spend time switching between checking your e-mail and sending several messages on your phone? Well, that would make you like just about everyone else. But how do you get rid of internal conflict without doing something drastic like joining a monastery? A good starting point is to stop multitasking. According to neuroscience experts, multitasking actually slows you down by 50 percent and increases your chances of making a mistake by 50 percent. For example, chatting on the phone while driving will lead you to hit the brakes 0.5 seconds slower than normal. If you do the math, at 112 kilometers per hour, your car would need an additional 15.5 meters to come to a complete stop – and a lot can happen in that space, at that speed. Another smart move is to prevent your mind from wandering by giving yourself a purpose. That way, you can easily remind yourself why you wanted to concentrate on something in the first place. In this case, the PIC rule might come in handy: (P)urpose gives you a reason for learning. Take learning a programming language, for example. Your purpose there could be building a website for your family. Once you’ve found a purpose, ask yourself questions so you become (i)nterested and (c)urious about what you’ve chosen to learn. “Is this currently relevant to my life?” or “Can I use this at work?” are great ones to start with. So, now that you know how to improve your concentration, it’s time to discover how to retain information, too. Have you ever read a page of a book and then immediately forgot what you just read? Well, that never has to happen again. An easy way to remember a bit of information is to bring it to life, and this is all about using your creativity to make a memorable movie or picture. When it comes to words, there’s a lot to play around with. They can often be broken down into smaller words which sound similar to others – that way, you can make them more memorable by making them sound funny or absurd. This is great when it comes to memorizing foreign words or capital cities. Say you’re trying to learn “pollo,” the Spanish word for chicken. Picture yourself playing polo while riding on a massive chicken and you’ll never forget it again! Or, let’s take the capital of Australia, Canberra. If you’re trying to remember it, visualize a KANgaroo eating some BERRies to help jog your memory. It takes some practice to think in this way, but it makes the process of remembering things much easier. To make the pictures you’ve imagined super exciting, and therefore more memorable, just use the SEE method. Information always enters our brains via our (s)enses. So, for example, when you’re trying to remember the word “horse,” it’s important to imagine its skin, smell, touch and even its taste. That way, you’ve created a multisensory image that’s far easier to recall than five letters. Up next is (e)xaggeration. Compared to an ordinary horse, you’re more likely to remember a giant bright pink horse wearing a tux, right? Forget logic, it’s all about making funny, fantastical images. And lastly, (e)nergize. A horse galloping at full speed into the sunset is far more entertaining than one standing still in a stable. Adding a bit of action will make the information you’re trying to retain a lot more vivid. The key to remembering information, then, is to use your imagination to bring it to life. Now that you’ve discovered how to create memorable images, it’s important to learn how to organize them in your mind. The best way to do this is to use the loci method, also knows as the route method, which is the practice of combining new information with something already familiar. Humans are experts at remembering specific routes or places (just think about your commute to work), so most memory systems already make use of loci. It works by putting the items to be remembered at specific locations along a route that is already vivid and familiar in our minds. Here’s how you can put the loci method to work: Say you’re trying to memorize bits of a speech you have to give. You would imagine walking around your house along a particular route. The idea here is to create a string of locations to visit as you go. So, in each room you imaginarily venture to, pick three specific locations in the room, and put them in a specific order. In this way, as you go around your house, you combine each part of the speech with the locations you’ve picked. Let’s say you start in the kitchen and the first loci is your favorite pink breakfast bowl. You’d think of the horse in a pink tuxedo from the SEE method in the previous blink and remember that the word “horse” is in the first paragraph of the speech. To make it even more memorable, you could imagine spinning the pink breakfast bowl on its head! Next, let’s say the following paragraph in your speech includes the words “summer camp,” which you remember by imagining your family pictures on the refrigerator. This method is effective because it’ll work with any structured location that you know well. Whether it’s your car, your body or a museum, you can use your route to recall your list. If your route is intentionally structured to hold, say, five objects per room, then you’ll remember both the list and its exact order. And if you’re still not convinced, consider this: the author used this very method to remember the first 10,000 digits of the number π (pi)! It’s always remarkable when a person can easily recall complex mathematical facts or historical dates at the drop of a hat. If you want to be able to do the same, here’s a simple way to remember numbers that only requires three steps. The idea is to transform numbers into images that’ll stick in your mind. First, you’ll need to learn a system that changes numbers into letters or alters how those letters sound. Take the number zero, which can be represented by the letters s, z and c. Tough to remember? Think about a hissing wheel. After all, zero looks like a wheel anyway! Each number from zero to nine can be assigned a group of similar sounding consonants. For instance, the number six can be represented by the sounds j, sh/ch or a soft g. You can also use the shape of the numbers when you assign the sounds to make them easier to remember. For instance, if you flip the numbers two and three on the side they look like the letters N and M respectively and if you flip the number 9 horizontally or vertically, it looks like a p or a b. Vowels are left out for now, but come into use later. The next step in remembering a date or number is to write down the letters that represent them and make up a word. Say you want to remember the year 1969, when humans first walked on the moon. Most memorable dates happened in the last millennia, so you only need to remember the 969 bit. Therefore, the sounds b, sh and p should come to mind. Together, they can be used to make the word BiSHoP. The last stage is to make a picture for you to remember. Using the SEE principle, take the word you’ve created and your chosen date or number. For the above, a bishop dancing on the moon with Neil Armstrong should do the trick! Now that you know how this system can transform numbers into words, it should be simple to create memorable images that you can use to recall particular numbers or dates. Is there anything more embarrassing than forgetting a colleague’s name? Well, when it comes to memorizing this kind of information, just remember the four Cs: concentrate, create, connect and continuous use. If you use this handy system, you’ll never have to deal with this awkward situation again. First and foremost, you’ve got to concentrate on the person’s name if you want to remember and use it. Say the name out loud and then repeat it. If it’s a tricky one, just ask for the spelling. To help the name stick, pick it apart and use any words that come to mind to create a memorable image. Take, for example, the author’s surname: Horsley. To remember his name, you might picture a fight between a HORSe and Bruce LEE. Once you’ve sorted your image, connect it to the person’s face whose name you’re trying to remember. That way, seeing their face will immediately bring up their name. A great way to match a face to a name is to use the connection method. If the person has a striking feature, connect that to the name you’re trying to remember. If your colleague Janice has icy blue eyes, imagine icicles flying out of them! But what happens if you already know someone with that name? This is where the comparison method comes in. The key to this technique is to compare the new face to the one you know. Take two people with the name John. You could imagine both of their heads on one body, chatting to each other about how they look that day. Whichever method you use, make sure you revisit the names you’ve learned so that you use them continuously. It would also be handy to list the names in your diary or add the people whose names you’re trying to remember on your favorite social media channel. You’re now set to remember any information you want. In the final blink, you’ll learn how to make sure it all sticks in your mind. Do you remember much of what you learned at school? According to the author’s research, within two years of finishing school, people can only remember the equivalent of about three weeks’ worth of lessons from 12 years of daily classes. It’s no surprise, then, that without training your memory you’ll forget most of what you’ve learned. To put it simply, all this brain training is pointless without a review process to make it stick. But what’s the most effective way to do this? Each time you revisit what you’ve memorized, the information you’ve absorbed has more of an impact in your mind than it did before. Therefore, to really make sure your brain never forgets what you’ve learned, you should gradually leave more time between one review and the next. After learning something new, you should go over it after one day, then three days, then seven days later and so on. You should return to it two final times after you’ve had a two-month break and again following a subsequent three-month break. Another point to remember is that when you’re going through the process of reviewing, take advantage of the memory techniques you’ve learned. The SEE principle should have provided you with clear, vivid images to bring your information to life. Has the bishop still got moves on the moon? Make sure to use the tools you’ve got, otherwise you’ll lose what you’re trying to retain. It’s always a good idea to stay focused on your main goal, too. If you’re learning a foreign language, booking a trip to that country could be the motivation you need to study extra hard. When it comes to memorizing what you’ve already learned, the key is reviewing what you’ve done to prevent yourself from losing your newfound knowledge. The key message in this book: To make information memorable, you need to bring it to life. The best way to do this is to connect what you learn with what you already know, use your imagination to form memorable images and engage your senses. Finally, by reviewing what you’ve stored in your mind, you’ll make sure it’s never forgotten.  Actionable advice: Get off Facebook! Stay in the present by spending less time on social media apps – you’ll find it much easier to concentrate and learn new information with a clear mind. In no time, you’ll find that by using the memory techniques you’ve learned, you won’t even need to write down your weekly shopping list! Got feedback?

Schwartz and Rebecca Gladding","summary":"Have you ever felt unhappy, stressed out or terrified for no reason whatsoever? Probably: almost all of us, from time to time, experience dark thoughts and worries. As well as being unpleasant, these emotions can cripple us mentally. Many people spend large parts of their lives constantly reacting to unhappy thoughts in their mind. For example, some people experience a crushing terror when they speak in front of an audience; others reject social interaction as their mind tells them they are unworthy of love and affection. If such scenarios resonate with you, then these blinks can help. They show that the dark thoughts in the mind are not “you,” but are false messages from the brain. And because you are not your brain, you don’t have to listen to them. Read on to discover how you can stop yourself from blindly following your brain and discover your true self.   In these blinks you’ll discover the four steps to overpowering your brain; how your brain is wired to make you unhappy; and how you can stop your wandering mind from taking you with it. Do you ever find yourself caught up in things you don’t want to be doing, or feel helpless when you “go” somewhere, emotionally and mentally, that you don’t want to be? We all experience these slips and it results from deceptive brain messages that breed false thoughts or harmful impulses, which lead us astray from our true goals and intentions. Not only that, but deceptive brain messages cause problems such as overthinking and anxiety. Consider one of the authors’ clients. He was a talented Broadway performer when his deceptive brain messages started to coerce him into believing he was unworthy of any good coming to him. Eventually, this led to him suffering from intense stage fright as well as fear of rejection for years. Aside from stemming from his childhood experiences, he was impacted by one specific experience when he was twenty years old: he froze in front of a famous Broadway producer. And since then, his brain had been ignoring his positive qualities and honing in on his imperfections. He paid attention to these discomforting false messages and, as a result, he started avoiding auditions completely — an unhealthy chronic response which only reinforced the messages in his brain that he was no good! But he isn’t defined by these deceitful messages, and you aren’t by yours either. Even though it may appear that we have no choice but to follow what our brain tells us, we must remember our biology isn’t our destiny. You aren’t fated to live a life based on your genes. You actually have the power to break through many of the obstacles you inherit by changing the way your brain works. Why is it that when we know we shouldn’t be doing something, like smoking or binging on ice cream, we keep doing it over and over again? Why do bad habits feel so impossible to quit? It’s because when we act out an unhealthy behavior, it provides us with a sense of relief from distressing sensations, in turn wiring our brain to connect this behavior to a temporary “high,” which strengthens the habit. Note, for example, the authors’ client, an executive who was chronically feeling stressed that everyone around him was always seeking his help and advice. To relieve his stress, he turned to drinking a glass of wine. The trouble was, this resulted in him often downing two or more glasses so that he could continue to feel the relaxing effect. This relief made him crave alcohol each time he felt stressed and then the craving became constant. This very thing happens whenever we pay attention to our brain’s deceptive messages. For example, if the brain sends a message like “I’m not good enough,” and we try to forcefully get rid of the thought by acting out a stress habit — like smoking a cigarette or looking for other people’s reassurance — then we will be hooked on those temporary fixes. That is to say, we “feed the monster” when we respond to false brain messages. We seek temporary alleviation when we train our brain to connect the unhealthy behavior to a feeling of relief. This unhealthy wiring in turn causes distressing sensations. The most disconcerting thing about our brain’s deceptive messages are the physical and emotional sensations that they elicit, which feel very real. For instance, the message “I’m unlovable and disgusting” for some people might result in a potent physical sensation to excessively diet or purge, thereby putting a real strain on their physical health. Every time we nurture the vicious cycle of deceptive brain messages, we make the uncomfortable feelings even more real in the long term. So is there any way of conquering these destructive brain messages? Yes, there is. The good news is we can arm ourselves with self-directed neuroplasticity, meaning we can change how we think by constructively focusing our attention. Neuroplasticity is the ability of our brain regions and connections to adopt new roles and functions. If you take control of this ability, you will be able to have a say in how your brain is wired. Self-directed neuroplasticity involves using focused attention, combined with dedication to follow through on your choices. But how do you do this? By constructively focusing your attention, you are enabling yourself to expose the deceptive messages, rather than believing they represent your real self. When you know how to do this, you are actually reprogramming your brain to work for you, not against you. One woman utilized this phenomenon when she was recovering from a stroke that rendered half of her muscles useless. The people at the rehabilitation facility helped her focus her attention toward identifying the frustrating sensations that came up whenever she wasn’t progressing as quickly as she wanted to. She learned to reign in the deceptive messages that told her to give up by regarding them as false. This empowered her to opt for more positive responses, which pushed her to continue on. Amazingly, brain scans revealed that by focusing on things she valued and disregarding the deceptive brain messages, she rewired her brain so that new brain regions became devoted to moving her body. That is to say, self-directed neuroplasticity changed her brain to enable her to recover from the stroke. This self-directed neuroplasticity is the basis for the author’s Fours Steps Program, as we’ll see in the next blink. Now that you know there’s a way to change your brain’s unhelpful wiring, you’re probably wondering how to get started. Fortunately, there’s a systematic method to help you, called the Four Steps. The Four Steps are a guide to applying self-directed neuroplasticity to your situation, so that you can break the brain circuits linked with unhealthy habits and reinforce those that support healthy actions. Specifically, the Four Steps focus your attention to relabel, reframe, refocus, and revalue the deceptive messages in your brain. It’s important to note that, in the program, you shouldn’t attempt to stop the brain messages from arising as doing so is almost impossible. Instead, the aim of the steps is to teach you how to discount the false brain messages, in order to “focus your attention on things that are genuinely important to you.” When you commit to enlisting the Four Steps, you rewire your brain in line with Hebb’s law and the quantum Zeno effect. The reason we create both good and bad habits – such as learning to walk again after a stroke or learning to drink alcohol when under stress – can be explained by Hebb’s law and the quantum Zeno effect. Hebb’s law posits that when particular brain areas are repeatedly activated by a certain behavior, like breathing deeply when we are upset, a circuit is formed, which we reinforce each time we repeat a similar behavior. The quantum Zeno effect occurs when we, by focusing our attention, hold the activated brain areas in place long enough so that the rewiring can happen. So by using these Four Steps and chronically concentrating on something healthy and helpful, you will eventually create and strengthen new brain circuits. Now, let’s go through the Four Steps one by one. It may seem obvious, but before you can change anything, you first have to know what you want. So the first step in combatting your deceptive brain messages is to identify and relabel them. This step involves developing an awareness of what your brain is doing as it’s doing it, often referred to as cultivating mindfulness. Mindfulness is an experiential process, so you need to put some effort into it and practice it before it can be useful to you. A helpful exercise for developing mindfulness is to find a private place just for yourself and then, while concentrating on your breath, notice when your thoughts drift in and out of your mind, without placing judgment on them. Bring your attention only to the fact that they arise, and as they do, return to your breathing. This exercise will help increase your awareness of thoughts as they come about during your day. Remember, the aim at this stage is to gain an awareness of the process, not the content of the deceptive thoughts — just watch what comes up, without attaching meaning to it. Then, when you’ve pinpointed your deceptive messages, you should label them for what they actually are. Consider an example of someone who often got stuck continually thinking about her future, such as ending up a lonely old woman living in a nursing home. As she dwelled on these thoughts, she’d get all caught up in her overthinking. However, when she started relabeling these moments as “spinning” or “ruminating,” it helped her separate herself from her thoughts for a moment, and she was then able to move on. The most effective way to see your false messages for what they really are is to take “mental notes” of them in one- or two-word statements, such as “worrying” or “mind wandering.” This will help you externalize the messages and understand they are just part of your brain, not youself. Now that you know how to identify and label your deceptive thoughts, how can you change your relationship to them? You can use the method of reframing, which involves altering how important the deceptive thoughts are to you. Take, for example, someone the authors helped. He had recurring thoughts that if he didn’t check certain things at a certain time, something bad would happen to someone important to him. Although he could admit that the thoughts were false, he felt urged to attend to them, as it appeared to be the only way to rid himself of the awful sensations they generated. Fortunately, he learned to resist the impulses to check things when he started relabelling the thoughts as “false foreign invaders.” He also was able to reframe them in order to perceive them as part of his unhelpful brain wiring. The aim of reframing is to understand that false brain messages are separate from the real you. Knowing this places a buffer between the messages and automatically engaging in detrimental behavior. You can also reframe by using phrases such as “it’s not me; it’s just my brain” or by picking up on your thinking errors. One common thinking error is all-or-nothing (black-or-white) thinking, which involves classifying information in extremes, such as calling a situation “perfect” or “ruined.” One of the authors’ clients, used this thinking error to inform her actions, which meant that if she wasn’t able to do something perfectly, she was unlikely to try doing it at all. Another common error is catastrophizing, which means blowing your current experiences out of proportion or predicting that something bad is going to happen. People who over-analyze and engage in “what-if” thinking fall prey to catastrophizing a lot. Reframing will help you recognizing these errors and you’ll find solace that they aren’t real; they are merely a little part your brain. Like most of us, your attention is probably easily caught by a variety of deceptive thoughts and impulses which cause you to become trapped in repetitive cycles of unhealthy behavior, such as overeating and over-thinking. The third step — refocusing — can be used to alleviate these destructive attention grabbers and it entails focusing your attention on a productive activity. The purpose of refocusing is to build up your assurance that, through experience, you can continue with your day despite the presence of deceptive thoughts and impulses. To refocus, you’ll need to choose a constructive, helpful behavior that maintains your attention. However, since it’s pretty challenging to think up ways of refocusing when you’re right in the middle of dealing with deceptive brain messages, it’s best to jot down a list of refocus activities before the false messages crop up. Some examples of engaging and helpful activities might be to go for a “mindful” walk by concentrating on your footsteps, the scenery and environment; doing a short workout, reading, or calling a friend. Make sure you write down plenty of activities so that you have a go-to list when you need it. You should refocus even while the deceptive thoughts are happening. Many people falsely think that to refocus means to distract yourself from the deceptive thoughts to escape them or remove them. Instead, it’s about managing your responses to the distressing thoughts and feelings and allowing them to be present. If you try to force the thoughts and sensations to go away, you’re feeding them attention, strengthening that response into your brain; whereas, if you let them be and choose healthy activities, your mind will naturally refocus. Although your deceptive messages will try to convince you otherwise, you need to change your beliefs about yourself  — not yourself — in order to rewire your brain for healthy, loving thinking. Revaluing is the fourth and final step in reprogramming your brain, and it involves looking at situations from the wider perspective of your healthy and loving side, instead of from the limited, negative perspective of your deceptive brain messages. Revaluing requires you to understand that you’ve been experiencing your life from the narrow point of view of the deceptive brain messages. Take another of the authors’ clients, for example, whose life was controlled by her perfectionism until she learned how to revalue what she experienced. While challenging her flawed thoughts and refusing to give in to her impulses toward perfectionistic behavior, she began to notice how restricted her life had become. She noticed that constantly checking to see if she’d slipped up or upset someone had actually become a real obstacle in her life, as it often prevented her from taking action. Essentially, revaluing is deciding to view your life with a positive, compassionate mindset. Another important tenet of revaluing is to learn how to care for yourself so you can make decisions from a stable, loving place, rather than from fear, anger, sadness or other deceptive emotions. The client above, for instance, learned to deal with her inhibiting perfectionism by asking herself what she would say to comfort a friend. Doing that helped her look at the situation from another person’s caring and compassionate perspective and to revalue the situation from that point of view. The key message in this book: Your brain gives false, destructive messages, that trigger detrimental patterns and habits. But you have the ability to reshape this brain wiring. The Four Steps of relabeling, reframing, refocusing and revaluing allow you to break down the associations between unhealthy thoughts and habits. Actionable advice: The next time you feel the urge to procrastinate, go through the Four Steps. (1) Relabel by saying what’s happening: e.g., “I’m having the urge to go on Facebook.” (2) Reframe by reminding yourself why it’s troubling you: “Checking Facebook reduces my anxiety that I might not be able to complete the work I should be doing.” (3) Refocus by doing something productive like beginning the easiest work task. (4) Revalue by recognizing that this impulse to procrastinate is just a deceptive brain message, and needn’t be taken seriously. Keep a notebook of healthy activities. In order to work through the Four Steps effectively, why not keep a little book of healthy, productive or fun refocusing activities? This way, you’ll never be short of activities to distract you when a deceptive brain message pops up.

Womack","summary":"Have you ever stopped to think if your working day is as effective as it can be? Are you really doing all that you can do? Chances are you aren’t. Truth is, we are all suffering from a distinct lack of efficiency in our daily lives. For a start, just think about how much time you spend every day being interrupted by colleagues. It might seem trivial to talk about the game last night with a workmate, but do that half a dozen times and you’ve lost an hour. We are far from working at our full potential, but what can we do about it? Luckily these blinks have the answers. Read on and you will discover how to start working toward your full potential. In these blinks you’ll discover why life is a marathon not a sprint; why you should evaluate the people you work with; and how to stay motivated at every stage. Just Do It – you’re probably familiar with this catchy Nike tagline. But have you ever considered that those three words could be much more than an ad campaign? Just Do It is one of the simplest yet most valuable pieces of advice for anyone who wants to achieve any kind of goal. Read the slogan again, and this time think – what does the It mean for you? Defining exactly what you want to do will jumpstart your journey toward working smarter. Setting a clear goal takes self-honesty, which you can achieve just by standing in front of your mirror in the morning and asking yourself the following question: “If I could be better at one thing, what would that be?” Then, when you get home at the end of the day, return to the mirror and ask yourself another question: “What did I do today to bring myself closer to achieving my goal?” Let’s say your goal is to run a marathon. Did you go jogging? Take steps toward a healthier diet? This leads us to another vital aspect of setting your goals: breaking them down into smaller parts. For instance, your marathon dream may seem daunting. Why not break up your training into smaller units? You could start with 5 km, then move to 10 km, and work your way up. If you can turn your seemingly huge goal into a series of manageable tasks, taking action becomes so much easier. It’s also important that you approach your tasks one at a time. Though it’s great to be excited about achieving your goals, always be careful not to get ahead of yourself. If you’re anticipating doing too many things at once, you’ll find your energy and motivation draining away. This applies not just to tasks related to your goals, but to other distractions too. Read on to find out how you can combat this and make the most effective use of your time! What tasks did you put off today? We all postpone things on our to-do lists, promising we’ll come back to them as soon as we have a little more time, while the list only grows longer and longer. This will set you back as you chase your goals, but you can combat it by keeping good pace.  So how do you find a good pace? It’s all about balance: you shouldn’t move so fast that you run out of steam before the day’s over, nor should you go so slow that you lose motivation. If you can find the middle ground that you’re happy with, then you’ll have found your pace. And, once you’ve found it, stick to it! The author had to learn the lesson of sticking to his pace the hard way. An avid triathlete, he was running in the Wildflower Triathlon and found that he’d completed the first mile in just six minutes, though his planned pace was eight minutes per mile. Sure enough, by the five mile mark he hit the wall and had to slow down. This wouldn’t have happened if he’d kept to his pace! Keeping pace is one way to use your day more effectively. But there’s another way to make the most of the time you have. How? Simple – by valuing it! Consider this: 15 minutes is around one percent of a day. Still, it’s enough time to get a lot of things done. When the author had to wait 15 minutes for a meeting, he managed to write a thank you card, review his calendar for the coming three weeks, book his hotel and rental car for an upcoming trip, check his voicemails and briefly plan out an article. Think about that the next time you’ve got 15 minutes to spare. Inconvenient waiting times can turn into windows of opportunity to tick those little items off our to-do lists. This in turn will free up mental space for more important tasks, which is vital, as we’ll see in the following blink. You know that feeling when you’re reading a book, find your mind wandering and suddenly reach the bottom of the page with no clue about what you’ve just read? Distractions are seemingly ever-present! But if we want to get through that book, or move closer to our goals, we’ve got to fight them. Distractions often weigh upon us and keep us from focusing on the present moment, sometimes more than we realize. Once, a new executive coaching client asked the author “Where do we begin?” He responded by placing a ream of paper in front of her and asking her to write down one thing that she was thinking of on the first sheet. Then he asked her to put the sheet aside and write down the next thing she was thinking about on the following page, and so on. Nearly all of the things she wrote down were tasks she had to do, from hiring a new employee to organizing a summer camp for her daughter. After four hours, she had identified 500 things that required her attention! It’s easy to see how having so many uncompleted tasks would drain your energy and draw you away from your goals. Ticking those distractions off your to-do list is a crucial step toward working smarter. But it’s not just errands that can distract you from your goals – people can too. How much time do you spend with people that limit your thinking? Try writing a daily assessment of the people you spent the most time with and how they affected your productivity and engagement. After a couple of days you’ll see which people truly inspire you. These are the people you should try and spend at least an hour or two with each week or month. This will keep you both motivated and open-minded. We can do our best to complete everything on our to-do list, but there are still ways that we’re losing time without even realizing it. How often do you have to interrupt your work to chat to colleagues during the day, for example? Over time these interruptions add up. So how can we manage them? By tracking them, measuring them, and making a change. One of the author’s clients measured how many times he’d been interrupted by a colleague over two days: 27 times! You can imagine how this must have damaged his productivity. Having measured and realized how much time was being wasted, the client knew he had to do something about it. Try measuring your lost time for yourself, for example, by how much time you spend away from your desk, or how many times someone asks “for a minute.” You may be shocked at what you find! Keeping track of your productivity on an everyday basis is incredibly helpful, but it can’t stand alone. It’s also important that you continue to know why you do the things you do. Keep asking yourself what your true purpose is – this will keep you on the right track. A great way to evaluate your sense of purpose is by formulating some “So that...” statements. It could be things like “I work so that I can send my children to college.” You can keep these statements somewhere you’ll see them every day, to keep you inspired to achieve the things that matter. Despite what we might think, nobody can truly change all by themselves. Luckily, the world is full of people who have different perspectives that you can learn from as you work toward your goals. All you have do is ask! But first, consider the last time someone offered you constructive criticism. Was it from your boss? Your spouse? What exactly did they say? If you can’t remember, it’s probably a sign that you should listen more carefully. One way you can improve your listening skills is by seeking feedback more often, and seeking it actively. Don’t just wait for it! A great way to gain more feedback is by creating a mentor/mentee program. This is how it works: Think of someone you think could meet for weekly sessions over the next two months. During these meetings explain your current projects to your partner, listen to their feedback, and then listen to their projects and offer them feedback in turn. Feedback is a great way to ensure you’re constantly improving. But if you’re serious about growing, you’ve got to make sure you never rest on your laurels, no matter how tempting it may be! Once we’ve settled into a job or done something for a long time, we tend to get comfortable and assume we know the best way to complete our tasks. But if you want to achieve more, never let yourself get comfortable – instead, keep practicing! One way to do this is by adopting the mind-set of a beginner. Take the author’s mentor, Jim Polk, for example. Even though he’s a seasoned pilot with hundreds of flying hours, he still practises the basic lessons he did when he first learned how to fly.   The key message in this book: Setting clear goals, eliminating distractions and valuing your time will allow you to work smarter. Your ambitions will never be out of reach when you keep your focus on them and surround yourself with people who inspire you.  Actionable advice: Make the most of your waiting time!  If you’ve got a few minutes to spare, try writing a short thank-you card to a colleague, or anyone who has helped you out lately. Not only will this keep you productive, it’ll also help you focus on the present and the things that you’re thankful for – a better energy boost than any cup of coffee! So make sure you always have some postcards and stamps with you, just in case. What to read next: The Effective Executive, by Peter F.
