[{"title":"The Next Decade","author":"George Friedman","summary":"World history is full of the chronicles of dominant empires: Rome, China, Spain and Great Britain, to name just a few, have all changed the course of history, and each has had an immense and lasting geopolitical impact. Since the fall of the USSR, a new empire with far-reaching influence has emerged: the United States. But unlike past empires, the United States didn’t attain its position by colonizing much of the world – it is an unintended empire. Even so, this unintended empire’s geopolitical decisions are still centered on its own security and broader interests. For a clearer idea of where the world might be in the next decade, one must look at this decade’s international geopolitics from the perspective of the United States. In these blinks, you’ll learn why Iran is the key to US policies in the Middle East; why Pakistan, not Afghanistan, should be a country of focus for the United States; and why Turkey will become an important ally for the United States in the near future. As the United States consolidates its influence over the rest of the world, it now faces the same challenge that ancient Rome once dealt with: maintaining an empire without relinquishing the republic. The United States wields power that is disproportionate to its geographic size and population. The country’s military, for example, remains unchallenged by any other, and its economy produces more than three times that of its closest competitor. This unique status as the world’s major superpower brings particular dangers, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001, which targeted the United States as a symbol of geopolitical domination. To achieve its future goals, the United States will rely heavily on one person: the country’s president. The president of the United States is the most powerful political leader in the world, one whose decisions regarding war, peace and economics reverberate across the globe and affect billions of lives. The invasion of Iraq, for example, has shaken the entire Middle East to its core for the past ten years, and has also resulted in the waves of refugees now seeking safety and security in nearby Europe. Dealing with the realities of empire management doesn’t leave room for the president to exercise virtue. To protect American interests, the president will need to adopt an unsentimental approach: identify the most dangerous enemies, build necessary coalitions and manage them. Ultimately, this will mean abandoning old alliances, such as NATO, the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, and following the pragmatic example of past leaders who ruthlessly protected American interests. For example, former President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped defeat the Third Reich during World War II by forming an alliance with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, despite the latter’s totalitarian rule and ruthless policies toward his own people. In the past decade, two massive events have occurred that will shape how our near future unfolds: the financial crisis of 2008 and the response of US President George W. Bush to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. The financial crisis of 2008 was the biggest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression. Even so, similar economic downturns that took place since World War II offer some insights into the ways these events can be properly managed. The first was during the 1970s when, due in large part to the oil crisis of 1973 and languishing industrial production, the market for municipal bonds was on the verge of collapse. In fact, the City of New York almost defaulted on its debt. During the same period, third-world countries also needed financial assistance in the form of major bailouts, in this case provided by international organizations. Then, in the 1980s, savings-and-loan institutions took the serious risk of venturing into the real estate market, only to cause an economic disaster that had to be rectified by the US federal government. So what can we learn from these crashes? Well, they each demonstrated that the real remedy to economic crisis isn’t economic policy, but rather public perception. A president doesn’t have to actually solve problems on his own; he simply needs to convince the public that he indeed has a plan. That plan, if he is an efficient president, will be to shift the boundary between private and public, between market and state. And that’s exactly what Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the 1930s. He dramatically increased the power of the federal government and shifted power from the financial elite to the political elite. In doing so, he mollified the widespread public sentiment that elites had failed society – just the type of sentiment that led to the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany. These examples demonstrate that the most significant consequences of the 2008 crisis will be political, not economic. The coming years will see a rise of economic nationalism: the growth of the state will result in reduced market autonomy and will put geopolitics firmly in the hands of politicians. The United States was at war for only 17 percent of the entire twentieth century. In the twenty-first century, however, it has been at war perpetually. So why did the United States end up in this situation, and what must it do to change it? Before September 11th, US policy in the Middle East followed the old strategy of balancing power to maintain the status quo. The United States’ major interest in the Middle East has long been the Arabian Peninsula and the protection of its oil reserves. The United States followed the same strategy for decades to keep the oil flowing: encourage rivalry between local players in order to prevent any one of them from dominating the region. For example, the United States pitted Iran and Iraq against each other to neutralize their respective threats for several years. But after September 11th, President George W. Bush made a grave mistake by abandoning this successful strategy. Instead of accepting the casualties of September 11th and simply moving on, Bush declared a “war on terror,” even though terrorism didn’t and doesn’t represent a substantive threat against the security of the United States. The foreign policy of a war on terror was and continues to be disproportional to the threat posed to the United States, and such an imbalance actually creates windows of opportunity for other enemies. Consequently, the United States now finds itself in an impossible situation: how can it withdraw troops from Iraq without leaving Iran unchallenged in the region? George W. Bush made a serious miscalculation in Iraq. By supporting Iraqi Shiites in their ascent to power after removal of dictator Saddam Hussein, he essentially helped create a pro-Iranian government. Now, the only way for the United States to provide a military counterbalance to Iran involves keeping troops deployed in the region, thus trapping its forces there for the long term and weakening its other positions throughout the world. To deal with this situation properly, the United States must completely rethink its policy in the Middle East. The US invasion of Iraq had an enormous impact on the balance of power between Iran and Iraq. The withdrawal of American forces has changed this balance yet again. Iran is a force to be reckoned with, in part due to its relatively large population. Its neighbor Iraq has a population of only 30 million; in Saudi Arabia it’s 27 million. Iran, however, boasts a population of 70 million. Its population, combined with its religious affiliation, give it significant power. Islam’s two major sectarian groups, Sunni and Shiite, have clashed for centuries. Iran is a Shiite nation, as is Iraq. Their combined power outweighs that of any Sunni country in the region. In addition to its population, Iran is also ideally located, with mountainous borders that make the country a veritable fortress. Indeed, Iran is a formidable country, but that hasn’t stopped the United States from attempting to destabilize successive Iranian regimes. Over the years, the United States has made many such attempts, all of which inevitably failed. An attack on Iran, such as the one recently suggested by Israel over Iranian nuclear facilities, would only make Iran more dangerous than it already is. In all likelihood, Iran would simply counter by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, through which 45 percent of all oil-exporting tankers travel. This move would cause oil prices to soar, severely damaging the global economy. Now, with its neighbor Iraq effectively neutralized, Iran enjoys a secure position safe from direct invasions. So, where does that leave the relationship between the United States and Iran? Despite their antagonistic relationship, a truce – even a reluctant one – seems inevitable. In fact, Iran has every reason to reach such an agreement. It considers the United States to be unpredictable and dangerous, particularly as it has been Iran’s greatest enemy over the past decades. At the same time, the United States is at war with various Sunni-affiliated terrorist groups, which also happen to be Iran’s enemies. The United States has no intention of leaving Iran completely free to maneuver in the Middle East – at least not without throwing a wrench in the works. Within a few years, the United States will have to readjust the balance of power in the Middle East, and the only US-friendly regional power for this task in the long run is Turkey. With a population of about 70 million and the seventeenth largest economy in the world, Turkey has already achieved a dominant status in the Middle East. Adding to their clout, Turkey has the strongest army in the region and one of the strongest in Europe. Iran’s domination of the Arabian Peninsula is not in Turkey’s interest. Simply put, Turkey doesn’t want to see Iran grow to become more powerful than it is and take a position of leadership in the area. Moreover, Turkey has its eyes on the region’s oil and intends to reduce its dependency on Russian energy imports by increasing its regional influence. But how do Turkey’s neighbors feel about its ambitions? The Arab world will back Turkey, both because it is a Sunni Muslim country and because an alliance with Turkey is the best way to stay safe. The more power Iran has, the worse off the Sunnis of the Arabian Peninsula are. As Iran gains power, the Sunnis’ historical partner, the United States, will slowly lose interest in offering protection as its dependency on Arabian oil lessens. The Sunnis have no other option than to back Turkey. In the long run, Iran will not be able to curb Turkey’s ascension to power. Economically, Turkey is more dynamic than Iran and also controls a stronger army. The United States will also help Turkey in its rise to power, as they see Turkey as a potential partner to stabilize the region in a way that best suits their interests. The region between the eastern Mediterranean and the Hindu Kush is a clear focus of US foreign policy: maintaining the regional balance of power, preserving the flow of oil and eliminating Islamist groups are the main goals the United States is pursuing in the region. Though the United States was very active in Afghanistan for some time, the country is strategically secondary to neighboring Pakistan in achieving the United States’ goals in the region. For one, the government currently forming in Afghanistan poses no serious threat to the United States; the issue the United States should really be concerned with is the balance of power between Pakistan and India. Since their independence, these two countries – both nuclear powers – have had a tense relationship. This static opposition is exactly what helps the United States maintain a favorable balance of power in the region. However, if India assumes a dominant position over Pakistan, the balance could be upset. Therefore, the United States should spend the coming decade helping Pakistan to consolidate its power and to build a more sophisticated army that can keep up with India. To accomplish this, the United States will need to end its war in Afghanistan and thus relieve some pressure on neighboring Pakistan, which has been indirectly sucked into the conflict. Restoring Pakistan as a counterbalance to Indian power will simultaneously reinvigorate Pakistan as a force against Afghanistan too. For the United States, it’s a win-win situation. In the end, the US intervention in Afghanistan will prove to have been useless, as it was unable to accomplish the stated goal of wiping out the Taliban. Jihadist forces, anchored in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, will likely re-emerge regardless of whether the American troops stay in the region or withdraw. The war in Afghanistan will end just as the Vietnam war did: with a negotiated peace agreement involving insurgent forces, who will then simply take control of the country. When the Soviet Union fell in the early 1990s, many stopped thinking of Russia as an international player. But looking at Russia’s position in world politics today, it seems these commentators spoke too soon. When he took office in 2000, Vladimir Putin began emphasizing Russia’s dependence on a strong state. He started restoring Russian power on the international stage by rebuilding the Russian army and flexing the country’s military muscle. In addition, he adjusted the Russian economy with an emphasis on exporting natural resources. Generally, his strategy has been successful over the last decade, but Russia will need to find a new path to succeed in the future. Putin’s focus on energy production and natural resources never really took off, and certainly didn’t become the solid base for a modern economy that he’d hoped for. All in all, Russia remains a weak country that needs strategic alliances with the West in order to strengthen its position. Take their relationship with Germany, for example. Russia needs the technology that Germany produces, and Germany needs the natural gas Russia supplies. This is a relationship that Russia intends to build on, playing on the rift that has opened between Europe and the United States following the US-led War on Terror in response to 9/11. While Russia’s expansion doesn’t jeopardize America’s interests, a collaboration between Europe and Russia certainly could. In Eurasia, as everywhere else, the United States has a singular goal: preventing the rise of a local power that could develop into a global challenger. To prevent the collaboration between Russia and Europe from succeeding, the United States must block a German-Russian entente and push back Russia’s sphere of influence. Poland is the most strategic and ideally located country to serve as a proxy for these goals. Situated between Germany and Russia, it also has a long, tragic history with both, and would rather align itself with US interests than see a Russian-German partnership develop. In the coming years, we’ll likely see the United States grow closer to Poland, most notably through technology transfers and by supporting the local government’s attempts to discredit Russia. Over the coming years, geopolitical tensions are likely to become more severe within European countries, thus making the future of the European Union uncertain. Specifically, the European Union faces two problems in the years ahead. The first is the kind of relationship it wants to develop with a resurgent Russia. The second is determining how Germany, the most dynamic of European economies, should be situated within the Union. It all boils down to one simple question: will the geopolitical logic that led to two world wars come to the fore? These two world wars followed the same pattern: Germany, in a powerful but insecure position due to its being surrounded by nations with divergent interests, launched a lightning attack against its strongest rival, France. Germany emerged from the 2008 economic crisis relatively unharmed, thus creating an imbalance with its neighbors and isolating the country. The consequences of the 2008 meltdown have highlighted how far Europe is from being a single and united geopolitical force. Germany, which seemed to be the prime decision maker in Europe during and after the crisis, opposed bailout measures for weaker countries; it thus seems the unity of the European Union is less solid than initially thought. This also highlights the reality that Europe’s historical integration was imposed primarily by the necessity of organizing against the Soviet threat. The confederate model for European organization and integration hasn’t evolved into a deeper sense of unity over time. Even today, each constituent nation-state chooses whether to adopt the Euro as its currency, clings to its own history and identity and refuses to commit to a united defense policy. In service of its imperial interests, US policy over the next decade should play on this dischord to hinder any European-Russian rapprochement. This will mean splitting the Franco-German bloc, thereby limiting the power of a potential European-Russian ensemble and weakening a Russian-German entente. Ultimately, though the EU will not disappear, the coming years will see some members stepping out of the eurozone. And without united military forces, the EU will never attain any real power. The key message in this book: After two world wars left Europe in ruins, the United States emerged as the world’s new superpower. Understanding how such an empire is managed effectively will shed light on the way events will play out across the globe in the next decade – in any region where the United States has a vested interest.

El-Erian","summary":"Since the 2008 financial crisis, politicians have failed to find any means to foster economic growth. Instead, they turned to central banks – the institutions that oversee monetary systems – and made those institutions solely responsible for creating growth. Somehow central banks have become the “only game in town” when it comes to making the economy prosper again. These blinks explore the significant role of central banks in the world economy and take you through some of the disconcerting developments that can be understood by looking at the responsibilities of central banks. You’ll also learn why the European Central Bank charges people to put their money in the bank; how central banks have widened the income inequality gap; and why structural reforms need to be prioritized. Few people paid attention to the role central banks played in the global economy before the financial crisis of 2008. Even today, most people only have a loose understanding of what they are. In layman’s terms, they’re state-owned institutions that manage a nation’s money supply. Central banks have gone through some dramatic changes in recent years, however, and now possess a lot more power and responsibility. In addition to printing money and managing the currency in circulation, central banks are now tasked with fostering economic growth and employment. They’re also responsible for ensuring financial stability by monitoring the banking industry. Consider the Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, which serves as the central bank of the United States. It oversees the nation’s financial system by supervising and regulating banks. Because of the problems caused by the 2008 financial crisis, central banks have been forced to venture into potentially dangerous new economic waters. When the US housing market started to collapse in 2008, some central bankers had to interfere by leveraging monetary policies that had never been used before. In June of 2014, for example, the European Central Bank pushed the interest rate on bank deposits into the negatives: an unprecedented move in times of economic stability. Depositors were thus paying to store their money in the bank rather than earning interest from doing so. The move was aimed at boosting the economy by incentivizing people to spend more. Instead, it just hurt people who were saving their money by taking it away from them. The full repercussions of this policy remain to be seen. Where have these changes been leading us? What effects will they have in the long run? Central banks managed to restore calm to financial markets after the 2008 crisis, but they failed to create what Western countries need the most: strong growth. All in all, the central banks’ new ventures have created ten major worrisome developments. Let’s take a look at the first two now. First, many advanced economies now lack a proper path to economic growth. They currently have a tough time generating growth, which means it’s difficult for them to improve their living standards, reduce poverty and invest in the future. To compensate, a lot of wealthier nations have been seeking to “steal” growth from other countries by having their central banks print more money than they usually would. A currency’s value decreases when there’s more of it, so exports get cheaper and imports get more expensive. In that sense, growth is “stolen” from countries with more valuable currencies because it forces them to import more of these cheaper exports. Needless to say, this approach of stealing growth hasn’t resulted in economic growth in the Western world. Furthermore, the West runs the risk of neglecting certain structural reforms, such as tax reforms, which could have the potential to revive long-term, economic growth. Central banks have also failed to reduce unemployment, which remains high in a lot of developed countries. Greece, for example, had a 25 percent total unemployment rate in early 2015 and a youth unemployment rate of over 50 percent. High unemployment is caused by the lack of economic growth, which hinders the creation of new jobs. It’s hard to overstate the dangers of unemployment. A high unemployment rate is dangerous for both individuals and the state, as it prevents the state from overcoming debt and makes the future uncertain. Economic frustration has also fueled the rise of extremist groups like Greece’s Golden Dawn, a neo-Nazi party. In recent decades, globalization has been closing the worldwide gap between rich and poor countries. Yet within each country, income inequality is increasing. In fact, income inequality is now higher than at any point in the past fifty years. The average income of the top 10 percent of the Western world is about nine times higher than that of the lowest 10 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the OECD. A big income inequality gap means a correspondingly big gap in access to education and health care. Unfortunately, central banks have caused this gap to widen thanks to their low interest rates, which help big companies but hit regular citizens especially hard. Institutional credibility has also been waning. Stable economic prosperity is dependent on institutional credibility, but politicians and financial institutions are causing people to lose their faith in banks and governments. Before the 2008 crisis, governments allowed banks to take irresponsible risks that ultimately brought the global economy to the brink of a collapse and caused thousands of people to lose their savings. As the crisis raged on, governments proved ready to bail these banks out. This behavior severely damaged the central banks’ reputation and, since they’re state-owned institutions, that went hand-in-hand with a decreased trust in the state. The erosion of trust in the system has also contributed to political dysfunction. Politicians tend to be afraid of making big compromises, as compromises might cost them their careers. But an unwillingness to compromise only prevents us from moving forward out of this global crisis. In the United States, for example, the two political parties now find it very difficult to agree on trade pacts or basic infrastructure projects. We’ve seen that domestic nationalist political movements are on the rise. Unfortunately, this isn’t the only increasing global concern. Geopolitical tensions are also on the rise because Western economies can no longer manage the international monetary system. The Western countries are the heart of the current global financial system. The United States is the most influential player in both of the world’s two most powerful financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund, or the IMF, and the World Bank. These institutions were founded on the belief that Western economies were stable, therefore making it safe to pin global economic and financial stability on their central banks. However, advanced countries have failed to deliver that stability and emerging economies are seeking to undermine the Western-dominated financial system. The BRICS states (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), for example, are now trying to build their own financial institutions to rival the IMF and the World Bank. Such institutions aim to take power away from the West, which generates more geopolitical tension. Moreover, the regulation of the banking sector is also presenting new economic risks. Central banks aim to reduce irresponsible risk-taking by regulating the banking system, but that incentivizes big financial players to look for risks outside the financial sector, in areas such as home or health-care insurance. The financial world, too, has its own emerging set of dangers, like liquidity risks – the risk that an investment can’t be sold off quickly enough to prevent the investor from incurring a loss because the market value of the investment falls too fast. Ongoing liquidity risk is another consequence of the central banks’ regulatory intervention. When less risk-taking is allowed, there are fewer buyers in the market to buy up what sellers have to offer. If you’re the head of your company, you take a risk when you invest in training your labor force. You can’t be sure it will eventually pay off. If you’re an investor, you take a financial risk with your investment: you can’t know whether the share price will rise or fall. In other words, companies take economic risks and investors take financial risks. There’s a strong contrast between these two forms of risk-taking in the modern global economy. Financial risk-taking is high whereas economic risk-taking is low. A lot of companies are hesitant to take economic risks, preferring to save their earnings rather than invest them. Investors in financial markets, on the other hand, often take huge risks by straying far from their area of expertise. An investor who previously invested in the oil industry might turn to the housing market, even if he has no prior experience in the field. Low economic risk-taking is bad for the economy because it prevents companies from making long-term investments in critical areas, like developing new equipment or training their labor force. High financial risk-taking is also bad for the economy because it can result in big losses and instability. Another problem with this risk-taking is that economies, companies and households can’t thrive even if they’re well-managed. Imagine how hard it would be to maintain a nice house if your neighborhood were steadily deteriorating. The overarching pessimism and economic malaise also hurts well-managed economies, companies and households. Even if they perform well on their own, they struggle to realize their full potential in a market or industry that’s doing poorly. It would be nice if there were one simple solution for all the global economic problems of our time. Alas, there is not. But there are four key measures we can take to help regenerate growth. First off, we need to take the idea of inclusive growth – growth that benefits everyone – more seriously. Central banks have proven to be ineffective at fostering inclusive growth with their financial engineering. Instead, we have to focus on structural reforms, like strengthening infrastructure and improving education systems. Those reforms strengthen recovery because good infrastructure and a stable labor force help countries adapt to changes in the global market. Secondly, we have to resolve the disparity between the willingness and the ability to spend. Countries like Greece are willing to spend but not able to, whereas Germany can but doesn’t want to. Strict austerity policies – or policies of minimal spending – such as the strategy employed by Germany, need to be revisited. Austerity hinders the positive effect government spending has on infrastructure, education reform and health care. Third, debt overhangs need to be removed. High, persistent public indebtedness harms production and discourages people from making new investments. Heavy debt burdens prevent investors from pumping fresh capital into the economy. They need to be lifted. Finally, we have to improve the design of the global economy. Think of the global economy like an orchestra with different sections – brass, percussion, strings, etc. Each section might be good on its own, but if they’re not playing in synch with the guidance of a conductor, the music will be incoherent. The global economy needs a conductor. The IMF, whose job is to ensure global financial stability and foster economic growth, might be a good candidate. Where is the current economic course leading us? It’s impossible to predict the future, but we do know a few things. In the future, countries will likely be divided into four groups: those that prosper, those that are slowly growing, those that stagnate and those with a volatile future. The first group will consist of countries like the United States and India. The US economy will continue to be prosperous, though it remains to be seen whether the United States will regain the global power it had before the crisis. India seems likely to see annual growth rates in the 6 to 8 percent range, which will result in prosperous growth. The second group will consist of countries whose growth rate has declined because of the crisis, but which have managed to emerge with a new, relatively stable economy. China, where growth will stabilize in the high 5 to 6 percent region, will be the leader of this group. Stagnating countries will include Europe as a whole, as well as Japan, which won’t be able to break out of its low, 0 to 2 percent growth rate. These countries have little hope for growth because of their high debt and high unemployment. Countries in the fourth group are the wildcards. They have big regional influence but very volatile economies. The most prominent country in this group is Russia. Western sanctions and low oil prices have pushed the country into a recession, but constructive reengagement with the West might lead to economic recovery. Greece is also a “wildcard” because its ability to recover depends on whether or not it can cut its debt burden. The key message in this book: Central banks play a significant role in the global economy, but they have been pushed into dangerous and uncharted waters since the 2008 crisis. Instability and income inequality are on the rise as a result, and geopolitical tensions are increasing. Financial risk-taking is irresponsible and societies are growing more frustrated with their political systems. The global landscape will continue to become more divergent if we can't find a way for nations and central banks to work together in a way that benefits everyone. Got feedback?

They contend that new diseases are unstoppable, famine will kill billions, overpopulation will ruin the environment and climate change will destroy the planet. Many of these experts argue that the solution to escaping these impending modern catastrophes lies in the past. They suggest that because past societies lacked such modern problems, they were simpler and more idyllic. Some even argue that our own society should be modeled on those of the past. In reality, this rose-tinted view of history is far from the truth; the past was a truly dreadful time to live. Right up until the Industrial Revolution, life was dominated by violence, famine, illness and early death. In early hunter-gatherer societies, where neighboring tribes fought for scarce resources, violence was often imminent. Many burial sites from the era show evidence of entire communities massacred by blows to the head, or struck by arrows, spears and darts. Famine and illness were also constant threats to early societies. Communities lacked adequate agricultural technologies, so they were especially susceptible to drought, crop failures and famines, which often led to malnutrition, decreased fertility and starvation. Disease was rife and the prevalence of aggressive bacteria like gangrene and tetanus made every wound potentially deadly. There’s just no comparison to modern times. Today, the living standard of human beings is at an all-time high. Since 1800, the global population has grown by a factor of six, life expectancy has doubled and real income has increased almost ten-fold. Today, most of us live incredibly safe and healthy lives. We are lucky to live in the modern world – life in the past was violent, arduous and short-lived. Humanity hasn’t always possessed a natural ability to trade and interact. Early humans existed in small familial or tribal groups and did not produce many significant advances in technology. That changed, however, with the discovery of cooking. Cooking was the first step in our cultural evolution. More calories can be obtained from a cooked food than a raw food, and it requires less chewing. As a result of cooking, more nutritious food could be shared by more people in less time. Cooking also led to the early specialization of labor: women collected grains and staple carbohydrates, while men hunted larger animals for protein. This, along with the extra nutrition gained from cooking, created a surplus of food, which led to the beginning of trade. As trust between strangers slowly increased, we began to trade things other than food. This trading developed into the first innovation networks, 160,000 years ago. For the first time, people had access to different communities’ cultural traditions, raw materials and technologies. They could also share knowledge, even between distant communities. Archeological sites from the era show evidence of similar tools and ornamental shells appearing in sites hundreds or thousands of miles apart. This cultural evolution was vital to human development. The welfare of humanity skyrocketed as we benefited from the collective knowledge of our trading partners. In fact, cultures that lacked successful trading networks are shown to have had a smaller collective knowledge, and became deficient in technologies. For example, 10,000 years ago, the Tasmanians were cut off from the mainland by rising seas, and consequently their use of technology deteriorated. They lost the ability to make cold-weather clothing, fish hooks or barbed spears. Their isolation meant they did not advance along with those on the mainland. The discovery of cooking facilitated the first innovation networks, allowing knowledge to flow between civilizations. Long before the onset of a trade-based society, most human interactions between strangers were rather violent, and war over limited resources was fairly common. Over time, however, as we started living in larger groups and trading with outsiders, things changed. We developed a deeper sense of trust in each other, which propelled humanity forward and still benefits us today. Exchange is a uniquely human attribute, and a crucial element in the development of trust. Through exchange, people began to recognize that they could best serve their own self-interest by cooperating with strangers. Both parties could gain value by offering something the other could not make or obtain by themselves, thereby increasing the wealth and knowledge not only of individuals, but also the community. The connection between trade and trust is evident because in places where exchange thrived, personal self-interest withered and living standards rose. During the commercial revolution in Florence in the 1300s, the economy flourished when business partners created a system of reciprocal credit, which extended large amounts of trust to those who supported each other. A trusting society is also key to the further accumulation of wealth. Societies with high levels of trust are generally richer than those with low levels. Wealth is important because it helps to foster a culture of cooperation and respect for individuals. In relatively rich Norway, for example, over 65% of the people say they trust each other, while in relatively poor Peru, only 5% of the population has trust for their fellow citizens. The expansion of trade between communities launched an explosion of trust, which is vital to the creation of wealth. Before the cultural evolution of trade and the specialization of crop growing, communities could grow no larger than their local food supply would allow. Due to their limited resources, drought or crop failure could prove disastrous. As trading expanded, however, farmers were incentivized to find more efficient means of growing food. When successful, they could store the surpluses to guard against future shortages or trade them for better equipment. Nine thousand years ago, when Greek farmers began trading with tool makers, they obtained new technology that increased their own productivity and allowed them to specialize their farming even further. Trade made surpluses more common and famines rarer. Although trade spurred many agricultural advancements, it also helped to produce another problem: overpopulation. In many countries, the steady access to food caused birth rates to explode. In the 18th century, Robert Malthus famously argued that population growth was outpacing the finite productivity of the land, which could lead to dwindling resources and cause millions of people to die. Though potential overpopulation was a dire threat, innovations over the last few centuries solved the problem. First, draught animals that required extra land to graze were replaced by the internal combustion engine. Instantly, more land was freed up for farming rather than grazing. Second, the invention of fertilizer in the early 1900s boosted the productiveness of the soil, enabling more food to be grown on smaller amounts of land. The progress over time has been dramatic. As hunter-gatherers, each human needed 1,000 hectares of land to sustain their life. We now need only a tenth of one hectare each. Thus, a huge global population can be sustained with less fear of famine. Trade and innovation have eliminated the historical threats of famine and overpopulation. The first cities appeared about 7,000 years ago along trade routes in Mesopotamia, where goods from different parts of the world were exchanged. People flocked to these trade routes to obtain wine, metals, olive oil, wheat and wool, or other goods they could not source locally. In the cities, demand for these goods and the products made from them facilitated the first merchants and professional tradesmen. For the first time in history, people could make a living from trade, rather than living off the land. The rise in new professions was essential to the growth of cities and fostered an increase in global innovation. Successful cities used this technological advantage to create more efficient modes of travel, which, in turn, improved trade. The Phoenicians, for example, used a special timber that was traded in their ports to build boats that were stronger, faster and larger than any others at the time. Cities also helped the development of ideas. It is difficult to sustain the development of ideas in isolation, but cities attracted diverse trading partners, and so the collective knowledge of the society gradually expanded. As fresh ideas cross-pollinated with others from around the globe, education increased. For example, Pythagoras is said to have borrowed his famous theorem from a student who was learning geometry on trading expeditions to Egypt. Cities have continued to spark innovations over the centuries. The world marveled at the sheer volume of inventions developed in London in 1800. This burst of innovation wasn’t because the people of London were smarter than everyone else, but because the city was drawing talent from across the globe. Innovators knew that, in London, their ideas could mingle with the important ideas of others. Cities cultivated a place for ideas to incubate and spread. The development of cities rapidly increased innovation and encouraged the cross-fertilization of ideas. The story of civilization is the story of learning to use energy more efficiently. It started initially when we learned to cook our food, thus gaining more calories from it, and continued when we began to use domesticated crops, allowing us to capture more of the sun’s energy. Soon we were using draught animals to increase productivity, wind power to move our sailboats and streams to turn our waterwheels. Time and again, humans prosper when we make efficient use of stored energy. By far the greatest boost in energy efficiency occurred with the discovery of fossil fuels like coal. These fuels sustained the Industrial Revolution, and by the late 1900s they accounted for 85% of the world’s energy use. Because fossil fuels were so efficient, the brutal practices of slavery and animal labor were suddenly uneconomical and largely discarded. Fossil fuels amplified the productivity of every worker, raising the income and living standards of people from every social class. Energy sources like coal are not without their downsides. For example, they emit carbon dioxide, radioactivity and mercury. Nevertheless, the benefits have been astounding. In 1870s Britain, to match the amount of energy produced by coal you would have needed the work of 850 million laborers, which would have required 20 times the nation’s wheat harvest to feed. Today, we are still driven by our desire to use energy efficiently. When the first steam engines arrived, they only converted 1% of their heat energy into useful work, but we currently produce combine-cycle turbines that are over 60% efficient. Societies are consistently getting more and more work from each unit of fossil fuel. Human progress has been driven by our desire to capture and use energy more efficiently. Perhaps the most talked about impending calamity of the modern era is climate change. We hear constant dire warnings from experts, politicians and environmentalists warning us that we must change our ways, as the planet is in trouble. But even if you believe the dire predictions, there are reasons to be optimistic. In fact, the warnings are a result of the world becoming richer. The main reason for a rise in temperature is more fossil fuels being burned in developing countries. This is a result of these countries joining the global trading economy, leading to increased prosperity in the developing world. Even if climate change becomes a reality, a richer world would be a better protected one. As developing countries grow, they increase the wealth and living standards of their citizens. Wealthy nations spend more money on protection, such as insurance, and have a relatively tiny death rate due to weather. For example, when a Category 5 hurricane struck relatively wealthy and prepared Yucatan in 2005, there were no human casualties; yet, when a similar storm struck Burma the following year, there were over 200,000 deaths. There is an even more optimistic outlook: perhaps climate change will be altogether avoided. Environmentalists may demand a reduction of carbon emissions, by force if necessary, but reductions are happening naturally anyway. Innovation continuously introduces more efficient technologies. As human energy use moved from wood to coal to oil to gas, the ratio of carbon atoms to hydrogen atoms fell dramatically. In 1800, carbon atoms made up 90% of all combustion used to make energy, but by 1935 it was only 50%. If this trend continues, innovation will have pushed most carbon atoms out of the energy system by 2070. Trade and innovation will increase the wealth of poorer countries without increasing the damage from climate change. All across the Internet, twenty-four hours a day, strangers are sharing photographs, advice, recipes, donations, and even medical records, all without the promise of receiving “real” money in return. Humans are sharing for the sheer satisfaction of helping others, and contributing to a wide network of knowledge that raises our collective knowledge in ways that cannot be underestimated. Although we all live separate lives in our particular corners of the planet, the entire world is now connected by a revolutionary networking capability: the Internet has become a global city in which the knowledge of almost everyone on the planet can be freely shared. A massive cultural evolution is underway, due to the Internet’s unique capacity to specialize in one thing: exchange. This new ability of people from all social classes and geographic locations to teach, learn, entertain, buy and sell has accelerated the cross-pollination of ideas. Each person with an Internet connection now has access to goods, services and concepts that were once unattainable. When we engage directly with people across the globe, it enriches the lives of both parties in a way that has never been possible. Like the innovation networks of the early trading societies, the Internet brings together products, services and ideas, allowing them to morph, change and cross-pollinate. This is particularly good for our species because, when the collective knowledge of a society is freely shared and understood, it leads to the dissemination of even more useful knowledge. The Internet is allowing the collective brain of humanity to create and store more knowledge than ever before. The sharing of global ideas through the Internet has vastly expanded the collective knowledge of humanity. You only have to look at the incredible achievements of the past to be optimistic about the future. A study of our human history shows a steady advancement of ideas, knowledge and standards of living. Life is always getting better. This is possible because the world of ideas is infinite. When ideas are shared, they begin to thrive and become stronger. Since the 1800s, our accumulation of collective knowledge has given rise to increasing returns on living standards. When more people understand the concept of a bicycle, for example, then more people will create new uses for it, and new technology based on it. When we discover more efficient ways to share ideas, it raises the bar for all of humanity. Often, we don’t realize what we have until the idea is shared around. The invention of the laser in the 1950s was dismissed as “an invention looking for a job,” but as more people understood the concept of a laser, they built on its foundation and discovered uses for it. Today, lasers are used in thousands of applications, such as playing music, printing documents, sending messages and assisting with surgery. Our growing reserve of useful knowledge contributes something to each new advancement. When forecasting the future, it is common for pessimists to assume there will be no technological change – and, indeed, the situation would be bad if civilization were not to advance. But as long as we continue to exchange and share, our species will progress, and human ingenuity will continue to raise the overall standard of living. And the 21st century will be an amazing place to live. Living standards rise when ideas are shared, which means the 21st century will be an exciting place to live. The main message in this book is: Compared to their counterparts throughout human history, most people living today are richer, healthier and safer than ever before, thanks to the unique human habits of exchange and specialization. Despite the overwhelming pessimism that exists, there is every reason to believe that innovation and technological advancement can help us overcome any obstacle we may encounter.  This book in blinks answered the following questions: Why is today the best time to be alive? We are lucky to live in the modern world – life in the past was violent, arduous and short-lived. The discovery of cooking facilitated the first innovation networks, allowing knowledge to flow between civilizations. The expansion of trade between communities launched an explosion of trust, which is vital to the creation of wealth. What are the best reasons to be optimistic about the future? Trade and innovation have eliminated the historical threats of famine and overpopulation. The development of cities rapidly increased innovation and encouraged the cross-fertilization of ideas. Human progress has been driven by our desire to capture and use energy more efficiently. Trade and innovation will increase the wealth of poorer countries without increasing the damage from climate change. How can exchange and innovation lead us to a better future? The sharing of global ideas through the Internet has vastly expanded the collective knowledge of humanity. Living standards rise when ideas are shared, which means the 21st century will be an exciting place to live. 3-5 great quotes from the book “I am a rational optimist: rational because I have arrived at optimism not through temperament or instinct, but by looking at the evidence.” “Even those who have several paying jobs [...] have only two or three occupations at most. But they consume hundreds, thousands, of things. This is the diagnostic feature of modern life, the very definition of a high standard of living: diverse consumption, simplified production. Make one thing, use lots.” “Without trade, innovation just does not happen. Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution.” “This leads to a shocking irony. I am about to argue that economic growth only became sustainable when it began to rely on non-renewable, non-green, non-clean power. Every economic boom in history, from Uruk onwards, had ended in bust because renewable sources of energy ran out: timber, cropland, pasture, labor, water, peat. All self-replenishing, but far too slowly, and easily exhausted by a swelling populace.” 2-4 actionable ideas from this book in blinks Be positive. A brief look back at the history of human advancement gives us reasons to think that the future will be bright. Human ingenuity and innovation have tackled each major obstacle we have ever come across. Although the challenges facing us today may seem daunting, they are not without the possibility of solutions. Share your ideas. It leads to a better world. The most important advancements in the late 20th century were in the ways humans communicate with each other. With an Internet connection, we now have the ability to share, exchange and build upon the ideas of virtually everyone in the world. Because the world of ideas is infinite, sharing ideas raises the collective knowledge and welfare of the entire planet. Without sharing and exchange, neither the innovator nor the recipients can benefit.  ","headers":["We are lucky to live in the modern world – life in the past was violent, arduous and short-lived.","The discovery of cooking facilitated the first innovation networks, allowing knowledge to flow between civilizations.","The expansion of trade between communities launched an explosion of trust, which is vital to the creation of wealth.","Trade and innovation have eliminated the historical threats of famine and overpopulation.","The development of cities rapidly increased innovation and encouraged the cross-fertilization of ideas.","Human progress has been driven by our desire to capture and use energy more efficiently.","Trade and innovation will increase the wealth of poorer countries without increasing the damage from climate change.","The sharing of global ideas through the Internet has vastly expanded the collective knowledge of humanity.","Living standards rise when ideas are shared, which means the 21st century will be an exciting place to live.","Final summary","Shareable content"],"category":"Economics","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/529364c9623136000c0b0000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"The Rational Optimist addresses the major problems that have faced human beings since the dawn of civilization, and describes how methods of exchange and specialization created innovative solutions to deal with each new obstacle.

Western media, when it mentions Africa at all, brings reports of war and famine, of political corruption and distress. But is this all the massive continent has to offer? Well, the simple answer is no. Africa is not a continent that can or needs to be saved by the West. Instead, Africa, with its wealth of resources and innovative approaches, could actually be the solution to the problems faced by the rest of the world. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Africa has enough arable land to feed the whole world; why mobile technology is making a radical change to banking in Africa; and how renewable energy is providing the power Africa needs to prosper. Anyone who pays close attention to international news and history knows that Africa has seen more than its fair share of war and famine. But even if you’re aware of the turmoil in Africa, you might have missed the news reports in July, 2011, when southern Somalia suffered one of the worst famines in its history. That month, nearly three million starving refugees poured into Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital, hoping to receive emergency aid from the UN. Over the course of the year, 300,000 of them died; the majority of the casualties were children and elderly people. Many didn’t even survive the journey: Khalima Adan, a 38-year-old woman, lost three of her nine children during the long trip to Mogadishu from the countryside. When the author met Khalima, her 7-year-old son Umar had just died in her arms, and she didn’t even have the strength to cry or grieve. Given that efficient foreign aid could have saved thousands of lives, you might be wondering how we can allow tragedies like this to occur. Sadly, the West, occupied with its own political interests and the war on terror, often fails to help Africa. In fact, according to Tony Burns, an Australian aid worker on site in Mogadishu, the United States deliberately blocked all aid to southern Somalia during the famine, despite the pleas coming from humanitarian agencies. The United States denied aid in large part because of a group known as Al-Shabab, which is regarded as an enemy in the war on terror. Al-Shabab was active in the area and they had been known to intercept, tax and steal some of the incoming aid money. However, by being more concerned with Al-Shabab and the war on terror, the United States ushered thousands of Somalis to their graves. You probably only know George Clooney as a handsome Hollywood star. There’s a bit more to the guy than that, however. Indeed, George Clooney is actually one of the most influential Western humanitarians trying to help the people in Sudan. Clooney was highly involved in the peace agreement that led to South Sudan’s independence. He was a prominent and vocal advocate for its freedom, appearing on television, as well as speaking directly to President Obama and members of Congress. But Clooney wasn’t content with simply campaigning for Sudan on his home turf. In the time leading up to the peace agreement, he traveled to Juba every year, working on site to raise awareness about the massacres against the southern rebels being committed by the Sudanese government. He even spent his own money to rent a satellite that could track the movements of the Sudanese government troops, which made it impossible for them to deny the crimes they had committed. And Clooney was there in the newly appointed capital city of Juba in January, 2011, when 98.8 percent of the people voted to become independent from the North. Despite this work on their behalf, however, Clooney couldn’t bring lasting peace to Sudan. Even after South Sudan gained its independence, it still contained two rival ethnic groups, the governing Dinka and the rebel Nuer. In December, 2013, the disagreements between these two groups escalated into all-out massacre: after two weeks of conflicts, Dinka officials rounded up and executed 240 Nuer men. The violence continued until April, 2016, when the government and the rebel groups managed to come to a fragile peace agreement. All this goes to show how the well-intentioned efforts of the West often fail to bring lasting change, and that, if peace can be reached, it will have to come from within Africa. Thankfully, as we’ll see in the next blink, this process is already under way. In the previous blinks, we’ve seen how effective solutions to Africa’s troubles can be hard to come by. But there is one area with great potential: farming. Indeed, it may be the key not only to ending poverty in Africa but to world hunger. After all, when we look back at history, farming is the best way for a country to develop wealth. For example, the United States-funded International Food Policy Research Institute has shown that when the income of farmers increases by just one percent, extreme poverty diminishes by a factor of at least 0.6 percent to as much as 1.8 percent. China is a perfect example of economic development through farming. From 1978 to 2011, as agricultural incomes increased by 7 percent each year, Chinese poverty levels decreased from 31 percent to just 2 percent. And Africa, with its 1.46 billion acres of farmable land, is in a good position to take advantage of this kind of growth. With more arable land than the rest of the world combined, Africa has the potential to end world hunger. With this in mind, Africa is moving from simple-survival agriculture to mass-production agriculture. We can see this happening in Ethiopia. Until recently, Ethiopian farmers only purchased basic necessities and produced enough food to feed themselves. Increasing production was therefore too risky; spending more and having one bad crop would mean bankruptcy. But this all changed in 2007, when Eleni Gabre-Madhin, a leading Ethiopian economist, created the Ethiopian Commodities Exchange, a central trade organization for farmers that’s revolutionizing farming practices in the country. Inspectors were hired to check produce quality and provide security to buyers and sellers, and the organization also established fair crop prices and sent the information out to farmers via a mobile phone service so they could predict future incomes. This helped banks feel more secure providing farmers loans to invest and grow their farms. As a result, between 2006 and 2013, overall agricultural production has increased in Ethiopia by 7.8 percent. If you’ve looked at photos taken in urban African communities, you might have seen images of children rummaging through enormous piles of garbage, looking for something to eat or sell. These images can give you the impression that the situation in Africa is beyond hope. Although Africa is home to some of the poorest, most run-down cities in the world, change is taking place. In 2009, the Nigerian city of Lagos was crumbling. 65 percent of the city’s 20 million inhabitants lived in extreme poverty, surviving on less that $2 a day. The people of Lagos had no running water, electricity or sewage system – a tragic embodiment of modern Africa’s failures. But, in just a few years, even the dire slums of Lagos were transformed into a functional city. When Babatunde Fashola was elected governor of Lagos, in 2009, he was determined to transform the city into a beacon of hope. And sure enough, within a few years, two thirds of the city had access to clean water, compared to just one third in 2009. During that time, a large portion of the city was also protected against flooding; green public parks began to appear where garbage dumps once stood; and streets were rebuilt and equipped with lights. The efforts to rebuild Lagos didn’t just create a new city. Forty-two thousand new government jobs were also created, providing an important economic boost to the citizens. But the new governor didn’t stop there. Fashola also wanted to transform the slums on the outskirts of the city, so he hired Peruvian poverty specialist Fernando De Soto. Together they worked to give residents property rights, which quickly restored order to the chaotic slums. Burglaries decreased by a staggering 90 percent, and incidents of murder and assault dropped by 50 percent. Additionally, these new property owners also helped strengthen the overall economy by becoming taxpayers. With news, media and films focusing primarily on the negative aspects of Africa, it’s easy to picture African leaders as a corrupt and vicious bunch of despots. This, however, is far from a complete picture. Some African leaders have more in common with the Queen of England than with criminal thugs. When the author met North Nigerian leader Lamido Sanusi, Emir to the city of Kano, he was greeted by a graceful nobleman fluent in both English and French. A student of economics, philosophy and law, Sanusi’s fierce integrity ended up costing him his job at the Central Bank of Nigeria, where he had been fighting corruption, much to the displeasure of his bosses. At one point, he denounced the practices of Nigeria’s petroleum minister, who leased planes from her own private company, thereby paying herself each time she took a business trip. But being fired from the Central Bank didn’t diminish Lamido Sanusi’s integrity, and, as a leader of the city of Kano, he plans to continue his fight against corruption and bring prosperity to Nigeria. Sanusi is using technology to his advantage and promoting a biometric system for all money transactions in Nigeria. With this system, Nigerians could use their fingerprints to make cash withdrawals and pay for goods in shops. This method is one of the most secure forms of money transaction imaginable and has the potential to make fraud, theft and forgery a thing of the past. And with fingerprint technology making all monetary transactions immediately traceable to the registered individual, Sanusi hopes this will also put an end to the corruption that still weakens Nigeria. When the first radios appeared in remote areas of the world, people previously cut off from civilization suddenly had access to the music and voices coming from nearby urban populations. But this is a minor development compared to the impact mobile phones are having in Africa. Cell-phone technology is providing Africans with a direct connection to the entire world. In 2015, one billion cell phones were operating throughout Africa. This is incredible when you consider that, just 15 years ago, only a few million Africans had a landline telephone connection. Another astounding discovery is the link between cell phone penetration and national economies. Cell phones allow people in for example remote African locations to work together efficiently, despite being separated by miles of harsh terrain. This saves a great deal of time and promotes economic growth. In fact, a series of studies carried out in various African countries by the London Business School found that a ten percent increase in the number of cell phones resulted in a corresponding rise in national income of 0.6 to 1.2 percent. Cell phones have also resulted in Africa’s adopting brand new mobile banking systems. The most popular form of mobile communication in Africa is texting, since it costs very little. Sensing an opportunity, Kenya’s telecommunications giant, Safaricom, introduced a text-based system allowing people to transfer money. It works like this: Kenyans give cash to a Safaricom employee who then transfers the money to a specified phone number. The money can then be passed on by sending a PIN-secured text to anyone who also owns a cell phone. This includes local grocers, hairdressers or even someone on the street asking for spare change. The system took off in 2013. People weren’t using it just to do their shopping; by accumulating this virtual money, people were turning their cell-phone accounts into savings accounts. This made sense for a lot of poor people who were being denied an account by more traditional banks. In 2015, these methods became so popular that 50 mobile-banking firms sprang up across the African continent, making Western nations start to wonder whether they should follow suit. It’s easy to take the benefit of a working light bulb for granted. But for many rural and poverty-stricken Africans, living without electricity is an everyday problem, and only recently are people starting to see the light at the end of this long, dark tunnel. In fact, a lack of electricity can act as a poverty trap, preventing the poor from escaping their situation.   Gladys Nange is a 39-year-old mother and farmer who lives in a village called Kokete. This village is situated in a remote part of Kenya near the Ugandan border, where the government has never managed to bring power cables and electricity. Therefore, Gladys’s children are unable to finish their homework in the evening and end up with bad grades at school. What’s more, Gladys is forced to walk five kilometers to the nearest electrical plug in order to charge her phone and check the day’s crop prices. Francis Morogo, the village chief, admits that no one from Kokete has ever made it to a university, and most people remain in the village their whole lives. Fortunately, solar panels are becoming a mobile and ecological solution to Africa’s power shortage. In fact, Gladys Nange herself took part in a pilot solar energy project. She now has a small panel on her house that produces enough power to feed two lamps and a mobile charger. This mobile solar kit, the creation of a Cambridge University project, is affordable, with a payment plan of only $1.20 per month, and it could change the lives of many. Gladys’s children, for instance, can now finish their homework under lamplight and Gladys can save time and earn more money, with plans to install an electrified hatchery for the chickens on her farm. The key message in this book: The African continent cannot be reduced to unending conflicts, war crimes, tyrannical despots and extreme poverty. Africa is a growing and innovative continent that is developing strategies and technologies to deal with challenges in ways that can only bring inspiration to the West.  Actionable advice: Invest your money wisely if you want to help Africa.  Aid projects that bring food and water to the starving in times of crisis are laudable, but they will not bring lasting change to the continent as they only make Africa dependent on the West. So only invest in projects that help Africans become autonomous, such as projects to bring solar power to African farmers. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

After all, your smartphone or laptop is interacting with millions of others across the globe, and it has access to well over a billion interconnected web pages. Complex systems such as the internet have undoubtedly made our lives easier, and, as technology improves, they’ll increasingly improve our existence. But we need to be careful. If we want to make the most of complex networks, society must keep up with technological change. At the moment, it’s far too easy for people to use networks against us: terrorists can use the internet to spread their message, criminals can hack into our data and speculators can use the increasingly complex financial system to crash the economy. Only by constantly keeping our institutions and infrastructure up-to-date can we hope to prevent this disruption. These blinks explain how we as individuals and as a society can survive and thrive in this complex age. In these blinks, you’ll learn why we need a seventh sense; why you shouldn’t consult Doctor ELIZA; and why gatekeepers can make your life hell. Back in the nineteenth century when the industrial revolution was in full swing, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche shrewdly said that people needed a “sixth sense.” In other words, he meant that, as a society, humans would need to develop another instinct in order to keep up with the pace of technological change. Today, it’s necessary for people to develop a Seventh Sense to comprehend the complex connections of networks which have formed between people, mobile devices, computers and financial markets as a result of technological advancement. To develop a Seventh Sense, you first have to understand that everything is interconnected. Take the unveiling of the first iPod in 2001. The device not only fundamentally changed the way people listen to music; it altered the music industry itself. After the product was launched, people stopped using Discmans, and CD shops began to close while MP3 sales flourished. Eventually, this led to the rise of streaming services such as Spotify. In essence, the old analog network was replaced by a new digital network. As technology moves rapidly, old network systems are frequently replaced by new ones – the author refers to this process as network power. To understand network power, look at the way that English is presently used as a global lingua franca. The language enables information to be shared in a simple manner among people from different countries across the world, making it a powerful network of exchange. Currently, switching languages seems inconceivable. However, eventually, lingua francas like English will be replaced with real-time machine translation between many languages because that is the nature of network power. Advanced connectivity has allowed this technology to develop. One day, you’ll be able to jump into a taxi in Madrid and say “good morning,” and your taxi driver will instantly hear “buenos días.” There will come a time when a translation algorithm will be more vital than having the ability to speak and comprehend English. Rewind to the dawn of the internet age. If you were told back then that the development of the web would eventually lead to Syrian terrorists finding an easy means to indoctrinate children, would you have supported such innovations? The influence that networks currently have on society is more far-reaching than anyone could have anticipated. Institutions are struggling to keep up with the progression of these networks, as is evidenced by the way terror attacks are handled. After 9/11, the war against terrorism was launched. A Pentagon analysis team surveyed records of terrorists’ deleted phone calls and SMS and discovered that terrorist networks were developing at a much faster rate than the government or military were able to monitor. In 2003, US troops learned that a terrorist in Baghdad had managed to conceive a way to make a bomb that was able to penetrate American tanks. A mere ten days later, an identical bomb killed a US official in rural Afghanistan. Although the troops planned to update their tank defense, they were too slow compared to their enemy’s fast-paced mode of attack. The terrorists’ network of communication was simply more advanced. Even newly recruited, barely educated terrorists on the internet manage to elude the government’s old-fashioned, slow systems. The Pentagon’s task force, known as the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), found that terrorists tended to visit sites containing instructions on how to make bombs. Other terrorists would also provide real-time advice in encrypted chat rooms to which the American government was unable to gain access. To combat their activity, JIEDDO installed devices to monitor the streets. Although this plan worked to prevent individual attacks, it did nothing to address the heart of the problem. Historically, emperors, presidents, kings, queens and authority figures like doctors or lawyers have presided over power and influence in predetermined hierarchical structures. However, in current times, world leaders and other experts are in a constant battle to maintain their power thanks to challenges from modern networks. Networks are characterized by two different forms of power: high concentration and large distribution. Doctors are one group under threat from powerful networks. Doctors were once considered to be the main source of medical knowledge, but that no longer seems to be the case. Instead of booking an appointment to see a doctor, nowadays people tend to google the symptoms of their illness. Various medical websites are easily accessible, and people can join communities where they can discuss their affliction with those who suffer from similar diseases – this is a large distribution setup. Due to the high number of people who use the search engine and the amount of information being shared, Google can be defined as a highly concentrated network. Google is therefore both a source of large distribution and high concentration – this means that, ultimately, the medical sites accessed through Google harbor more power than a cardiologist like the author’s father, even though he has years of experience as a doctor. To better understand networks, it’s important to be able to distinguish between complicated and complex systems. Jet engines and calculators consist of several interacting components, but are designed to complete only a limited set of unchanging tasks; they are therefore complicated systems. On the contrary, complex systems like the World Wide Web are ever-changing and harder to control. Noting the difference between the two is essential. The former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, learned this the hard way. He confessed that the failure of European officials to treat the financial market as a complex system led to the 2008 financial crisis. The traditional models and tools which were available at the time were not enough to sustain such a complex structure. If Trichet and his team had identified the financial market as a complex system, then they would’ve been better equipped to approach problems effectively. The networking age has offered up a range of possibilities, but it’s important to remember that each innovation comes with a unique set of flaws and unforeseeable consequences. As the French philosopher Paul Virilio once said: “When you invent the plane, you invent the plane crash.” Take cyber attacks, a major issue today. Back in 2015, Jung Hoon Lee, a South Korean hacker, was awarded $225,000 at an annual hacking competition for accessing the most vital networking programs at the time by infiltrating web browsers such as Apple’s Safari and Google Chrome. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars hiring the best programmers in the world, yet Jung Hoon Lee was able to overtake their security in less than a minute. Hackers like Jung Hoon Lee prove that there’s a negative side to our new internet-led world. Complex networks inevitably invite dangerous repercussions; more advanced security systems simply lead to more advanced methods of attack. Generally, people tend to be too trusting of networks where caution is needed. Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at MIT, coded two programs called DOCTOR and ELIZA – both of which would be able to respond to basic questions posed by humans. When conceiving ELIZA, Weizenbaum made use of the psychotherapist Carl Rogers’ conversational technique of responding to a question with an open-ended question such as “Can you think of a specific example?” Due to this method, ELIZA proved highly popular. As a result, Weizenbaum received numerous letters from renowned psychologists claiming that ELIZA could potentially replace the need for counseling. Weizenbaum wasn’t excited by this prospect; he became frightened by the power his program had generated, as people readily trusted it with personal information. However, he eventually concluded that ELIZA wouldn’t replace the need for counseling anytime soon. It was only a computer program after all. Increased connectivity means that, as a society, we are not only vulnerable to constant monitoring and control by institutions, but by anyone who can bypass existing forms of virtual security. A closed network such as a Wi-Fi network is referred to as a gateland. Gatekeepers have to grant access. Gatekeepers are people or protocols with the power to decide who’s allowed to gain access to a particular closed network. In the case of your work Wi-Fi, the encrypted Wi-Fi password is the gatekeeper – only those who know it are permitted to have a speedy connection to the internet on a secure network. The higher the number of people who use a certain gateland, the harder it becomes to utilize an alternative. The economist Brian Arthur discussed this concept in the Harvard Business Review, referring to the impact of a phenomenon known as “network effects.” Say you’re new to the internet and ten of your friends start using Facebook. It’ll be harder to branch out and use an alternative social network instead because your friends won’t be there. The more users there are in a network, the greater the number of connections there can be. This explains why Windows runs on 90 percent of PCs worldwide and Android runs on 81 percent of smartphones. Being excluded from a network by a gatekeeper can also have detrimental effects. Bob Metcalfe, an electrical engineer, designed a connection protocol called Ethernet which would eventually become the main way to connect computers together. The term “Metcalfe’s law” emerged from his protocol; it states that the value of a network increases as the number of people who utilize the network grows. At Stanford University, the number of computers connected to the Ethernet network increased rapidly. Peers frequently used the Ethernet to easily share notes over email. In this instance, imagine that you’re a student denied access to the Ethernet. You would instantly be at a disadvantage as you wouldn’t have access to the same information as your fellow students. Imagine a graver situation. If there were a database of cancer genetics with information from a million users to which you weren’t granted access, this exclusion could prove fatal. You wouldn’t be able to comparatively analyze your genes with others to identify any patterns which may require medical attention. One day, the process of withdrawing bank notes from an ATM and giving it to another person who ends up depositing that same cash into their own account will be an outdated system replaced with fully digitized payments. This may sound promising, but there are several risks involved in a new, interconnected world of digital currencies. Those who seek to maintain anonymity and be untraceable could pose serious problems, but fortunately, there are solutions in place. Hard gatekeeping serves to protect those inside a network’s community. Hard gatekeeping is the development of a protected, trusted and well-designed community that safeguards its users from both the perils of online trade and cyber threats. Eventually, digital currencies such as Bitcoin are bound to replace physical money. Mobile phones and virtual banks have already begun to outline the future of currency. The Bitcoin protocol acts as a gatekeeper as it protects its users from being identified, but this has resulted in many drug dealers and tax evaders utilizing the network. Cybercriminals are able to easily gain access to the Dark Web where users’ identities are hidden and Bitcoin is the main form of currency. To bypass these issues, a new gateland will be conceived involving a reliable form of digital currency that’s trackable, and the government will serve as a hard gatekeeper keeping everything in check. Currently, billions of dollars worth of foreign aid are mishandled and eventually end up in the wrong hands. When digital currency is monitored correctly, however, teachers, nurses and students will receive their donations in full. Digital currency itself will become a gateland where the network protects all users regardless of socioeconomic status. Increased connectivity can bring positive outcomes, but there are downsides. Gatelands can, of course, help protect against cyber attacks, but, just now, interconnectivity is not without problems. The key message in this book: Networks can offer endless opportunities, but the more connected society becomes, the more susceptible people are to various attacks by those who have the power to bypass online security. Therefore, it’s important to be cautious when operating online.  Actionable advice: Read the terms and conditions of a site thoroughly.

Enron’s fall from grace is probably the most scandalous business story of our times, its skyrocketing profits followed by the largest bankruptcy case in US history. But how does a respected company make it to the top of the business world, only to crumble into economic tragedy? In these blinks, you’ll venture into Enron’s past to learn about the fascinating people behind this infamous scandal, and will see how greed and deceit can lead to such a dramatic demise. You’ll also learn why egomaniacs and backstabbers were welcome at Enron; how financial structures sneakily camouflaged existing debts; and  what went on in the company’s closed-door meetings. Does it ever feel like history is repeating itself? It sure seemed that way in 2001 when the American energy colossus Enron filed for bankruptcy. The company’s demise due to huge debts and fraudulent business practices mirrored problems they had experienced years earlier, when first starting out.  In fact, in 1987, just two years after it was founded, Enron was already saddled with debt.  Enron was formed in 1985 through a merger between two pipeline companies, Houston Natural Gas (or HNG) and InterNorth. An intelligent and ambitious man named Ken Lay assumed the role of CEO, and in 1986 the company was renamed Enron.  Unfortunately for Lay, it wasn’t long before Enron was in dire financial straits. By early 1986, Enron reported a first-year loss of $14 million, and by January 1987 its credit rating was at junk status. What happened? Enron had been engaging in dishonest business practices that had brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and a specific subdivision called Enron Oil was causing the most trouble. Enron Oil wasn't producing or selling oil, but simply speculating on oil prices; not only that, but the oil traders were manipulating their earnings.  For example, they would set up deals with fake companies that let them take a huge loss on one contract, only to cancel out these losses with a second contract that generated the same amount in profits. Their fictitious losses enabled them to move earnings from one quarter to the next.  Enron was trying to prove to Wall Street that it could turn a steadily increasing profit, a trend that the stock market is quick to reward. However, by 1987, Enron’s oil trading game had taken such a loss on high-risk bets that the entire company was on the verge of bankruptcy.  But Ken Lay was prepared to act. He assured analysts on Wall Street that this downturn was just a freak event that could never repeat itself. But as we now know, this kind of deceit and carelessness was at the very core of Enron’s company culture. Enron managed to pull itself out of its first crisis, but by the end of 1988 it was in hot water once again. The company’s main problem was that it didn’t have a business model that could turn real profits, an issue Enron hoped to solve by hiring Jeffrey Skilling.  Skilling, formerly a consultant for McKinsey and a graduate of Harvard Business School, joined Enron in 1990, taking the position of CEO at a new subdivision called Enron Finance. A very bright man, Skilling was a major force behind Enron’s transformation into a successful company – at least temporarily.  First, Skilling turned Enron into what he called a Gas Bank. The idea was that gas producers would sign a contract to sell their product to Enron, who would in turn sign contracts with customers. Enron’s profit was the difference between what it paid the producers and what it charged its customers. But Skilling saw another way to make money through these contracts: trading the agreements themselves.  The second step in Skilling’s master plan was to convince Enron to use mark-to-market accounting.  While conventional accounting works by entering revenues and profits from a contract as the money comes in, mark-to-market accounting logs the total estimated value of the entire contract on the day it’s signed. So, by immediately posting all potential profits, companies that use mark-to-market accounting appear to be growing quickly. This, in turn, pleases Wall Street speculators and the stock goes up.  Finally, Skilling forged a corporate environment in which sheer brains were valued more highly than skilled management and hands-on experience. In fact, he used to say that he liked to hire “guys with spikes,” meaning that if an executive boasted a single talent, or a spike, Skilling would take him on board regardless of any shortcomings.  That spawned a company full of egomaniacs, social misfits and backstabbers – which didn’t bother Skilling as long as they cunningly did what he needed them to.  But is it possible for a company to ride a wave of success solely propelled by a brilliant workforce? Not in the case of Enron.  It was Jeff Skilling who transformed Enron, but until the mid-1990s, most people outside the company had no clue who he was. The face of Enron to the outside world was in fact Rebecca Mark – the female star in a male-dominated industry.  Until the 1990s, developing countries were usually overlooked by corporations in the West, even though they had massive populations and matching energy needs. Rebecca Mark was the head of a company subdivision called Enron Development, and her task was to strike energy deals with as many developing nations as possible, thereby flying Enron’s flag the world over.  So, she set out around the globe, and by the mid-90s Enron Development appeared to be wildly successful, with Mark getting credit for making it happen. While she was happy to play up her good looks and dazzling smile, Mark’s signature characteristic was her optimism, resolutely believing that everything would work out well.   But despite her smiles and assurances, Mark gradually tainted the deal-making culture at Enron Development; her subordinates were made to think their task was simply to secure as many deals as possible, a result of Enron’s flawed compensation structure. For instance, developers were paid bonuses on a project-by-project basis, meaning that they got paid when a deal was closed – before a single pipe was laid or a foundation poured. Therefore, developers had no incentive to follow through with deals they’d signed, and there was nobody else at Enron to take responsibility for projects once they were off the ground.  So, while Mark assumed nothing bad could happen, disasters were taking place every day. For example, in 1995, Enron invested $95 million in a Dominican Republic-based power plant. But as it turned out, the Dominican Republic government wouldn’t pay for the power the plant generated. As a result, by mid-2000, Enron’s huge investment had returned a mere $3.5 million! In 1996, Enron announced that Jeff Skilling would be the company’s new president and chief operating officer, or COO. Newly installed at the top of the company, Skilling quickly began remaking Enron to suit his image. Trading became Enron’s central focus, but Skilling also de-emphasized old projects like pipelines and the production of natural gas. Although Enron had already become the biggest name in the natural gas industry, Skilling wanted to go further. He wanted even more trading, and to deal not just in gas but to expand into the electric power sector as well, even though Enron was still an outside player in electricity.  While refashioning the company, Skilling took every chance he could to shed its old business operations, even ones that were profitable. As a result, by the end of the ‘90s, Enron had witnessed a profound shift: trading and cutting deals were now its core business.  But Skilling’s changes had other consequences, a major one being that Enron became a place where risk taking and financial deceit were practically inevitable. Why? Because Skilling’s tactic for generating Enron’s annual earning targets was absolutely ludicrous: he would set a fabricated number that simply reflected what Wall Street wanted.  The problem was that a company founded on trading and making deals can’t possibly rely on its earnings to steadily rise, since trading desks can earn or lose millions in one fell swoop.  As a result, the deals Enron brokered came with increasingly greater risks, and Enron’s Risk Assessment and Control department, or the RAC, would step aside as long as a deal had the necessary commercial support. At the same time, thanks to the mere existence of the RAC, Enron could paint itself as a company that handled greater risk more carefully than any competitors.  But to hit the earning targets it promised investors, Enron had to pull a few tricks; the company overstated its future revenue to delay recording the losses it was actually taking. While Skilling transformed the nature of Enron’s business, it was Andrew Fastow who transformed its finances.  It all began when Fastow, who had been a part of Enron’s financial division since 1990, was promoted to chief financial officer, or CFO, in 1998. He and his team went to work masterminding Enron’s finances to close the gap between the reality of the firm’s business and the picture Skilling and Lay wanted the world to see.  How? By creating financial structures that hid Enron’s debt.  Take Whitewing as an example. This Enron subsidiary was created in 1997 to purchase and sell off the company’s poorly performing assets. Say Enron constructed a power plant at a cost of $8 million and expected the plant to be worth $10 million – the company would mark a $2 million profit in its books.  When the plant underperformed, drawing a market value of just $7 million, Enron should have erased the $2 million profit it logged and replaced it with a $1 million loss. But instead, Enron would just sell the plant to Whitewing for the full $10 million. Whitewing would in turn sell it for $7 million and be compensated with the remaining $3 million in Enron stock.  Since the $3 million worth of stock Enron issued wouldn’t show as a loss on the books, the company had essentially disguised a $1 million loss as a $2 million profit.  But Fastow wasn't just making money for Enron – he knew how to pay himself too. For example, in 1999 he started a fund called LJM, named for the initials of his wife and two sons, Lea, Jeffrey and Matthew. Not unlike Whitewing, LJM invested in Enron’s badly performing stocks, a venture that allowed the company to keep them off its balance sheets.  However, Fastow heading LJM while also holding the position of CFO at Enron was an obvious conflict of interest, because he could essentially negotiate with himself. In the end, Fastow’s dual positions allowed him to quietly make tens of millions of dollars in personal profit. Enron couldn’t ride it’s fraudulent accounting practices forever. The company thought of them as a life preserver that would keep their business looking good until Skilling came up with another plan to make real profits.  Skilling’s first idea was to get into the electrical energy business, mainly because, by the mid-1990s, retail electricity was regulated by state governments. Enron was banking on the fact that the market would eventually be deregulated; when that happened, they would be perfectly placed to sell electricity straight to businesses and homes across the country.  There was just one problem: local energy providers organized a fierce backlash to stop deregulation, leading only a few states to actually curb regulations after all. And in California, a state that actually let Enron sell power directly to customers, Enron spent over $20 million on ads to bring in new business. However, despite the discounts Enron could offer, consumers weren’t ready to switch away from the reliable utility they’d always used in the past. In addition, Enron simply didn’t belong in the business of electricity. For instance, to woo customers, Enron promised to make huge improvements to efficiency – the only problem was, they didn’t have the first clue how to do it.  OK, so Skilling’s first plan was a bust, but what about his second? Well, it turned out to be a colossal failure, too.  Skilling pitched broadband as Enron’s next big thing, asking why Enron couldn’t trade bandwidth capacity just like it did natural gas. So, in 1999, Enron promised that it would soon be capable of delivering real-time bandwidth-on-demand. To do so, it would build a sophisticated new broadband network system.  At the time, Enron painted its system as “lit, tested, and ready.” But in reality, it wasn’t anywhere close to operational on a commercial scale, and a great deal of the technology they promised never even made it out of the lab. The fact was, Enron couldn’t provide bandwidth-on-demand then, and they never would. Given what you now know about Enron, it might be hard to believe that Thomas Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, said the executives at Enron had “the aura of whiz kids, of golden boys who could do no wrong.” In fact, Skilling and Lay were even being mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Apple’s Steve Jobs.  Analysts had kept blind faith in Enron’s performance. Take Enron’s annual analysts meeting of January 2000, an annual affair in which Skilling and other executives reviewed each business unit’s performance.  The meeting’s highlight? The company executives unveiled Enron’s new broadband strategy by confidently stating the company would become “the world’s largest provider of premium broadband delivery service.” Skilling even predicted that the new business venture would be worth a whopping $29 billion! Naturally, the room went mad, with some 200 analysts making rushed calls to their trading desks and telling them to invest in Enron. As a result, the company’s stock rose 26 percentage points in just one day. In fact, not one of the analysts in attendance ventured to ask a probing question; the mood was one of absolute praise for Enron.  So, while it might seem that the analysts themselves weren’t in the know, there was a surprisingly large circle of people who knew exactly what lurked beneath Enron’s shiny exterior.  For instance, many of the analysts knew the firm’s recorded earnings were well beyond the actual money coming in. In fact, J.P. Morgan analyst Kyle Rudden wrote in mid-1999 that “ENE [Enron’s stock symbol] is not a cash story...Enron has significant flexibility in structuring contracts and hence booking earnings.” But that’s not all the analysts knew. They also knew that Enron had huge quantities of off-balance-sheet debt, debt that doesn’t show on a company’s statement of financial position; even so, they only occasionally mentioned this in their reports.   On December 13th, 2000, Skilling was standing atop Enron’s peak: the company had just announced that he would take Ken Lay’s position as CEO. In celebration of his promotion, Business Week printed a reverential cover story, naming him America’s second-best CEO – just behind Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer. Skilling hadn’t even held the job for three months.  But despite the praise for Skilling, skepticism about Enron’s success was beginning to surface. On September 20th, 2000, Jonathan Weil – reporting for the Texas Journal, a regional supplement of the Wall Street Journal – published a story focusing on energy traders’ reliance on mark-to-market accounting, Enron’s essential tool for logging profits before the cash actually came in.  Upon reading the story, an influential hedge fund manager named Jim Chanos began investigating further. He discovered that although Enron was reporting steadily increasing earnings, the business itself didn’t appear to be earning much money at all. He took his skeptical views about Enron to Fortune magazine, and in March of 2001 they published a story with the headline “Is Enron Overpriced?” The piece made note of Enron’s lack of cash flow and rising debt, but also revealed the mounting skepticism toward Enron in the investment world.  That skepticism grew even more when Skilling unexpectedly left his position as CEO. On August 14th, 2001, the company announced his departure and said that Ken Lay would return to fill the role. Skilling’s statement to investors was, “There is nothing to disclose, the company is in great shape...this is an entirely personal decision.” But the move definitely looked strange. Why would such an ambitious CEO resign, just like that, only six months into the job? It was inevitable that Skilling’s sudden resignation would raise another wave of speculation into potential troubles at Enron. The day after Skilling’s resignation, a mid-level Enron veteran named Sherron Watkins mailed an anonymous letter to Ken Lay saying, “I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals.”  Nonetheless, Lay appeared unperturbed and, according to one Enron executive, “Ken thought there was nothing wrong with Enron that what was right with Enron couldn’t fix.” But regardless of what Lay said, Enron’s massive debt and plummeting stock were poised to send the company into a cash crisis.  A few of the deals Enron had made in order to bring in cash stipulated the immediate payback of billions in debt if Enron’s stock price and credit rating dropped past certain points. Since the media had unveiled how Enron was playing fast and loose with its finances, its stock had already dropped below the allowable limits of these deals, and the company’s credit rating was nearing junk territory.  By way of example, Enron’s stock had dropped from an August 2000 peak of $90 per share to below $20 per share in October 2001.  The company’s executives needed to find two or three billion dollars in a hurry, or its panicked creditors were going to shut the company down. But even that was out of the question, as banks had already made clear that Enron’s line of credit was bone dry.  Their only hope to avoid going bankrupt was to merge with Dynegy, another Houston-based energy trader that Enron had always held in contempt. Initially, Wall Street traders seemed to think the deal was a good idea, but they soon began to have second thoughts, as did the executives at Dynegy – after all, did Dynegy really know what a merger with Enron had in store? In short, the deal failed and Enron, without any alternatives, filed the biggest bankruptcy case in the history of the United States on December 2nd, 2001. In the wake of Enron’s collapse, everyone involved – even the board of directors – denied all responsibility. But by 2003, their charade was starting to fall apart, as prosecutors for the United States Department of Justice began issuing a long list of indictments. In the end, 33 people were indicted, and among them were 25 former Enron executives.  Here’s what happened to the people at the top – Lay, Skilling, Fastow and Mark: In 2004, Fastow pled guilty to all charges. He spent six years in prison and was released in 2011, admitting that he had “engaged in schemes to enrich [him]self and others at the expense of Enron’s shareholders.” He later added that “I and other members of Enron’s senior management fraudulently manipulated Enron’s publicly reported financial results. Our purpose was to mislead investors and others about the true financial position of Enron, and consequently, to inflate artificially the price of Enron’s stock and maintain fraudulently Enron’s credit rating.” Ken Lay passed away before spending a day in jail. He had been indicted on ten counts including conspiracy, making misleading statements and fraud. He pled not guilty to all charges and was found guilty of every one of them. But on July 5th, 2006, before the court had determined his sentence, he collapsed while with his wife outside of Aspen, Colorado – he had died of a heart attack.  Jeffrey Skilling was indicted in 2004 on 35 counts, including conspiracy, fraud and insider trading. Skilling was found guilty of 19 of his charges, despite maintaining that he “had no idea that the company was in anything but excellent shape.” In 2006, he was sentenced to over 24 years in prison and a $45 million fine.  Oh, and Rebecca Mark? She left Enron in August of 2000, before the scandal went public. She had sold her Enron stock at its peak, raking in a whopping $82.5 million. Mark was never accused of committing any crimes.  The key message in this book: The energy giant Enron used fraudulent business practices, including a toolkit of accounting scams and a toxic deal-making culture, to artificially inflate its stock. The company’s deceitful tactics inevitably led to its collapse, which ended in the biggest bankruptcy case in US history and a slew of indictments.  Actionable advice: Don’t let stock prices become an obsession. Enron’s stock price became all Jeff Skilling could think about. The company’s Wall Street standing was like his report card, and when away from the office he would call in multiple times a day to check on the stock’s performance. Keeping an eye on the financial health of your company is key, but Skilling’s obsession was the spark that ignited criminal impulses, which eventually landed Enron in hot water. Keep in mind that, generally, the quicker a stock rises, the more likely it is to plummet soon thereafter.  So, instead of solely focusing on ensuring a rising stock price, invest your energy into slow but sustainable business growth!

In these blinks, you’ll learn why there is still space for manufacturing companies in the West; where the smartest people in the world live; and which projects and ideas the world’s smartest people are developing.  Have you heard the term rustbelts? It refers to formerly industrial areas in the United States and Europe, places that have largely declined in affluence because of the offshoring of manufacturing to cheaper production sites in countries such as China, Bangladesh, Mexico and Turkey. But that’s all starting to change. Some of these rustbelt regions are transforming into brainbelts; regions that have been revitalized through the formation of hubs that unite knowledgeable workers with smart manufacturing. Just take the new production facility created by General Electric, an iconic company that produces aircraft engines and household appliances, among other products. Rather than offshoring their production to Asia, GE set up shop in Batesville, Mississippi because of its close proximity to Mississippi State University. In this new location, researchers work with cutting-edge materials to revolutionize the production of aircraft engines. GE had already been working with the university and, because of the great results the collaboration was producing, decided to become its neighbor. The choice has proven to be a boon to GE, as the work between the two institutions brings together innovation and smart manufacturing. However, just because some companies succeed with this model doesn’t mean that emerging markets in the East are no longer a threat; rather, these markets are just facing stiffer competition. For instance, many Western industrial powerhouses have had to close their doors, overwhelmed by the low-cost production model – built largely on cheap labor – employed in East Asian countries. That being said, the rise of brainbelts is causing concern for some Asian companies. Just consider the Taiwan-based Mediatek; for years, they’ve been a powerful force in the global marketplace, designing chipsets for smartphones and other such electronics. Despite this success, the company’s CFO, David Ku, has expressed grave concerns about the increasingly competitive nature of US firms. He pointed to the San Diego-based company Qualcomm as an example, saying that they’re way ahead of the game in terms of research and development. So, you now know why brainbelts are important. Next, you’ll learn how exactly they come about. Although each brainbelt is unique, they all share certain basic characteristics. One common characteristic of brainbelts is a collaborative ecosystem to which countless people contribute. Here’s how these structures function: Generally, brainbelts operate with a research university at their core. From this base, a variety of other institutions branch out, which can include start-ups or more established firms, community colleges and local governmental authorities. Each of these different institutions are closely interwoven into one another’s activities. Just consider the Hudson Tech Valley in Albany, NY, also known as the Albany brainbelt. At the center of this grouping is the State University of New York and the private research university Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. These core institutions are surrounded by manufacturing businesses and community colleges, all of which collaborate on semiconductor research, which plays a significant role in computer technology. Another core attribute of brainbelts is an openness to sharing knowledge and expertise. This results in freedom between sectors, such as industry and academia, but also between disciplines, like math and biology. Instead of being hoarded, knowledge and expertise are shared to undertake the complicated projects that come to define these brainbelts. Beyond that, companies within brainbelts tend to be highly specialized, which means their knowledge rarely overlaps with that of their collaborators. This is key, as it keeps the threat of competition to a minimum. A great example is the Oregon Health & Science University located in Portland. This institution had collected a wealth of data on cancer patients, but didn’t have the computing power necessary to process it. Intel, also a major player in the Portland area, was able to pool its computers to process the university’s data. The two partners were excited to share their knowledge and expertise since they weren’t in direct competition. Quite the contrary, each depended on the ability of the other, and they were thus glad to work together. But these aren’t the only key characteristics shared by brainbelts. In the next blink, you’ll learn about a few more. Do you consider yourself a focused person? Well, not everyone does. Some people want to be doctors one day and geologists the next. But for brainbelts, this isn’t an issue. Another main characteristic of these innovative sites is their focused effort. Instead of taking on a wide range of activities, brainbelts invest their energy in just one or two. For instance, the Hudson Tech Valley in Albany works primarily on semiconductors like chips and sensors, while the life-science brainbelt in Zurich, Switzerland focuses on biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals. Another defining feature of brainbelts is their use of smart manufacturing. Unlike traditional manufacturing operations that are focused on cost and worker efficiency, brainbelts’ smart manufacturing strategy emphasizes concepts such as customization and automation by using technologies like 3-D printing and robotics. For example, the authors visited America Makes in Youngstown, Ohio, which was formerly known as the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute. During their trip, they met Kevin Collier, who manages the Innovation Factory there. He told them that 3-D printing enables both rapid production of prototypes and real manufacturing. So, while aircraft manufacturers can use 3-D printing to create certain engine components, people in medicine can also use this technology to produce customized body parts, like personalized hips and knees for injured veterans. Not only that, but robotics allows for automation that’s both cheap and smart. Just consider Baxter, a humanoid robot used by Scott Eckert, president of the Boston-based firm Rethink Robotics. Baxter works as an assistant at the company, lifting and rearranging various objects, including other robots. He cost $22,000 to produce, which is a pittance considering he can work for 6,500 hours without getting sick or taking a vacation. That breaks down to an hourly wage of just three dollars! Now that we’re getting a clearer picture of how brainbelts work, let’s take a closer look at one in particular to see how it rose from the ashes of collapsed industries. If you’re searching for examples of industrial hubs that went from great to bad and back to great again, you need look no further than Akron, Ohio. Here’s the story of this rustbelt-turned-brainbelt: Because of its strategic location, Akron used to be an industrial powerhouse. Its convenient location near Detroit and right between New York City and Chicago made the Detroit car industry a key contributor to its supply chain and resulted in tire giants like Firestone and Goodyear basing their operations in Akron. The city’s location also made Akron an essential railway hub in the transportation of cereal grains produced in the region. For instance, Quaker Oats did a great deal of business in the area, reflected by the proliferation of the company’s massive grain silo complexes. But then, in the mid-twentieth century, things began to shift as Akron failed to account for the competitive threat arising overseas. After years of profitable, stable business, the tire companies had become too accustomed to their success; they were so detached and inward-looking that they failed to take notice of their powerful competitors in China and Mexico, and adapt their business strategies accordingly. When they finally did wake up to this reality, it was too late. Akron withered away into dormancy and the sites were abandoned. Well, for a little while at least – the brainpower of these industries remained, which was central to Akron’s eventual revival. Many of the skilled workers who had previously worked in the tire industry began their own firms. In addition, the president of the University of Akron, Luis Proenza, began to reposition the university to become a strong central force in the city. Much of the industrial and educational work in Akron was focused on polymer science, which was quickly broadening into the realm of new materials science. By sticking to a field in which many local residents were already skilled, Akron managed to rebuild its success. One great example is Akron Polymer Systems. Working with polymers, this firm develops films for the LCD screens used in solar cells, among many other things. Climate change is probably the single greatest challenge facing humanity in the twenty-first century. For far too long, we’ve extracted and burned dirty fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. But there’s still hope for the future. New technology being developed and manufactured in the brainbelts could help mitigate some of the devastating effects caused by human-initiated climate change. After all, our only hope today is to develop new, cheap sources of renewable energy, which is exactly what many brainbelts are focusing on. Just consider the Centennial Campus in North Carolina. At this site, the company ABB is collaborating with university researchers to improve certain components of the electrical grid. This existing network of lines ensures the delivery of energy from producers to consumers – but it could be made a whole lot smarter. For instance, consumers could become their own producers, creating, storing and even selling their own energy, as made possible by home solar panels. By helping make such technologies an accessible reality, brainbelts are contributing to counteracting climate change. Another pressing issue that brainbelts are working on is the need to feed all of the 9 billion people who are expected to live on earth by 2050. To meet this gargantuan goal, we’ll need agricultural innovations in areas like greenhouse design and automated milking. Such technologies could help farmers meet the production needs for their local markets, and a prime example is the brainbelt surrounding the town of Wageningen in the Netherlands. The agricultural university there has partnered with several organizations of farmers and companies to boost productivity and efficiency in Dutch agriculture. Such collaboration has enabled this relatively small country to deliver an incredible 7.5 percent of all global food exports. Unless you were some kind of infant prodigy, you likely weren’t born with the ability to ride a bike. Kids need training wheels to get them going before they can ride on their own, and the same goes for brainbelts. To capture their full potential, these areas sometimes need a bit of help. This is important to note since, when people think of innovation, they tend to think of industry leaders like Apple, Google and Amazon. These companies have done exceedingly well at building immense technology empires and have all the resources and talent they need to keep innovating and succeeding. Unlike these titans of industry, brainbelts are weighed down by past stagnation, abandoned buildings and out-of-date infrastructure. That being said, they have the brainpower they need to shake off these disadvantages – as long as they can get a helping hand. One way such assistance can be provided to brainbelts is through national innovation policies and guidelines, as well as continued funding. Innovation policies and guidelines are essentially motivators for innovation and are therefore a big boon to brainbelts. While most countries have such policies on the books, not all of them do. Consider the United States. Although the US government has funded initiatives to encourage innovation over the years, there are no standing guidelines to support these expenditures. While people often look to Silicon Valley and assume that there’s no need for such policies, there are other young brainbelts all over the country – and, indeed, around the world – that would benefit tremendously from a helping hand. Beyond the need for policy support, continued funding is also crucial to newly emerging brainbelts. Luckily, many funding sources are available, from national governments to private companies. However, the process is far from perfect, since many of these resources are invested in the wrong projects. Just take the US technology sector. Lots of investors pour their money into Google and Apple, but fail to invest in the cross-disciplinary and innovative projects at the heart of the brainbelts. The key message in this book: The power dynamics of market forces are gradually shifting in the global marketplace. Sites of former industrial glory in the West, which have been decimated by the low-cost production methods of Eastern firms, are rapidly rebuilding themselves through the innovative use of shared brainpower.

Finding the common thread that runs through the patchwork of today’s complex and seemingly chaotic events is a tricky business. After all, what on earth could the Arab Spring, the use of targeted Facebook ads to swing a referendum in the United Kingdom and the plots of international terrorist cells have in common? In a word, networks. Whether you’re a global trader or just a casual Twitter user, chances are you’re hooked into a network that uses technology to share information and spread ideas. In the age of Brexit and Trump, such networks may seem utterly contemporary. But, as Niall Ferguson shows in this sweeping study of networks, what we’re experiencing now is only the most recent – and chaotic – act in a play as old as Gutenberg and the invention of the printing press. From the Reformation’s attack on Catholic dogma to the Enlightenment and the dissident groups of Communist Poland, networks have long driven historical change. Just as they are today, they’ve always been powered by technological innovation and, as they do today, they’ve always acted as vectors for radical new ideas. In these blinks, you’ll learn how the printing press created a network that changed the face of Europe forever; how the British built a global empire by making use of existing networks; and Why Donald Trump’s use of Twitter helped him beat Hillary Clinton. Some people view history as a kind of pyramid. At the top are the great kings and queens, with a vast hierarchy of knights, priests and peasants below them. Others emphasize the role of clandestine networks such as the Illuminati or the Freemasons, groups of people who, though acting behind the scenes, pull all the strings. But can either of these models really explain the historical process? In fact, both hierarchies and networks have molded most of our history. While hierarchies have usually had the final say, networks have long played a vital role in driving historical change and transforming societies. Take the global economic networks that emerged with the advent of steamships and railways, or the more recent changes precipitated by the emergence of communication networks centered around telephones or the internet. And social networks have also played a key role in change. The French Revolution, for example, was facilitated by the salons of eighteenth-century Paris, where different groups could meet to discuss their ideas. Networks and hierarchies also share a number of traits. Think of what a network really is. Simply put, it’s a set of interconnected nodes. These nodes can be people, trading ports or family members. And, because of homophily, our propensity to form networks with people similar to us, these nodes tend to be connected by some commonality. What unites us with others can be a shared status – such as ethnicity, class, age or sex – or a set of shared values derived from education, religion, occupation or other interests. A good example of this is the early twentieth-century Bloomsbury group. Consisting of authors and artists, the group took shape around a series of shared ideals concerning art, life, sexuality and politics. The connections between group members were sometimes even formalized through marriage. Indeed, these individual nodes were connected in so many ways that if you were to draw a line signifying each connection, you’d end up with a pattern similar to a spider’s web. The author Virginia Woolf, for example, married Leonard Woolf but was in love with the famous gardener Vita Sackville-West. At the center of the network was the economist John Maynard Keynes. Because he was connected to virtually every other node, he was the network’s hub or central node. Hierarchy works like this, too. The difference, however, is that the connections all run down from the top. The “central” node is in fact the apex of the pyramid. Everyone is connected to the top, with varying degrees of separation. But, as you proceed down the pyramid, there are fewer and fewer horizontal connections between individual nodes. So, although hierarchies and networks share similarities, networks are more interconnected. In the following blinks, we’ll dig a bit deeper and explore how networks function. A network is a series of nodes. But some networks are more effective than others. In general, the more interconnected the nodes in a network, the better that network functions. We can understand the importance of different nodes by analyzing their relative centrality in a network. Degree centrality, for example, measures the number of connections or relationships one person has with others. Betweenness centrality, by contrast, gauges how much information passes through a specific node. Think of a train station, which is a kind of node. Just as some stations see more commuters passing through them than others, some individuals handle and relay more information within a network. That doesn’t mean that an individual with high betweenness centrality necessarily has the most connections. Rather, they have the most important connections. Lastly, there’s closeness centrality. This is a way of assessing how many steps separate different nodes from one another. Individuals with high closeness centrality will usually have the best access to information when it’s widely spread throughout the network. High closeness centrality was crucial to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's hold on power: as the only person who was a member of all three of the most powerful communist party institutions, he was able to stay well informed while keeping the nodes beneath him in the dark. Nodes which enjoy a high level of centrality – the ones that are simply better connected than others – can be thought of as hubs. But it’s not just strong, direct connections that matter. Weak ties are also vital – though these occur between different networks. That’s well illustrated by the classic idea of there being six degrees of separation between different individuals. You can see how this works by looking at an experiment carried out by the Stanford professor Stanley Milgram in the late 1960s. Milgram sent letters to randomly selected people and asked them to forward those letters to specific people – that is, other nodes. In some cases, the recipients knew the person whom they were supposed to forward the letter to. That made the matter simple, and they sent the letter on directly. The degree of separation was one. But others didn’t know the intended final recipient and had to make use of intermediaries – people who did know them. The degree of separation increases by one with every intermediary. On average, the degree of separation between two people was found to be six. Five intermediaries were needed to connect any two nodes. That’s a great example of how important weak ties are in connecting different networks. If our connections were strictly limited to our own networks, people wouldn’t be able to communicate and interact with different groups. Weak links are like bridges between different social worlds. But weak ties aren’t the only way of connecting different networks. When these are missing, brokers can step in and play the role of intermediaries. The women who ran the literary salons of Paris – they were known as salonnières – did exactly that. By hosting Enlightenment thinkers and revolutionaries from different groups, they facilitated a dialogue between groups that would have otherwise remained divided by class and education. That, in turn, created the conditions for the French Revolution! At the dawn of the sixteenth century, the world was divided into around 30 empires, duchies and kingdoms, each ruled by powerful individuals. The only game in town was top-down hierarchy. But two networks were emerging that would shake the foundations of this old order. One of those networks was a product of Spain and Portugal’s exploration of the world. In the opening decades of the century, these two nations constructed elaborate global trading networks that spanned the world from east Africa – today’s Kenya and Tanzania – to Goa, in southeast India, Malacca, in the Malay peninsula, and Guangdong, in China. So what drove this expansion? There were two factors. On the one hand, new technologies, including better ships like the Portuguese caravel and galleon, as well as more precise maps, helped open up the world. But social networks also played their role. Sailors, for example, increasingly shared their newfound knowledge of maritime navigation. This vast trading network was a powerful battering ram against hierarchy. Wherever they encountered new societies, these trading empires challenged the traditional hierarchies. Meanwhile, in central Europe, a new innovation – Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press – was prompting the emergence of yet another network. Before the printing press, books and texts had been exorbitantly expensive and access to them was restricted to the rich and powerful at the top of the societal hierarchy. Churches and courts were the central nodes in the circulation of written material. Take Thomas Cromwell, the principal secretary to Henry VIII. Historical evidence contained in the 20,000 letters belonging to the Tudor State Papers archive shows the huge amount of degree centrality enjoyed by Cromwell. He was one of very few men with unrestricted access to information, and he had more than 2,149 correspondents! The printing press changed all that, and new information networks began popping up across Europe. Printing houses became the hubs of this new network. People flocked to them in search of information and knowledge. Gutenberg set up the first printing press in the middle of the fifteenth century in Germany. By 1500, some twenty percent of all Swiss, Danish, Dutch and German cities had their own printing houses. Books were now not only more widely available; they were a great deal more affordable. Take England. The price of books fell by 66 percent between 1450 and 1500. Between the late fifteenth and the late sixteenth centuries, the overall decline in price was an astounding 90 percent! The rise of the printing press didn’t just make itself felt in the falling prices of books. The circulation of written material also set the stage for a major challenge to hierarchy: the Reformation. The central hierarchy in Europe was the Catholic Church. So when a German priest named Martin Luther nailed up his theses attacking the church in 1517, it was more a revolution than a reformation that he instigated. Thanks to the printing press, word got out quickly. In the old days, would-be readers of Luther’s theses would have had to wait for someone to copy them out by hand. Now, it was only a matter of months before they could be read in Leipzig, Basel and Nuremberg. Over the course of the century, German printing houses published around 5,000 editions. And eight out of ten were in German rather than Latin, which meant that regular people could also read them and access the ideas contained therein. Protestantism went viral. It spread like a contagious disease, and the printing press was its vector. Citizens of cities with multiple presses were the most likely to convert to Protestantism, whereas the populace of cities without a press proved all but immune to the new creed. The old faith prospered where books remained scarce. Catholics mounted a ferocious rearguard battle to contain this “disease” and attempted to suppress Protestantism. But the networks of knowledge and ideas established by the new sect were surprisingly hardy, and they would go on to serve as foundations for the network revolutions of the future. Eliminating a network is a tricky business. Unlike a hierarchy, which relies on a few, highly centralized nodes that can be swiftly knocked out, networks are more evenly spread out. Take the English Protestants. The Catholic queen Mary I persecuted Protestants severely and quickly managed to eliminate 14 of the new faith’s 20 most important nodes. But these individuals – the creed’s partisans with the highest betweenness centrality – were swiftly replaced by others, such as couriers and financial supporters. The network proved resilient because centrality was more evenly dispersed across its members. Even targeting key individuals wasn’t enough to prevent the spread of Protestantism in England. And the success of the Reformation sparked another great movement. By undermining Catholic dogma and undoing its stranglehold on intellectual life, the new religious creed allowed people to think outside the box. This was the basis of the scientific revolutions of the seventeenth century. The great experimenters of that century – people such as Isaac Newton – were not only free to pursue unorthodox approaches. Thanks to the printing press, their ideas were easy to disseminate, too, and they quickly found a large audience. The printing press, the Reformation, the budding scientific revolution: each posed a threat to the established order. And, soon enough, hierarchies were being challenged on both sides of the Atlantic. In America, a multitude of associational networks helped launch the American Revolution and put the country on the road to independence. Take Boston, Massachusetts, a city that’s been synonymous with the revolt against British rule ever since the Boston Tea Party, a 1773 protest against tax laws that favored British tea importers. Although the colony was hierarchical, there were a number of men who functioned as weak ties between different networks and helped spread revolutionary ideas. Five associations in Boston, most notably the Freemasons, were central pillars of the independence movement. Of the 137 members of the associations, 86 percent of them belonged to only one organization. But several of them – Joseph Warren, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and Benjamin Church – were members of many more. Warren, for example, belonged to four, while the others belonged to three. Warren and Revere displayed the highest levels of betweenness centrality. They effectively functioned as brokers between networks. Removing either one of them would have severely undermined the strength of these networks. But thanks to these brokers, interconnected networks emerged and helped spread the idea of revolution throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Networks played a similarly vital role in the Enlightenment and the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. Two central nodes in the dissemination of revolutionary Enlightenment ideas were the philosophers Voltaire and Rousseau. Letter writing was central to these networks. Voltaire alone had over 1,400 correspondents. Like the literary salons we encountered earlier, this network of letters connected different thinkers and helped spread the idea of republicanism and people’s rule. There was an important difference between America and France, however. Whereas the former had a strong associational culture, France was a more hierarchical society. This difference would make itself felt in the revolution. The French Revolution was a bloody affair. Anarchy, massacres and terror accompanied the birth of the republic. In the end, the Jacobins set up the Committee of Public Safety in an attempt to impose hierarchical order on the bloodthirsty masses. One hierarchy replaced another. In place of the king came the revolutionary dictatorship that would ultimately pave the path for the Napoleonic empire and a new European hierarchy. Few historical events seem more improbable than the rise of an unknown Corsican soldier to the emperorship of France. But the French Revolution had shaken things up. This was a new world where anything was possible, and Napoleon Bonaparte stamped his name in the history books. After conquering most of Europe, Napoleon didn’t just reimpose strict hierarchy on France; he inadvertently reimposed it across all of Europe. In order to defeat France, Napoleon’s enemies had to join forces in an alliance. Once they had defeated their French nemesis, they quickly imposed a hierarchical settlement across the continent that would only be challenged a century later. Five powers were central to the new order. Britain, Prussia, Austria and Russia, the nations that had put an end to Napoleon’s bid for dominance, were joined by France in 1818, forming a pentarchy that would rule Europe for the next 100 years. These powers agreed to hold regular meetings to maintain peace and prosperity in Europe. The blueprint for their vision was finalized at the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The system they constructed was an effective one. Between 1715 and 1815, Europe was wracked by 33 wars. Between 1815 and the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, there were only 17. Not only that – the wars that did occur were generally less lethal. Global conflicts like the 18th century’s Seven Years War were completely avoided in the nineteenth century. So what was the secret to the longevity of this new order? In a word, networks. The 1815 agreement created a new network of interconnected hierarchies. Each of the five key powers of the pentarchy was a hub in a pan-European network. Because this kept the lines of communication open, the powers were able to resolve conflicts and quarrels between their members. In effect, this gave rise to a balance of power between the four continental nations, with Britain using diplomacy to maintain order among them. However much individual nations might gripe or grumble, they all accepted that the pentarchy had the final say in any single matter. And that prevented conflicts from escalating. Before 1914, there was not a single occasion in which all five powers simultaneously went to war. Networked hierarchies didn’t just define international relations between great powers, however. The monarchies that ruled individual countries also exemplified the combination of networks and hierarchy. Take the royal house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Queen Victoria of Britain and her husband Albert, as well as King Leopold, of Belgium, all belonged to it. It was also linked by marriage to the French royal house of Orléans, the Austrian Hapsburgs and the Romanov family in Russia. In this way, networks continued to play an important role in global affairs. In the nineteenth century, Britain began to outstrip both its friends and rivals, and it soon became the most powerful nation in the world. It built a vast empire and ruled the waves. So how did this tiny island nation achieve global domination? One reason for its success was the way it made use of existing hierarchies in its imperial network. Take Frederick Lugard, a British colonial administrator and the architect of the British Empire’s policies in West Africa. He pioneered “indirect rule,” a system that incorporated local hierarchical institutions into the empire’s own structures. That meant devolving power to chiefs and sub-chiefs and allowing them to keep those who’d once been their own subjects in line. If granted a fancy British title and allowed a limited amount of freedom, these men effectively agreed to work for the empire. But the British Empire was also a technological network. The Industrial Revolution and the emergence of strong capitalist networks of banks and other institutions meant that there were enough funds to bankroll vital technological infrastructure. Railroads, telegram networks and improved shipping soon connected the far-flung corners of the empire. In nineteenth-century India, for example, more than 25,000 miles of railroad were laid. That connected the country as never before. The transatlantic telegraph cable was another signature achievement of the empire, and it was constructed with imperial products such as Malayan rubber. This communications revolution laid the foundations for globalization and the unprecedented mass movement of people. Here, improvements in shipping were key. Travel was now not only faster; it was also less expensive. The cost of shipping between Liverpool and New York, for example, fell by 50 percent between 1830 and 1880. And over the next 34 years, it halved again! This in turn established the conditions for the first mass migrations of the modern era. Between 55 and 58 million Europeans left the old world behind and set sail for the Americas, while another 50 million Indian and Chinese people sought their fortunes across Southeast Asia, along the eastern shores of Africa and Australia. This was a tumultuous period. The arrival of migrants saw a populist backlash in both Europe and the United States that was closely linked to rising nationalism and racism. Chinese migrants on the West Coast in the United States, for example, were badly mistreated, while German populist politicians railed against Eastern European Jewish migrants. For just under 100 years, the pentarchy oversaw a period of relative peace in Europe. This peace was shattered in 1914, with the outbreak of World War I. Once again, established hierarchies were undermined, and the world order came under threat from emerging networks. One network that had grown quickly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was socialism. Lenin was a pivotal figure. One of many socialists in the European socialist network who hoped to take up the reins of government, he met with definite success. In 1917, he sidelined the more liberal opponents of the Russian Tsar who themselves had only taken power in February of that year. The Bolshevik Revolution in October completed the socialist takeover. Bolsheviks were successful because, unlike their liberal opponents, they were embedded in a network. They were well connected, and their ideology spread like a virus. Lenin’s death resulted in a period of bitter infighting among the Bolsheviks. Eventually, Josef Stalin emerged victorious and became the new leader of the Soviet Union. His reign saw the imposition of an extreme hierarchy over a body of atomized citizens. In this time, the fear of being denounced or framed by neighbors was all-pervasive. Petrified by the thought of being executed or landing in the notorious internment camps known as Gulags, people retreated into themselves and became disconnected islands in a sea of terror. As Stalin unleashed the first waves of terror in the Soviet Union, another lethal ideology was ascending in Germany. The Nazis also started out as a network. Unlike other fascist movements, which had gained momentum across Europe as a result of the Depression in the 1930s, the Nazis took power through the ballot box. That made them unique. In fact, of all the votes cast for fascist parties in Europe between 1930 and 1935, 96 percent were registered by Germans. That was a product of the rich associational life of Germany. Indeed, the Nazi vote grew by a factor of three every two years after 1928, especially in cities, where large networks already existed. The rise of the Nazi network also resulted in widespread disconnection. The party sowed fear among the population and, soon enough, Germans were also terrified of their neighbors. The Nazis’ “Third Reich” didn’t survive Germany’s defeat in World War II. The Communist Soviet Union, by contrast, lived on to fight another day. In the postwar era, it would vie with a new superpower for world dominance – the United States and its NATO allies. The postwar period was defined by the Cold War, a conflict between two massive and hierarchical structures: the US-led NATO alliance and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Although both of these alliances were networks, they were each arranged hierarchically around a central hub – the United States, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union, on the other. In both networks, decisions and information flowed outward from the core to the periphery. But in the years after World War II, hierarchy wasn’t restricted just to military matters. A similar top-down organization was also evident in the economy. Take the “M-form” corporation pioneered by Alfred Sloan, longtime CEO of the American car-manufacturing giant General Motors. Sloan thought corporations should be built around a hierarchy, with stockholders at the summit, directors and the company president below them and a number of multi-legged departments at the base that didn’t interact with each other but simply referred back to the central node. It quickly became a new norm in business organization. That said, networks didn’t disappear entirely. In fact, they made a dramatic comeback toward the end of the twentieth century, above all in the Communist countries. After lying dormant during the hard winter of the Stalinist period, the first shoots of associations began to reemerge in the 1970s as the fear of being associated with non-Communist organizations began to recede. This development was most pronounced in Poland, where working-class dissidents, educated liberals and academics and Catholics began to connect with one another. The network that started to take shape out of these elements grew quickly, expanding by around 40 percent between 1969 and 1977. By the 1980s, the Solidarity trade union had become its central node. The government attempted to crack down on these new networks – but the networks’ influence continued to grow nonetheless. In June 1989, Solidarity finally managed to pressure the Communist party into accepting free elections, and the union won the subsequent electoral contest handsomely. That set off a chain reaction throughout Eastern Europe. By September 1989, Hungary had also adopted free elections. And in November, the Berlin Wall came down. Hardliners in the Soviet Communist Party attempted a coup in August 1991. After its failure, the Soviet Union also crumbled. One of the two dominant hierarchical structures of the twentieth century had suddenly exited the stage of world history. By the 1970s, hierarchical structures were also on the wane in the United States. The networked civil-rights movement that had emerged during the previous decade had rolled back the institutions of racial segregation. And other hierarchies were beginning to look similarly fragile. The world was becoming less rigid. Henry Kissinger, Nixon’s secretary of state, called it an age of “interdependence.” Different nodes, whether countries, coworkers or institutions, would no longer be able to exist in splendid isolation from one another. Each element was dependent on the next. As the world became more interdependent, it also became more complex. Central planning, the forte of strong hierarchies, was less effective. Awareness of this fact rippled through society. Businesses realized that they’d become too hierarchical. Directors, the central nodes in business structures, were overburdened by information; workers, meanwhile, had become so specialized that introducing simple changes to a product’s design disrupted the whole production process. As the old hierarchical structures crumbled, the network that embodies our modern understanding of the concept began to take shape – the internet. Far from being the product of centralized military planning, the internet grew organically. In fact, it started with something as simple as a few computers talking to each other. By 1983, the need to connect more computers had led to the use of TCP/IP, a protocol that allowed any computer – regardless of its own internal structure – to use this network for communication. Once open-source tools for web communication such as HTML, HTTP and URL had been added to the mix, the internet exploded. Soon enough, it constituted a vast spider’s web of user-created content, all connected by hyperlinks. Later developments perpetuated the spirit of the internet’s early days. Even now, there isn’t a single central authority controlling individual nodes. The web of connections is regulated only by its users, who are free to add and delete links as they please. That not only means that there isn’t a map of the internet, but that it’s literally unmappable! Like the printing press before it, the internet has become a vector for contagious ideas. And just like books, the price of computers has fallen rapidly in a short period of time. One of the twenty-first century’s defining moments occurred just a year after its dawn. On September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks targeted the central nodes of America’s economic and political system. And the perpetrators belonged to a network – the al-Qaeda group. But network analysis showed that the terrorists who conducted the attack had few weak ties. In fact, just one man – Mohammed Atta – served as the crucial node within the group. With connections to 16 of the 19 hijackers, and to 15 other important people outside the group, Atta had the highest betweenness centrality. The American response to the attacks wasn’t long in coming. As well as targeting al-Qaeda directly in Afghanistan, the United States sought to topple Saddam Hussein’s hierarchical dictatorship in Iraq. That created a vacuum in the country – a vacuum soon filled by new Islamist networks. With the dictatorship gone, they now found that they could operate more freely. But that hasn’t been the only network-driven change in the Middle East. Other networks have since deployed technology to change the face of the region. The Arab Spring kicked off in North Africa before spreading to other countries such as Syria. Social-media platforms, particularly Twitter and Facebook, played a vital role in getting the word out in struggles against the region’s hierarchical dictatorships. As old regimes crumbled, new networks emerged. Islamic State or ISIS is perhaps the most well-known of these. ISIS has made use of an open network, as well as sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, to spread its message and make its ideology go viral. Networks like those used by ISIS work like a swarm. By using countless social-media accounts simultaneously, the network can avoid losing access due to account closures. That applies as much to the real world as it does to its online presence. The Obama administration pursued a decapitation strategy against the group but, like the Hydra of ancient Greek myth, it seemed to grow two new heads for every one it lost. This strategy didn’t work because it applied to a network the rules of engagement that’d proven effective against hierarchical organizations. And as we’ll see in the next blink, this mistake was made outside the Middle East as well. Hierarchies haven’t just come under sustained pressure in the Middle East. Since 2016, a wave of unrest has also destabilized familiar top-down institutions in the West. And, once again, social media proved a powerful engine of disruption. That’s because social media is a great tool if you want to polarize opinion. Most social media users are ensconced in close-knit, homophilic networks, especially when it comes to politics. They inhabit a space in which they’re used to hearing views they agree with – that’s par for the course in an “echo chamber.” But what happens if you can find a way into these closed networks and start spreading your message there? Well, it’s a bit like putting a fox in the henhouse. It gets people moving. For a successful example of this, take the recent “Brexit” referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union (EU). The pro-Brexit Vote Leave group knew that it was at a severe disadvantage when Prime Minister David Cameron called the referendum. Most of the established hierarchical institutions in the United Kingdom were strongly in favor of the country remaining in the European Union. However, Dominic Cummings, the mastermind behind Vote Leave, saw an opening for his side of the debate. He now claims that one of the main reasons Vote Leave triumphed was the targeted advertisements used to push key messages on social media channels. These messages included the supposedly imminent accession of Turkey to the European Union and the promise that leaving would free up £350 million a week for the National Health Service (NHS). Almost a billion of these messages were sent out across different channels prior to the referendum, reaching a vast number of potential voters and their networks. Vote Leave’s opponents, by contrast, were almost entirely focused on traditional campaigning techniques. It became clear which strategy was more effective when, in June 2016, the country voted to leave the European Union. Across the Atlantic, another outsider was harnessing the power of social media to storm the castle of political power: Donald Trump. His success, like that of Vote Leave, was a product of a simple but vital fact: most of us rely on social media for our news. In the United States, around half the population gets its news from Facebook feeds alone. That placed Trump perfectly to make his run for the presidency. Not only were his social-media accounts much bigger than Hillary Clinton’s, with 32 percent more followers on Twitter and 87 percent more on Facebook, he was also much more likely to trend than she was. While Clinton was getting around 1,500 retweets per tweet, Trump was racking up around 6,000! That might seem slightly surprising. After all, Clinton attracted a larger share of younger, urban and well-educated voters – all demographics you’d think were more likely to be internet savvy, right? Well, this is where things get interesting. Social-media campaigns are most effective when they move offline – when people start discussing tweets or posts in the real world, at bars or social gatherings, with people outside their online networks. But, for that to happen, they have to be interesting or shocking enough to go viral. The Clinton campaign’s problem was that her posts just weren’t provocative enough to make that leap. Trump’s were. And in that regard, he followed the trail blazed by Cummings’s Vote Leave campaign. As we’ve seen, networks and revolutions have long been bedfellows. But what does that mean for us, the inhabitants of the most networked societies in human history? Well, thanks to the internet we might just be on the cusp of an age every bit as revolutionary as that which followed the invention of the printing press. The analogy is striking, but there are a couple of differences. First off, the internet has spread much more swiftly than printed books and literacy did in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Consider this extraordinary fact. In 1998, only 2 percent of the world’s population was online. A mere twenty years later, that percentage stood around 40! And the fortunes of the two technologies’ pioneering figures could hardly be more different. Whereas the likes of Mark Zuckerberg have become billionaires, Johann Gutenberg went bankrupt. The rise of the internet may have given birth to romantic visions of knowledge’ democratization, but things haven’t quite panned out that way. Technology has instead become an oligopoly in which large American companies enjoy absolute dominance. While Facebook, Amazon and Google proclaim their commitment to an open internet, they’ve taken every possible step to ensure that their position in the market is unassailable. That means that new networks are less open than they could be. And, as we’ve already seen, they can be manipulated and used to spread fake news during elections. Russian trolls and terrorists like ISIS have also shown how effective these networks can be as channels for their propaganda. So what’s the solution? One good place to start would be to reconcile hierarchies and networks. Take globalization. While the economy is now truly global, the nation state remains the base of political power. Without reconciling these two aspects of the contemporary world, there’s a danger that unrest will lead to a populist backlash and a turn toward authoritarianism. Cyberspace is another unregulated region. It resembles nothing so much as the physical world before the establishment of states and laws. A precise recipe is hard to come by, but the relative peace of the nineteenth century when the pentarchy ran the show could provide a blueprint. More regulated networks might help us navigate our own turbulent era. The key message in these blinks: We live in an age of networks and networking. But that’s nothing new. From the invention of the printing press in fifteenth-century Europe to the Enlightenment and all the way up to the election of Donald Trump, technology-driven networks have spread radical new ideas, destabilized existing hierarchies and shaped the history of the world.

Each pillar has a different role. The state guarantees law and order as well as providing the infrastructure that makes social life possible. Markets provide an outlet for ingenuity and wealth creation. Finally, communities create a sense of attachment, identity and solidarity. But societies only create the conditions for human flourishing when each of these three supports is equally strong – undermine one pillar and the whole structure begins to look pretty shaky. That balance has been historically elusive. Medieval society had strong communities but lacked both a state and markets. Commercial nations in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, on the other hand, had thriving marketplaces but sorely lacked a state capable of creating a level playing field. Today, we’re suffering from our own imbalances. After the failure of the state-driven models, which delivered unprecedented growth in the wake of the Second World War, Western societies attempted to construct a new order that emphasized efficiency and profit-making. The result? Inequality has exploded, creating a resentful class poorly equipped to deal with the challenges of globalization. That, in turn, has fuelled the great anti-establishment crusade of today’s populists. But as Raghuram Rajan shows, it doesn’t have to be this way. In these blinks, we’ll explore his blueprint for a better and more balanced world. Along the way, you’ll learn how the nation-state eventually replaced the medieval social order; why China will have to rethink its current economic model; and what an Indian city struggling with littering can teach us about localism. Medieval Europe was a patchwork quilt of self-governing manors owned by the continent’s leading noble families. Peasants pledged allegiance to their masters and paid taxes. In return, they were permitted to work part of their land. The manors were self-contained communities governed by lords, who settled disputes among tenants and saw that justice was done. Goods produced on these estates were traded internally rather than exported. All in all, it was a social arrangement dominated by the community pillar. The fact that the medieval Church prohibited usury – the practice of charging interests on loans – cemented the sense of community felt by the inhabitants of manors. Rather than being given in the expectation of a monetary reward, help was a social obligation: people gave each other a hand knowing that their neighbors would return the favor. In the fifteenth century, technological developments disturbed this social order. Why? Well, innovations like the siege cannon changed the rules of the game. If you wanted to survive, you needed enough cash to fund a large army and defensive structures. Small manors just didn’t have the means to do that, so enterprising rulers began combining their estates. By the end of the century, the number of sovereign entities in Europe had halved to just 500. This was the beginning of a new era – the age of nation states. These new states eventually became so powerful that they eclipsed the Church, an institution whose laws had traditionally been seen as trumping secular law. When Henry VIII ascended to the English throne in 1485, for example, he was determined to expand his kingdom’s military prowess. He made up for shortfalls in his budget by seizing Catholic monasteries and selling their lands to lower status nobles. The most astute investors in these former Church properties became known as the “gentry” – an entrepreneurial agricultural class that invested in the productivity of their holdings and used the profits to buy up even more land. By the end of the sixteenth century, states had come into their own. Monarchs ruled a unified people and levied taxes on the gentry to cover the costs of increasingly expensive wars. The state was in the ascendance but, as we’ll see in the next blink, it’s dominance would soon be challenged by the market. The golden age of the state lasted from the consolidation of nation-states at the end of the fifteenth century until the late sixteenth. That’s when a new rival emerged to challenge their power: the market. Unproductive land previously owned by the aristocracy and the Church gradually fell into the hands of the commercially minded gentry. Monarchs were happy enough with this development – after all, the wealthier the gentry became, the higher their tax revenues were. But this new class also extracted its own price: greater freedom. One of the most important moments in this shifting relationship came in 1688, when English Parliamentarians deposed King James II and replaced him with a more pliant monarch, William of Orange. This event became known as the Glorious Revolution. Liberated from overweening royals, the gentry flourished. As the state receded, the market pillar became central to the lives of European nations. Philosophers sang the praises of the market. Adam Smith’s 1776 treatise The Wealth of Nations, for example, argued that the “invisible hand” of competitive markets allowed manufacturers – and thus nations – to flourish. What Smith hadn’t seen coming were the so-called “robber barons” of late nineteenth-century America who abused these newfound freedoms. Take John D. Rockefeller, an industrialist who became the world’s richest man by ruthlessly eliminating competition to his oil refining business. How? In a word, cartels. Rockefeller cut a deal with railroads in Cleveland so that they would charge his competitors a fee for transporting their oil barrels, which were then passed on to Rockefeller. In return, they received a share of Rockefeller’s own oil profits! Dodgy dealing like Rockefeller’s provoked a public backlash, and legislators withdrew Rockefeller’s main shell company’s charter. Poorly paid workers toiling in industrialists’ exploitative factories were meanwhile beginning to speak up for their rights, demanding better representation in government. Their pressure paid off. By the early twentieth century, most Western countries had expanded the right to vote to male workers. After centuries of retreat, the community pillar was once again returning to the forefront of social and economic life. The free market held out even as arguments in favor of stricter regulation became more common, but following the stock market crash of 1929 it suffered what looked like a killer blow – the Great Depression. States cast around for a culprit for the global crisis. The rampant capitalism of the previous decades seemed to fit the bill, and governments soon rushed through anti-market measures. The Smoot–Hawley Act, for example, which raised tariffs on over 20,000 import products, was passed in the US in 1930. Full recovery, however, had to wait until the outbreak of the Second World War. Spurred on by the huge demand created by mobilization, Western economies finally clawed their way out of the recession. But it was in the postwar era that they really took off. The first three decades after the conclusion of the war witnessed a period of unprecedented growth. Between 1946 and 1975, average real income per person grew by around 6.0 percent every year in Germany and 4.2 percent in France. That newfound prosperity allowed governments to make grand promises to their voters. Take Britain – in 1946, the Labour government created the National Health Service, the universal healthcare system that still provides coverage to UK citizens today. The creation of welfare states wasn’t the only outcome of dramatic economic growth. Immigration also exploded, as former belligerents sought to plug holes in their labor forces with foreign workers. By 1973, one in nine workers in France had been overseas. In West Germany, it was one in eight. The miracle couldn’t last, however, and by the 1960s Western economies were beginning to look shaky. That’s when the problems began. Government deficits increased as their spending commitments outstripped GDP growth. And as economies slowed down, unemployment and inflation rates began skyrocketing. Something had to give. The US and the UK led the way. Their answer? Roll back the state through deregulation and the privatization of state-owned industries. That meant a showdown with workers’ movements, but both the American and British governments proved adept at crushing resistance. In 1981, Ronald Reagan fired 11,000 unionized air traffic controllers and banned them from ever working for the federal government again. In the UK, Margaret Thatcher meanwhile waged a grueling but ultimately successful one-year war against striking coal miners, closing down their mines. The result of such conflicts was that the relationship between the three pillars once again swung in the market’s favor. As we’ll see, that wasn’t good news for communities. The expansion of markets from the 1980s onwards meant that the maximization of shareholder value gradually displaced other aims. Take corporations. In the 1960s, large businesses were commonly expected to contribute to society as a whole. A decade later, that view had fallen into disfavor as influential economists like Milton Friedman argued that the only “social responsibility” of business was “to increase its profits.” Friedman’s argument was simple. If managers focused on maximizing profits and the value of shareholders’ shares, their companies would survive and contribute more to society in the long run. The best way of aligning the interests of shareholders and managers, Friedman argued, was to make their pay – ideally in stocks – dependant on performance. That would incentivize them to do everything in their power to boost share value, including laying off workers. This new ethos was brilliant at encouraging efficiency, but it also led to greater inequality. The pay gap between the highest and lowest levels of organizations widened, while the positions of those at the bottom of the ladder became ever more precarious. These changes weren’t just the product of new ideas, however – technological innovation also played its role. As the author sees it, technological developments have created a “winner-takes most” economy, in which a small pool of superstars end up with most of the cake while the rest have to make do with crumbs. The music industry is a case in point. Today, anyone with a smartphone is seconds away from their favorite musician’s latest heavily hyped videos. The empires and unprecedented fortunes of a select few depend on that technology. Without it, it’s highly unlikely that Taylor Swift would’ve made $170 million in 2016. Less well-known musicians like the singer-songwriters who play in local bars, however, lose out. It’s easier and cheaper to listen to the biggest names of the day than supporting smaller acts. The music industry isn’t the only sector that’s been transformed by technological innovation – in fact, labor markets as a whole are being shaken up by new tech. This cuts two ways, as established jobs are being eliminated while new positions are being opened up. But here’s the problem: there’s a huge gap between the winners and losers of such change. Menial jobs like assembly line work are currently being decimated by automation. That means job losses for less-skilled workers, but it also creates new niche positions for specialists capable of overseeing automated processes and correcting errors. The folks who’ll fill those positions are invariably highly educated and at home in increasingly globalized labor markets. The workers whose jobs are being automated out of existence, by contrast, aren’t prepared for that kind of competition. That’s not just an issue affecting blue-collar workers, however – even moderately well-educated workers in developed countries have to compete with ever better-equipped overseas competitors. Outsourcing means that companies can transfer tasks to newly educated workforces in developing countries who can do the same work for a fraction of the cost. Inequalities created in the workplace are exacerbated by residential sorting – the tendency of wealthy families to live together in affluent neighborhoods. That’s driven by their desire to access the best schools and give their kids a head start in life. But as wealthy families flock to zip codes with high-achieving schools, prices increase and poorer families are driven out. The result? Social stratification. That’s a political powder keg. Moderately educated groups have become increasingly resentful of their elite peers in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. What lit the fuse in the US, however, was Obamacare. The conviction that the Democrats’ healthcare reforms were a handout to minorities and ignored the interests of tax-paying blue-collar households led to the creation of the populist Tea Party movement. In Europe, it was the 2015 immigration crisis that triggered a populist backlash. After Germany admitted over one million refugees from war-torn countries in the Muslim world, voters anxious about their culture and welfare systems took aim at the EU – the institution they blamed for limiting their ability to control population movements. In the UK, those sentiments fed into the decision to leave the EU in 2016. The future of developed nations can’t be separated from that of so-called emerging nations. Whether it’s immigration or the export of high-tech goods and investments, the fate of both groups of countries are interlinked. That’s something policymaking in emerging nations will have to take into account. So what needs to be done? Well, let’s look at two case studies – China and India. China’s recent economic gains are impressive. Between 1980 and 2015, the country’s annual GDP growth averaged out 8.7 percent every year. That expansion was mostly driven by a couple of key, state-owned businesses. These companies were given access to guaranteed cheap credit and subsidized inputs like steel by the government, which in turn funded such largesse through taxes on regular households and foreign investment. Recent shifts in global markets and a return to protectionism mean that foreign firms are no longer interested in investing in Chinese production markets to export to other parts of the world. Instead, they’re focused on selling their own goods in China’s booming consumer market. That, in turn, means that China’s future growth will have to be domestic – something it will only be able to achieve if it eliminates the kind of market-distorting measures that have previously been used to give state-owned enterprises an artificial advantage. Can China liberalize its markets while maintaining central party control? That’s the big question facing the nation. India – a vast democracy with one billion inhabitants, 22 official languages and some 700 dialects – faces a different issue: corruption. So far that hasn’t hampered its economic growth. Over the last 25 years, India averaged 7.0 percent annual GDP growth. But it is undermining democracy. In the early 2000s, for example, it was revealed that government officials had been selling state assets, including land and mineral deposits, to their cronies at a steep discount. That’s indicative of the entanglement of the state and markets. If India wants to thrive, it’ll need to cut those ties and encourage a more independent private sector. But here’s the issue. The rise of a Hindu populism that promises to use the state to protect Hindu identity threatens to reverse the progress of liberalization just as it becomes more important than ever. As we’ve seen, the three pillars of our economies – state, market and community – are out of balance. The power of markets has eroded communities, while the state is increasingly identified with an out-of-touch establishment. That’s a recipe for populism. Why? Well, populism claims to offer a solution to the problems caused by such imbalances. On the one hand, it promises to revitalize society’s sense of community by bolstering national identity along ethnic and class lines. On the other hand, it proposes economic measures like tariffs on imported commodities like steel to counteract the erosion of job security. But these policies are ultimately counterproductive, undermining both domestic economies and international relations. Antagonizing today’s minorities will also lead to future retaliation when the identity of the majority group changes, as it inevitably will. So what’s the alternative? Call it inclusive localism. While the details will vary from country to country, all variants of inclusive localism share a common feature: the decentralization of power. That’s essentially all about delegating as many responsibilities as possible from the state to local communities, giving them the power to decide their own economic and political fates. In practice it would mean that, say, a small town could decide whether it prefers chains like Walmart, or would rather reserve its retail space for local businesses. Communities would also be empowered to preserve the traditions they value. What it doesn’t mean is an archipelago of isolated communities fending for themselves. That’s where the “inclusive” part comes in. The state’s role in this arrangement is to help bridge the gap between individual communities. That can take a couple of forms. Most literally, it will build concrete bridges; more generally, it will provide communications infrastructure as well as encouraging mobility through legislative action, especially for lower-income families. Take schools. One way the state can facilitate social mobility is to make use of already existent digital technologies to create a new national curriculum of lectures, reading materials and assignments available to every child. Affluent parents would no longer need to flock to wealthy neighborhoods with the best schools and poorer children would have access to the same education as their better-off peers. Teachers would meanwhile play a coaching role and use classroom time to motivate children with projects better suited to their individual needs and interests. Reviving local communities won’t be easy – in fact, it’ll take sustained work, inspired leadership and enthusiastic engagement. But it is possible, as a number of communities have already proven. Take Indore in Madhya Pradesh, India. When Malini Gaud was elected as the mayor of Indore in 2015, the city was in a bad way. Locals were using the city center as an open trash can while stray dogs, pigs and cows roamed the streets eating from the mountains of discarded trash and defecating in the gutters. Gaud was determined to change this sorry state of affairs. Her first act? Sprucing up the municipal cleaning team’s image. Workers were given new uniforms and their old rickshaws were replaced with state-of-the-art trucks fitted with GPS. Gaud also introduced biometric attendance tracking, suspended 300 underperforming employees and fired another 600. The revamped services got to work and began collecting household trash every day. The difference was stark and appreciative locals agreed to a new monthly collection fee, offsetting the costs of Gaud’s investments in municipal cleaning services. The introduction of fines, meanwhile, encouraged local eateries and shops to install bins. Gaud’s most inventive move was to create “drum squads” to patrol the streets and create an attention-grabbing racket every time they spotted someone using public spaces as their personal toilet. By 2017, Indore was ranked as the cleanest city in India. Even better, residents felt proud of their community and were united in a common effort to keep their streets clean. But how will these projects be funded? Well, in most cases, private sources like philanthropists and financial institutions with an interest in supporting local businesses will provide the bulk of the funding. That can work in different ways. If a community needs to provide equity for loans, for example, it can lease assets – a local park, say, could double up as a corporate event location after closing hours. The government also has a role to play. One idea is a system of top-ups subsidizing low earners’ incomes. These could be tied to community service, encouraging engagement and offering less affluent citizens a valuable source of additional income. Inclusive localism will require states to take a back seat and cede control to communities. At the national and international levels, however, they need to promote fair competition and innovation, as well as ensuring that markets aren’t dominated by a small number of overly powerful corporations. The best place to start when it comes to the state’s regulatory roles is to reform data rights laws. Take e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Amazon. Currently, these companies own the online transaction histories of the merchants who use their services. That gives them valuable data concerning businesses’ cash flow and allows them to assess whether they’re eligible for loans. Over time these platforms develop a monopoly over users’ transaction and credit histories. Eventually, no one else has access to the hard data necessary to calculate credit scores. The upshot? They’re the only providers of credit in the market, allowing them to charge hefty interest fees and further consolidate their economic power. That’s not fair. The alternative? Give individuals ownership of their own data and allow them to decide who to share it with. Internationally, states need to find the right balance between global trade and national sovereignty. Keeping tariffs as low as possible, at least for goods and services, is in everyone’s interests. That said, governments should resist the urge to harmonize non-tariff barriers like regulations and safety standards if they want to protect diversity and national sovereignty. Financial trade, by contrast, should be more tightly regulated – after all, no one wants a repeat of the 2008 crisis. The same goes for information flows, in an age of increasing cybercrime and social media meddling. Finally, states should exercise full sovereignty over domestic issues like monetary policy. Policies that affect other nations such as the manipulation of exchange rates, by contrast, should be prohibited by the international community. Other areas requiring joint action like overfishing and carbon emissions should be regulated through global agreements. Globalization has its benefits, but it needs to be managed. The best way of doing that is to delegate sovereignty to countries and their communities so that they can pursue their own interests without harming others. Inclusive localism provides a template for how they might be able to do just that. The key message in these blinks: The central pillars of our society are out of balance. Rising inequalities and growing class resentment are undermining communities around the world. This is fertile ground for populist insurgents. But their ideal of state-backed nationalism doesn’t hold the answers to the complex problems posed by globalization and technological innovation. If we want to avoid being led up the garden path, we need to come up with a solution that balances the three pillars of social life – the state, markets and communities. The best option we have of aligning those three pillars is inclusive localism.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content! Just drop an email to remember@blinkist.com with the title of this book as the subject line and share your thoughts. What to read next: Fault Lines, by Raghuram G. Rajan The 2008 financial crisis had far-reaching consequences. As we’ve seen in these blinks, the tide of populism currently sweeping the world has its roots in that great global crash. That means we’d better figure out how to avoid a repeat of those disastrous years if we want a return to political stability. That’s just what Raghuram Rajan set out to do in his study of the financial crisis. Unsatisfied with the simplistic argument that greedy bankers tanked the global economy, Rajan unravels the complex interplay of structural and individual factors underpinning the worst crash since the Great Depression. So if you’d like to learn more about preventing another crisis, check out our blinks to Fault Lines, by Raghuram Rajan.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Dubner","summary":"Have you ever made a particular choice just because everyone around you seemed to support it? How often have you found yourself repeating an argument you came across in the media, even though you haven’t really thought it through? We’re often restricted by conventional wisdom about how the world works. Moreover, this kind of popular belief is especially limiting when it comes to decision making and problem solving. Think Like A Freak, from the authors of Freakonomics, aims to solve this particular problem by showing the world, one reader at a time, how to think unconventionally – “a bit differently, a bit harder, a bit more freely”, as the authors put it. In these blinks, you’ll learn to see the world as no one else does, and, in doing so, to find solutions that you would not have otherwise considered. In short, these blinks will show you how to think like a freak. Along the way you’ll also find out: why kids are harder to fool than adults when it comes to magic tricks, why you should never depend on the predictions of an expert, how a skinny college student won the world’s biggest hotdog-eating championship, doubling the previous record and how the legalization of abortion in the 1970s led to a massive drop in crime in the 1990s. When we try to solve problems, most of us are guided by conventional beliefs. However, there’s a problem with conventional beliefs: they’re often wrong. Take, for example, the “local food” movement. Most people believe that consuming local food reduces environmental impact. However, a recent study found that this movement was actually counterproductive because the small farms it supports consume more energy for production, outweighing any positive effects of reduced transportation. This is exactly what thinking like a freak is about: basing one's beliefs and decisions on statistical evidence, rather than conventional wisdom. But how can this be of use in everyday life? Well, for one thing, thinking like a freak can help you to solve problems. For example, imagine you’re a soccer player about to make a penalty kick which could win your team the World Cup. How can you increase your chances of scoring? If you’re right-footed, as most players are, aiming towards the left will result in a stronger, more accurate kick. Goalkeepers are aware of this strategy, so 57 percent of the time they’ll jump to the kicker’s left side, and 41 percent to the right. Interestingly, however, keepers remain in the goal’s center only two percent of the time, so a kick “straight up the middle” is seven percent more likely to be successful than a kick to either corner. But while thinking like a freak has many advantages, it might also put your popularity at risk. For example, only 17 percent of all penalties in professional soccer are aimed towards the center. Why? Because it’s such an obvious violation of the conventions. Also, if the goalkeeper remains in the center and catches the ball with zero effort, the penalty-taker might well lose the faith of his fans. Or, for example, imagine how popular you’ll be when you tell a “locavore” friend that the local-food movement actually hurts the environment! Many of us find it hard to admit if we don’t know something. Instead of confessing our lack of knowledge, we are overconfident and pretend we know something when actually we don’t. In terms of overconfidence, consider the fact that when asked to rate their driving skills, roughly 80 percent of people rated themselves as “above average”, even though – by definition – just 49.99 percent of them can be above-average drivers. Also, people fake knowledge of a subject because they don’t want to appear stupid. So they nod and smile, even if they don’t understand what’s being said, or they pass off the opinions they’ve read in the newspaper as their own. But the truth is that admitting that you don’t know something has its advantages. For one, it can actually increase your credibility. If you’re known as someone who owns up to their lack of knowledge, people are more likely to trust you when you claim that you do know something. Another advantage is that, by maintaining an awareness of what you don’t yet know, you can learn and, eventually, figure out the truth. One group of people who rarely admit a lack of knowledge are experts, as they’re highly likely to bluff it when they’re not sure. For that reason, we should be careful not to trust them blindly. For instance, we often base our decisions on the predictions of experts – e.g., when deciding which stock to invest in – but there are reasons why we shouldn’t do this. Firstly, they have the motivations to fake knowledge: experts who make bold predictions that turn out to be accurate might be celebrated for years, but, if those predictions are wrong, they’ll probably be forgotten. Secondly, experts are actually terrible at making predictions. One study even calculated the rate of accuracy of stock-market experts’ predictions to be just 47.4 percent – worse odds than you’d get by simply flipping a coin! Whenever the media focuses on a single aspect of a problem – for instance, on the ethnic background of a criminal – rather than considering a host of other relevant factors, their arguments tend to determine public discourse. However, since public discussion can cause us to overlook other, more fruitful approaches, we should try to look beyond the media’s focus. Take, for example, the American education crisis, where the discussion is focused on the schooling system and on topics such as teachers’ skills and class size. Obviously, making improvements in these two areas would help to improve children’s performance in school, but in fact many studies argue that factors such as teachers’ skills have much less influence on schoolchildren’s performance than parenting does. The best approach, therefore, would be to focus attention on questions like: What have children learned from their parents? And, has an appetite for learning been established? Yet because the media focuses on a single aspect of the problem – “what’s wrong with our schools” – we overlook the initial question: why do American kids usually know less than those from many other countries? By focusing on the original problem, we’re able to identify other aspects of the situation and to arrive at effective solutions. In addition to looking beyond the public discourse, it can sometimes help to redefine the problem. For example, when Kobi – a slim Japanese student – first entered the world’s biggest hotdog-eating competition, none of his competitors saw him as a threat. But Kobi didn’t just win the contest. He doubled the previous record, consuming 50 hotdogs! How? He redefined the problem – from “How can I eat more?” to “How do I make hotdogs easier to eat?” This led Kobi to invent new techniques, such as dunking the buns in water and eating them separately from the sausages, which turned out to be his key to success. Finding the root cause of a problem is always a challenge. So what’s the best strategy to get you there? A particularly useful approach is to think “outside the box.” What does this entail? Consider the following example. In their bestseller, Freakonomics, authors Levitt and Dubner examined possible causes of the dramatic fall in violent crime since the 1990s. By looking at a statistical analysis, they found that the influence of things like an increased police presence was too small to account for the drop as a whole. So what was the missing factor? By chance, Levitt recalled a statistic about the dramatic increase in abortions after its nationwide legalization in the 1970s, and after some statistical analysis, he found that this was related to the drop in crime. While this may sound quite absurd, there’s actually a simple explanation: the increase in abortions in the 1970s resulted in fewer births of unwanted children, which in turn meant that fewer children were growing up in the kinds of difficult circumstances that often lead to criminality. In addition to employing outside-the-box thinking when searching for a problem’s root cause, you should also ensure that you don’t mistake a symptom for a cause. For example, consider this question: What are the causes of poverty and famine? At first glance, the answer seems obvious: the lack of money and food. However, if that were true, why has the problem persisted despite the constant efforts of aid groups and governments to allocate money and food to poor regions? The reason is that poverty and famine are symptoms of another problem: the absence of a workable economy and credible political, social, and legal institutions. In many ways, thinking like a freak means thinking like a child. For example, imagine that you’re a professional magician. Which audience would you prefer: kids or adults? While you might think it’s far easier to impress children with magic, kids are actually a far more challenging audience. Why? Because kids are curious and therefore more difficult to deceive. As professional magician Alex Stone – an expert on misdirection – argues, there are several reasons for this. One reason is that adults are good at focusing their attention on one thing. Though you might consider this an advantage, focus – while essential to getting things done – can leave you vulnerable to misdirection. Kids, on the other hand, are more curious, and try to see an illusion from different angles. The result is that they tend to notice essential aspects that adults overlook, which leads them to discover how the trick works. Certain other behaviors associated with children – having fun and confronting the obvious – are also important for all of us. Why is this? Firstly, if you have fun doing your work, you’ll want to do more of it. Also, research shows that engagement in what you’re doing is the best predictor for future success. Secondly, confronting the obvious – asking questions that others usually don’t – can lead to all kinds of insights. For example, the discovery (mentioned in the previous blink) of a link between the legalization of abortion and the 1990s drop in violent crime resulted from a chance observation of a huge statistical increase in abortions immediately following their 1970s legalization. While most people think about abortion in political or moral terms only, and would never suspect it might be related to other social phenomena, those who are in touch with their “inner child” would respond to such a statistical spike with wonder and curiosity: “What a huge increase. That must’ve had an effect on something!” The key to understanding problems and arriving at solutions is to understand how incentives direct our behavior. In an experiment that psychologist Robert Cialdini conducted to determine the strongest incentive for people to save energy, participants were instructed to rate the relative influence of four factors on their decision to conserve energy. Cialdini found that the most important factor was protection of the environment. The second most important factor was that energy conservation benefits society. The third factor was that it saves money. And the lowest-ranked factor of the four was that other people are doing it. But do these incentives hold water in real life? To find out, Cialdini’s research team went from house to house in a Californian neighborhood and hung placards with messages to save energy by using a fan rather than air-conditioning in summer. Five versions of the cards were randomly distributed among the residents. One had a neutral headline, and the others had headlines which matched one of the four incentives above. Because the researchers were able to measure the actual energy use of each home, they could see which of the placards was the most effective. The winner? Surprisingly, it was the card that appealed to the \"herd-mentality\" incentive. So, in actuality, the factor that was ranked as least important in the survey – “other people are doing it” – turned out to be the strongest incentive for conserving energy. What can we learn from this? If you want to change an individual’s behavior, telling them that “too many people are wasting energy – that needs to stop!” is a wrong-headed approach because the underlying message is that “many people like you are doing this, so it can't be that bad.” A more effective public service message would be: “Everyone is interested in saving energy – what about you?” Usually, a person who is lying or cheating will respond differently to a given incentive than an honest person would – a fact that can be used to distinguish the good guys from the bad. How? By employing certain strategies, such as faking cruelty, you can make people reveal their true intentions. Consider this example from the Bible: Two women came to King Solomon with a dilemma. Both of them lived in the same house and each had recently given birth to a boy. The first woman claimed that the second had exchanged the babies when she was sleeping, after the second woman's child had died. The second women denied this. King Solomon told the women that, in order to resolve the matter, he’d divide the child in two with a sword and give one half to each of them. The first women begged him not to hurt the baby and to instead give it to the second woman, who didn’t object. The king reasoned that a true mother would love her child too much to accept the killing, while a woman able to steal another's baby out of jealousy would be content with such a solution. Another illustrative example comes from real life. Van Halen – one of the biggest rock bands ever – were famous for their demanding attitude. In the “Munchies” section of their rider, they requested M&M’s, with the proviso “WARNING: ABSOLUTELY NO BROWN ONES.\" At first glance, this might seem an example of rock star excess, but it was actually a strategic move. Van Halen's live show required strict safety measures. The only way for them to be certain that a local promoter had read all of their instructions thoroughly was to check whether the bowl of M&M’s backstage included any brown ones. If it did, the rest of the equipment would need to be very carefully checked. The band understood that promoters driven by “easy money” would overlook the passage about the M&Ms, while those motivated by professionalism would not. You’ve probably noticed that when you challenge someone’s common sense, you often encounter disagreement. So what can you do to persuade your opponents? First, acknowledge that persuasion is difficult because people tend to ignore facts that don’t fit their worldview. For example, despite the fact that the vast majority of climate scientists believe that global warming will probably lead to worrisome changes for our environment, the American public is not very concerned. Why? In one study, researchers from the Cultural Cognition Project suspected that people aren’t worried simply because they’re not scientifically literate enough to understand the arguments of climate scientists. However, when they tested their hypothesis, they couldn’t find any association between scientific literacy and concern about climate change. But they did find another interesting pattern. Scientifically literate people were actually more likely to hold an extreme opinion – e.g., that climate change is extremely worrisome or totally insignificant. Their high level of confidence in their position probably stemmed from a good general knowledge and from having had more experience with feeling they’re “in the right” than lay people. Also, their higher level of education enabled them to find evidence that proves their point while simultaneously blocking out any opposing arguments. So even if you have excellent arguments and statistical evidence, you should expect persuasion to be difficult. What’s certain is that, in order to persuade someone, you’ll first have to get her to listen. This means respecting her point of view and then telling her a story. Since people tend to be overconfident in their own views and mistrust opposing ones, it’s best not to pretend that your argument is watertight. Instead, acknowledge the strengths of your opponent’s argument and explain how you still arrived at the opposite point of view. Also, catchy stories are often the best tool to prove your point; stories are simply harder to ignore and forget than abstract details. Not only does thinking like a freak help us to problem solve, it can also make us happier. How? Most well-meaning, conventional advice is actually counterproductive when it comes to happiness, so do yourself a favor and don’t pay it too much attention. One popular mantra that is actually bad advice: a winner never quits, and a quitter never wins. Why is this bad advice? Because there are already enough forces which bias us against quitting. Even when quitting is clearly the better choice, we often hesitate to do it. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, social pressure: we have been taught that quitting is a weak thing to do. Secondly, sunk costs: the more we invest in something, the more reluctant we are to quit. This is also known as the “Concorde Fallacy,” after the supersonic airplane. Everyone involved knew that the project wasn’t economically viable, but hesitated to quit because they’d already invested so much money. The result? They ultimately lost a lot more money than they would have had they quit sooner. Thirdly, we tend to forget the opportunity costs: We often overlook the fact that, by engaging in one thing, we also forgo the opportunity to do something else. However, if we manage to let go of conventional wisdoms such as the “winner never quits” dogma, we allow ourselves to become much happier. In order to investigate how certain decisions affect happiness, the authors set up a website on which people faced with a difficult decision could flip a virtual coin. After some months, the participants were asked whether they’d acted upon the coin flip and to gauge their happiness level. Surprisingly, two major decisions to quit left people happier: breaking up with one’s partner and quitting one’s job. Of course, this doesn’t mean that people would be better off quitting more jobs or relationships, but there’s nothing in the data to suggest that quitting leads to misery either. The key message in this book: Conventional wisdom is often wrong, and challenging popular dogmas can give you a better understanding of how things work. Learning how to think like a freak can help you to explore the hidden sides of problems, leading to surprising and effective solutions. Curiosity and the inclination to think outside the box are crucial ingredients for achieving this mindset.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Meadows","summary":"You probably already know that your body is a system. Your blood is rushing about your veins because of your pumping heart, your kidneys remove waste from your blood, your lungs enable you to breathe and so on. In other words: your body consists of various organs held together by their respective relationships, serving the purpose of keeping you going. But how about a soccer team? A company? Are they systems too? Of course! Systems are everywhere – though some are more obvious than others. These blinks take you on a journey into the world of systems. They’ll explain what systems are, where to find them, and how they work and sustain themselves. In these blinks, you’ll learn why feedback is key to systems; how a system can be corrupt; and why you shouldn’t expect that putting 20 pounds of fertilizer on your field will yield four bushels of wheat just because ten pounds of fertilizer yielded two bushels. Have you ever paused and tried to identify the different systems around you? If you did, you’d quickly notice that they’re just about everywhere – from your body to your favorite football team to the company you work for and the city you live in.  That’s because a system is simply a group of elements, connected by relationships and paired with a purpose. These elements can be visible and physical, but they can also be intangible. For instance, while you can both see and touch the roots, branches and leaves of a tree, things like academic prowess in a university are more amorphous.  But whether they’re physical or not, all elements of a system are held together by relationships. For instance, in the system of a tree, the relationships connecting the elements are metabolic processes and chemical reactions. In the system of a university they might be standards for admission, examinations and grades.  And the purpose of a system? That’s defined by the system’s observed behavior, not its stated goals. For instance, a government might say that it has a goal of environmental protection, but not put its money where its mouth is. Therefore, environmental protection is not the government’s purpose as it isn’t reflected by what it actually does.  It’s important to know that the relationships and purpose of a system will always determine it, even if its elements change. A football team might acquire an entirely new roster, but its relationships between positions and unified purpose of winning games are the same. Furthermore, the behavior of a system breaks down into stocks and flows, which change over time.  Here’s how they each work. Stocks are the elements of a system that can be accounted for at any given time. For instance, water in a bathtub, books in a store or money in a bank. On the other hand, flow is the change in stock over time as a result of inflows, which add, and outflows, which subtract. Examples of these are births and deaths or purchases and sales.  So, now you know about the stocks and flows of a system, but it’s essential also to understand that they’re constantly changing. That’s because when changes in stock affect the inflows and outflows of a system it’s considered to have a feedback. What’s more, there are different forms of feedback. If a force stabilizes the difference between the actual and desired levels of stock then it’s known as a balancing feedback. Such a feedback is a chain of rules or physical laws that relate to the level of stock and have the ability to change it.  Take a thermostat which balances the temperature in a room. In this case the room temperature itself is the stock, heat from a radiator is the inflow and heat escaping through windows is the outflow. So, when the temperature falls, the thermostat notices the difference between the desired temperature and the real one within the room. Thus, it tells the heater to turn on.  But that’s just one form of feedback; another is reinforcing feedback, which perpetually generates more – or less – of what already exists. So, the more money you have in a savings account, the more interest you accrue, and the more interest you accrue, the more money you have in your account. The reinforcing mechanism can produce constant, even exponential, growth or destruction. These two feedbacks are crucial because one of the most common as well as important system structures consists of a stock with one balancing and one reinforcing feedback.  For instance, a positive birth rate serves as reinforcing feedback for a human population because it can produce exponential growth – the more people there are, the more babies there are, and those babies grow up to have children of their own. However, population also has a balancing feedback – death. So, as a population becomes unsustainably large, the balancing feedback kicks in as people die due to things like disease and insufficient resources.  Have you ever wondered why certain systems, like well-running machines or the world’s ecosystems, function so seamlessly? Well, resilience is a major determining factor in a system’s ability to adapt to changing conditions.  That’s because resilience is a system’s elasticity, or how well it recovers from a transition. The resilience of any given system is a product of its structure as well as its feedbacks, which work in different ways, directions and on varying time scales. Take the human body. It can protect itself from invading forces, tolerate a wide range of temperatures, adapt to changes in its food supply, reallocate blood and even repair bones.  But people often underestimate the importance of resilience, sacrificing it to goals like productivity or comfort to the point where the system collapses. For example, industry utilizes natural resources for profit but as a result, species die off, chemicals alter the soil and toxins concentrate, so environmental catastrophes become inevitable. However, resilience isn’t the only defense available to systems; some of them can also self-organize. That means they can learn, diversify, evolve and build on their own structure: a single, fertilized ovum has the ability to become a fully grown human.  So, as systems build new, increasingly complex structures, they naturally organize themselves based on a hierarchy. In fact, everything on earth is divided into subsystems that form larger subsystems, which produce larger ones yet. A cell in your liver is a subsystem of the organ itself, which is a subsystem of yourself, and you’re a subsystem of a family, which is a subsystem of a nation, and so on.  But why hierarchies? Because they reduce the level of information any given part of the system has to handle. For example, since liver cells know how to decompose toxins, lung cells don’t need to.  Systems that we know well can seem transparent, but we’ll end up misconstruing them if we focus too much on their outputs and not enough on their real behavior – or the way they each function over time. The problem is, since a system’s outputs are its most visible aspect, we often simplify systems into a series of events. It’s easy for us to only pay attention to games won and lost, or the percentage of the Amazon that has been deforested.  So, imagine you’re watching a football game in which both teams are evenly matched, but one team is playing exceptionally well. When they win the game, the result will be less surprising to you than to someone who only sees the final score or output.  But that’s not the only mistake we make. We also tend to anticipate linear relationships, despite the non-linear nature of the world. For instance, say you add ten pounds of fertilizer to a field, and it produces two bushels of wheat. You might then expect that adding 20 pounds would produce four bushels.  However, the real world doesn’t usually work that way. If you do add 20 pounds of fertilizer your yield might remain fixed because the excess nutrients damage the soil, reducing its fertility.  And finally, humans often forget that systems are very rarely separated from one another. That’s because our minds are only capable of processing so much. So, to simplify matters, we mentally isolate each system.  However, it’s easy to forget that those boundaries are artificial and we can become so accustomed to them that they feel natural. The result is a tendency to think in terms that are too broad or too narrow.  For example, if you’re brainstorming ways to reduce CO2 emissions, producing a detailed model of the planet’s climate will overly complicate the process, but focusing solely on the auto industry would prove equally fruitless. So, all systems share common features, but some of them can produce extremely unnatural and even problematic behavior. This can happen when the individual subsystems each have a different goal, and it’s called policy resistance. Here’s how it works. If one actor within a system or any of its subsystems gets the upper hand and uses it to shift the system’s direction, all the others will have to work twice as hard to pull it back in line. The result is a system that looks stuck, reproducing the same problems over and over again.  For instance, drug traffickers and addicts both want drug supplies to be high, but law-enforcement wants the opposite. So, when the cops prevent drugs from entering a country, prices on the street rise. As a result, addicts commit more crime to pay the higher prices and suppliers invest in planes and boats that can evade the authorities.  To correct such a system, it’s actually necessary to let go and turn the energy and resources available toward uniting the actors in the various subsystems. This way they can find a situation that works for everyone. But there can be other problems in a system. For instance, when it uses a resource that’s commonly owned and unsustainable. The result is inevitably collapse.  If land is used by several shepherds who keep adding animals to their herds, the pasture will eventually degrade as the grass lacks the time necessary to regrow, the roots lose their grip on the soil and rain washes it away.  Why does this happen? Because the feedback between the resources and the resource users is either nonexistent or highly delayed. To avoid collapse it’s necessary to educate users so they understand how their actions affect the resource and how they can restore it by regulating its use.  You’re probably thinking it would be great to have a way to make systems produce more of the good and less of the bad. Well, you’re in luck. That’s because by changing buffers, system design and delays, we can produce more effective systems.  How? Well, system buffers – like time, inventory and storage space – must be of optimal size to properly function. So, increasing the capacity of a buffer can stabilize a system. However, increasing it too much will make for an inflexible system. For example, businesses buy minimal inventory because allowing for the occasional product shortage is cheaper than investing in costly storage of goods that might not be sold.  System design is another important factor. That’s because a properly designed system allows for maximum efficiency, is less prone to fluctuation and has a better understanding of its own limitations and bottlenecks. For instance, in the past, the only road between east and west Hungary ran through the capital city. The congestion it produced couldn’t be fixed by the mere addition of traffic lights and the system required a total redesign.  Finally, delays – the time it takes a system or its actors to notice and respond to change – represent another point of leverage. Every system has them but when a system’s delays become long term it struggles to respond to short-term changes. As a result, delays should be proportional to a system’s rate of change.  In the case of global economics, the world is always pushing for more rapid economic growth, but the physical reality of elements like factories, technologies, prices and ideas don’t change at the same rate. In other words, there’s a delay. So, slowing down growth and, therefore, giving technology and prices time to catch up would make for a more efficient system.  So, changing the physical elements of a system can improve it, but there are other ways to fix problems. One is to focus on the flow of information, the rules of the system and its self-organization.  Systems often lack sufficient information flows. As a result, adding them can make significant improvements. For instance, installing electrical meters in hallways instead of basements reduced energy consumption by one-third in some Dutch suburbs simply because residents had access to information about their use and could adjust how much power they used accordingly.  But, if the people who benefit from the system also have the ability to set rules and exercise control over it, the system will not function well. If the world trade system is ruled by corporations, run by corporations and primarily benefits corporations, it will inevitably collapse.  Furthermore, when systems self-organize they can evolve and learn on their own – a fascinating characteristic, but one that often frightens humans as it means losing control. The result is the imposition of manmade limits on systems. However, this can often produce greater issues, so letting a system self-organize is a better move.  Systems also run into trouble when they hold incorrect goals or paradigms. If a system is based on the wrong goal and that goal is changed, the entire system will adapt. For instance, certain countries have found that a centralized system of economic planning doesn’t work for them. When their goals shifted, every subsystem in the economy adjusted to the new model.  And paradigms? Well, these are the deepest held beliefs on which a system is built – like, “growth is good” or “one can own land.” So, if a system’s paradigms are incorrect, they’ve got be changed. Ecologists have begun to shift the paradigms of environmental protection. The results have been changes in a variety of systems as industries, peoples, cities and entire countries start to adapt the way they manage waste.  At this point you probably understand that systems can’t be controlled and are only comprehensible in the most general sense. The good news: there are some simple steps that will help you better navigate the world of systems and increase their efficiency. First, it’s helpful to observe how a system behaves by learning its history and collecting information. The world is loaded with misconceptions, and the more data we have, the better judgments we can make. For example, while you might think prices are going up, they could just as well be going down.  Once you’ve collected data, you should write down how the system in question works, noting its structural arrangements and functions. This will double check that your models are complete, add up and are consistent.  The next step is to distribute the information in the system. Generally speaking, for a system to properly function its information needs to be distributed. So, the more timely, accurate and complete the information, the better the system will run.  While conducting this process you should pay attention to what’s important, both in terms of measurable and immeasurable factors. That’s because humans tend to place more value on numbers and quantity and less on quality as the former is easier to measure and relate to. But things like justice, democracy, security and freedom are essential too, even though they can’t be quantitatively assessed.  And it’s also key to notice how a system produces its own behavior. To do so just keep these questions in mind: Which external and internal influences produce certain behaviors? Are these factors controllable? Once you answer these questions you’ll be able to see where responsibility lies in the system as well as how actions are produced and what consequences they have. For example, if you’re upset about a delayed flight and ask yourself these questions you’ll be much less likely to take out your frustration on an innocent stewardess. The key message in this book: Everything we see, do and experience in this world is made of systems. While we cannot fully understand them, predict their behavior or exercise control over them, the least we can do is study the behavior and patterns they exhibit. Doing so will enable us to help them function better and identify when a broken system is in need of repair.  Actionable advice: Always expect a positive outcome, not a negative one.  It’s easy to see the world as worse off than it actually is and to assume that bad things will happen. For instance, if a salesman’s numbers dropped once, he’ll be much more likely to assume that they will again in the future and won’t be surprised if they do. The long-term effect is a lack of motivation to improve things, or drift to low performance. So, don’t let your expectations of greatness drop, instead keep your eyes fixed on the prize.

Even Barack Obama gave charity: water a shout-out at one point, calling Scott Harrison’s transformation from party promoter to humanitarian “the kind of promoting we need more of.” Indeed, much has been written about Harrison’s unlikely transition from the posh nightclubs of New York City to isolated villages in Africa. But now it’s time to hear the story in Harrison’s own words, to find out how it all started and how his ambitious idea transformed into what Harrison has called “a global movement of compassion.” In these blinks, you’ll find which book helped reconnect Harrison with his faith; the heartbreak behind the biggest donor campaign; and the tragic suicide that reaffirmed Harrison’s commitment to his cause. Scott Harrison was born in New Jersey in 1975, and as far back as he can remember, he’s had a restless drive to get things done. This energetic nature may even have saved his life early on when his childhood home had a carbon monoxide leak that nearly killed his mom. Since he was always outside playing, and his father was at work, it was only his mom who suffered the effects of the scentless, airborne toxin – though it would take a year of recurring symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea and passing out, before the source of his mom’s troubles were identified. Yet, once the leak from the home’s heating system was found, Scott’s childhood only got more unusual. The carbon monoxide leak caused the Harrisons to move, but no matter where they went, his mom would feel sick from the slightest scents. Strong smells like onions, hairspray and pipe smoke weren’t the only offenders – even someone’s makeup could be too much. Sometimes the family would drive out in the middle of the night to find a spot in the countryside where she could get some relief. One night, the smell of car exhaust from a nearby highway was too much, so they ended up sleeping on hay in a barn. As a young boy, unusual excursions like this were actually quite fun for Scott, like camping out. But as he became a teenager, his mother’s illnesses became more of a burden for a kid who just wanted a normal adolescence. Scott’s mom also became sensitive to any electromagnetic radiation in the air, so there was no TV or radio in the house, on top of there being no gas oven. Plus, a local doctor also diagnosed her as allergic to most foods. Then there was the issue of his schooling. Not long after Scott was born, the Harrisons became a very religious family, so Scott was enrolled in a small Christian school with five classrooms that held around nine students each. It was called the New Life Christian School, and Scott hated it so much he told his parents, in no uncertain terms, that he was going to go to public school instead. So, in 1991, 16-year-old Scott suddenly found himself the new kid at a much bigger high school. Fortunately for him, he had one skill that helped him make friends: he knew how to play piano. Since he was around six years old, Scott had been playing the piano, starting with an old pump organ belonging to his grandparents. Looking to make friends at his new school, Scott responded to a flyer from a band looking for a keyboard player, and soon enough he was a member of Sunday River. It being the early 1990s, Sunday River sounded like a cross between Pearl Jam and Counting Crows, yet they were good enough to start getting gigs and even recorded a demo tape. Scott immediately became quite active in pushing the group forward, calling up clubs to book gigs and promoting the band – so much so, that he skipped a lot of classes in his senior year and barely graduated. Naturally, Scott’s parents wanted him to go to college. Ideally, they wanted him to go to a nice Christian school like Wheaton College, but Scott was in his rebellious teenage years and pushed against this. As he saw it, what was the point of college when his band was on the verge of superstardom? Soon after graduation, Scott moved to New York City and found work at a music shop selling keyboards. One evening, he even got to help Stevie Wonder buy $50,000 worth of gear. Around this time, in 1995, the band’s manager introduced Scott to one of New York City’s biggest nightclubs: Club USA in Times Square. Even though Scott had been a clean and sober Christian boy growing up, he somehow felt right at home with the bright lights, loud music and crowded dance floor. But it wasn’t long before the band broke up, went their separate ways and left Scott to figure out what to do next. Fortunately, he was introduced to Patrick Allen, who produced a regular music showcase for up-and-coming talent. Eager to get into the business any way he could, Scott told Allen he was willing to work for free in exchange for the experience. Eventually, Scott learned how to manage guest lists and keep an event moving along, and Allen began paying Scott some of the night’s earnings. One recurring event was a blues music open-mic night at a club called Nell’s, and since Allen got another job with a musical that was going on tour, he left Scott in charge of producing “Voices at Nell’s.” While working at Nell’s, Scott became friends with the club’s manager Tex Axile, a colorful Scottish character with an endearingly foul mouth. Aside from learning many new swear words, Tex also taught Scott the ins and outs of nightclub management. Then, one day, Tex told Scott about a new 10,000-square-foot dinner club called Lotus that was opening up in Manhattan’s trendy Meatpacking District and looking for promoters. Scott didn’t have much of a track record, but he clearly had energy and ambition, so the management at Lotus took a chance and, with low expectations, he was given the slowest night of the week to promote: Mondays. With his foot in the door, Scott quickly proved himself one of the city’s best nightclub promoters. The normal routine was to start out around 10 pm by treating a group of clients to a meal at whatever restaurant was big at the time. Generally, restaurants will wine and dine a promoter’s client free of charge since their presence will attract other clients who want to be seen as fashionable. Then, around midnight, the party would move to Lotus, where they’d be ushered through the velvet rope and into a private booth where they’d sit next to models with exotic names and order $600-dollar bottles of champagne that would otherwise sell for $60. Often, when the nightclub closed, the party would move to an after-hours place where more booze – as well as more illicit substances – would be had. By 2003, however, Scott was growing very tired of the routine. By this point, he and a former doorman at Lotus named Brantly Martin had started their own business, Brantly&Scott Inc., and they were running an average of three events every week while mixing business with pleasure on trips to Milan and other fashionably chic cities. Many of the long nights were fueled by cocaine and alcohol, with mornings spent under a gray cloud of shame. What’s more, Scott started to get strange feelings of numbness in his arms and legs. Then, after a New Year’s Eve party in Uruguay, he began reading a book his dad had given him called The Pursuit of God, by A. W. Tozer, which mentioned that numbness is a symptom of spiritual defectiveness.  Suddenly, it became clear that his lifestyle would never lead to satisfaction but simply the pursuit of more, more, more. Something had to change. The next logical step in the career of a promoter like Scott would have been to own his own club, but Scott was moving in another direction, away from the New York City nightlife altogether. He was listening to sermons from the businessman-turned-Bible teacher, Chuck Missler, on his iPod, and trying to cut down on the smoking and drinking – which isn’t easy to do when Budweiser and Bacardi are each paying you $2,000 a month to be seen drinking their products. But just as Scott was beginning to reconnect to his faith, there came an event that would really change his life once and for all. It started when Scott complained about a bouncer at a nightclub who was aggressively trying to shake his business partner down for a tip. The complaint ended up getting the bouncer fired, and soon afterward, Scott got a call from a friend warning him not to go home. The bouncer had a gun and was waiting for him to show up. Scott talked to the armed and angry man over the phone and offered to help him get another job, which seemed to calm him down, but Scott was still deeply shaken. He decided to hop in a car and get away from the city for a while, driving through Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, all the while listening to an audio recording of the Bible and feeling that sense of numbness ease away. One thing that suddenly struck a chord with Scott was the idea of tithing, something his parents had always done, which is to donate a percentage of your time or income to helping others. This sounded like exactly the kind of meaningful thing he needed to start doing. So he immediately filled out volunteer applications to a number of charities, including UNICEF, Oxfam and the World Food Program. But the only response Scott received was from the Mercy Ships program. This service involved a big ocean liner that had been converted into a floating hospital that would dock at places in Africa and offer aid and medical service to the surrounding area. They were looking for someone to help in the communications department, taking pictures and promoting their work. Since he’d spent the past few years getting used to life in the VIP section, the people in charge weren’t sure if Scott was really up for the challenge of months aboard an old boat, but in fact, it was exactly what he needed. In October 2004, the Mercy Ships’s 522-foot passenger liner left the Canary Islands for Cotonou, a port in Benin, Africa. Scott had sold off nearly everything in his New York City apartment, boarding the ship with little else besides a vintage Louis Vuitton bag stuffed with clothes and some packs of Nicorette. Scott was among over 300 workers who kept the boat and the onboard hospital running smoothly. On the way to their destination, Scott learned some eye-opening details about Benin’s eight million residents, such as their average life expectancy of 51 years and the fact that they only had four doctors for every 100,000 people. Comparatively, the United States has seven doctors for every 325 people and an average life expectancy of 79 years. Scott still had little idea of what to expect, but he was enthusiastic and eager to prove his worth. He was tasked with taking before-and-after pictures of patients as well as staff at work and writing up stories to go along with these pictures, which could then be used for recruitment, education, fundraising and marketing. Right from the get-go, Scott was all-in. When he saw that the line for patient screening in Cotonou was so long it wrapped around the auditorium where the screenings were taking place, he talked his way onto the roof of a nearby hotel where he could get the whole scene in one shot. Indeed, people had come from miles around, some walking for days and spending their last cent to get to Cotonou. One of Mercy Ships’ specialties was maxillofacial surgeries, which included the removal of tumors from the face and neck. One of the first patients Scott met was a 14-year-old boy, Alfred, with a tumor that had started in his mouth and, over four years, grown to the size of a volleyball, making it difficult for him to breathe and eat. Scott had seen nothing like it, and fortunately, Alfred’s tumor was benign and could be removed, but others weren’t so lucky. A young boy named Serafin had a malignant tumor, and when Scott heard that he would likely soon die because of it, he broke down in tears. He learned to focus on those, like Alfred, that they could help and understand that not every ailment is treatable. Soon, Scott was putting words to his pictures and sharing the stories of his Mercy Ships experiences in a way that would eventually lead to a new chapter in his life. Scott not only started a blog to share his Mercy Ships experiences, but he also used the prized mailing list of 15,000 people he’d formed during his time as a promoter to blast his posts out to his former clients. Some people unsubscribed immediately, unhappy about unexpectedly seeing a giant oozing tumor in their inbox, but by the end of Scott’s first voyage, his readers had actually increased. Scott had witnessed people blinded by cataracts regain their sight, as well as kids who’d lost their lips, noses or cheeks due to dirty drinking water that contained the deadly noma virus. This is a terrible flesh-eating disease that can be easily prevented by better sanitation. He prayed for all of them and was forced to reconcile with many of the things he’d taken for granted during his life, like access to clean shelter, medical care and safe drinking water. So, when he got back home in June 2005, Scott was determined to do something, and he found that he could actually put his experience and skills as a promoter to work for a good cause. Armed with his valuable mailing list, containing people with plenty of disposable income, he put on an exhibition simply entitled “mercy.” featuring a meticulously arranged display of photos and videos from Africa, all in a beautiful Soho gallery space. Scott hustled like never before, promoting the gala night like it was the event of the year. But what he couldn’t account for was Hurricane Katrina happening on the opening day. It suddenly became awkward and difficult to ask donors to help people overseas when people in New Orleans needed assistance. Yet, he still managed to earn Mercy Ships $96,000. It proved to Scott that he really could put his skills and talents to use in a meaningful way. He understood how he would focus those skills during his second tour with Mercy Ships. This time, in late 2005, the ship was stationed at Liberia, a nation devastated by years of civil war. At one point during his time there, he spoke with some doctors working at a hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, who told Scott that one of the best ways to help was to provide clean water, since half of the people treated at the hospital were there because of waterborne diseases, such as cholera, polio, dysentery and noma. In spring 2006, Scott met a woman known as Mama Vic who ran an orphanage about an hour outside of Monrovia, Liberia. Sometimes she looked after 150 kids, and the closest source of water was a mile and a half away, and the children hated fetching the water as they were often bullied by the local kids for being orphans. Moved by her amazing resilience in helping so many children amid terrible conditions and often violent times in Liberia, Scott called his aunt and uncle to raise the $2,500 needed to drill a well for the orphanage. Scott was keenly aware that the well provided more than just clean water. Since the job of digging the well also provided work and wages for people in the village, it improved people’s relationship toward the orphanage. In general, it improved lives in more ways than one. After witnessing the water rise up into the air when the well was tapped, it was all Scott could think about. And when he returned to the United States in mid-2006, he knew he wanted to fund more wells, using his talent of getting people to open up their wallets. This is how charity: water was born on September 8, 2006. It all started in the apartment of his former business partner, Brantly, who was still living the intoxicating late-night lifestyle. In fact, one of charity: water’s early donations came from Brantly’s weed-dealing friend. Thanks to Scott’s strengths in hosting events and creating a trustworthy and appealing brand, charity: water got off to a great start. Early events were supported by the likes of actors Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo, and the organization’s $20 bottles of water – which made donating as simple as buying a bottle of water – were a big hit at posh events throughout the city. One of the early events was also attended by a young woman named Viktoria Alexeeva, who reached out to say that she wanted to not only support charity: water, but also to volunteer her services as a graphic designer, with experience on campaigns for Nike and American Express. Scott wasn’t going to say no to free professional help, and Viktoria was soon handling video editing and web design as well. What’s more, Scott and Viktoria eventually became more than colleagues; in 2009, they married. When Scott started charity: water, he didn’t want to just create another place for someone to make a donation, feel good for a moment and then forget about it. Instead, he wanted to create a revolutionary charity with “radical transparency” that ensured every penny of a donation was spent getting people clean water and keeping donors constantly up-to-date on how their money was being put to use. To engage donors in exciting new ways, Scott came up with the idea for birthday campaigns. This allowed people to set up a campaign page on the charity: water website where they could direct friends and family to make a donation rather than buy presents. Every September, the month both Scott and charity: water were born, a campaign drive is held to meet a certain goal, and it’s often one of the year’s biggest fundraising events. In its first year, $159,000 was raised in just four weeks. But in 2011, one birthday campaign became a very tragic, humbling and bittersweet event. Rachel Beckwith first heard about charity: water when she was eight years old. Scott then joined Lady Gaga as one of her two favorite people in the world. Rachel always liked helping people in need, so she decided she wanted to start her own campaign for her ninth birthday and managed to raise $220. It was a little short of her $300 goal, but she was happy to try again next year. Tragically, however, Rachel’s life was cut short when the car she was in with her mother, Samantha, was part of a 15-car pile-up involving a semi-truck and a jackknifed logging trailer. But her story didn’t end there. Rachel’s page was reopened, and the news of her generous spirit spread around the world. A week later, her $220 became $750,000, surpassing all previous birthday campaigns. And when it finally closed, Rachel had collected an astounding $1,265,823. It was enough to fund 142 water projects and bring clean water to 37,770 people. When Scott took Rachel’s mom to one of the villages in Ethiopia, she got to see just how big of a difference her daughter had made. Rachel’s story was both heartbreaking and inspiring, and, as with all donor money, Scott felt a great responsibility to use each cent she raised as best he could. For this reason, each partnership charity: water makes with the businesses drilling the wells in Africa is put through a rigorous vetting process, and detailed reports are given to every donor, whether they give $1 or $1,000 so that they can see what’s happening with the project they helped fund. So, it was frustrating, to say the least, when Scott learned that a corporate donor was so displeased with charity: water’s efforts that they were filing a lawsuit. At first, Scott was concerned about the bad press this might generate, but then he recognized it as an opportunity. Charity: water made every decision according to how they could best spend donors’ money. Of course, they couldn’t help it if violence broke out in the region where a project had been scheduled, or if workers were injured in an accident. Nevertheless, one donor was so upset that a well in Kenya was delayed and certain resources were allocated to help schools instead of hospitals, that they felt the need to take legal action. In response, Scott wrote an open letter to his board members and the public, reaffirming his dedication to “radical transparency” and the charity’s vetting process. Ultimately, there was no bad press or lost funds. In response, Scott received support from other CEOs that kept his spirits up until the case was finally resolved by sending the donor’s money to a different charity. In 2010, there was another bad situation that proved to have a silver lining. That year, charity: water was funding a well in Moale in the jungle of the Central African Republic (CAR). Jim Hocking, founder of the Water for Good organization, was coordinating the drilling. This was Jim’s third time trying to create a well in Moale to help the Bayaka tribe, but sadly the third time was not the charm as the well’s muddy walls continually collapsed. Scott had promised a video of the well being opened, which he obviously couldn’t deliver. But he didn’t  want to avoid the truth, either. They did put out a video, as promised, explaining why they couldn’t bring the Bayaka clean water this time around. And once again, this honesty didn’t lead to angry donors; it generated many compliments from people saying they trusted charity: water even more than before. In 2012, Scott was sitting in a hotel bar in Ethiopia when the owner approached him to say thanks for the work he’d done in the area. The owner explained that he was from a village where it was very difficult to access water. It was such an ordeal, that when one woman fell and broke her pot of water, she was so distraught that she hanged herself from a tree just outside the village. The story haunted Scott, and when he got back home, he wanted to find out more. With some help, he traced the story back to an isolated Ethiopian village called Meda. So, in November 2013, Scott wanted to learn more and undertook the difficult nine-hour hike to Meda. The day after his arrival, Scott was introduced to the mother of Letikiros Hailu, the girl who’d hanged herself, and learned that she was just 13 years old when she died. She’d recently been married to a kind young man who was only a few years older than her. But instead of quitting school like other girls do upon marriage, she wanted to continue her education. This wasn’t easy when she was responsible for fetching the water. It could take up to ten hours to bring back just a few gallons. So she tried to go to school three days a week while fetching water on the other days, but it meant she was falling behind the other students. Scott walked the treacherous path to the stream, which wound along a steep cliff, with a 100-foot drop that had taken several lives. The stream itself was little more than a trickle, enough to slowly fill three pots in one hour. So it was around dusk when Letikiros would have returned to the village with the heavy clay pot strapped to her back. It may have been too dark, or perhaps she was weak from heat and hunger, but she tripped and fell, breaking the pot and losing the water for which her mother was waiting. No one knows exactly why, but it was likely shame that drove Letikiros to hang herself rather than return home empty-handed. Letikiros isn’t the only 13-year-old girl in this situation, and it’s precisely why Scott continues to push for charity: water to continue growing and bringing more water to more people. As the story of Letikiros shows, clean water not only prevents disease, it also empowers people, especially young women, by allowing them to get an education and avoid having to choose between a clean body and clean clothes. Scott’s commitment to keeping charity: water growing led him to consider stepping down as CEO in 2015. That year was the first time they didn’t bring in more donations than the year before. And the truth is, Scott knows he isn’t the best CEO. To begin with, he doesn’t enjoy running meetings and holding employees accountable. However, when he floated the idea of stepping down, it didn’t go over well, with one employee immediately telling him, “I didn’t join to work for another CEO; I joined because I want to work for you.” Other voices were soon helping Scott see things in the right perspective. Scott was hung up on the number of people connected to clean water dipping from one million to 800,000 between 2014 and 2015. But thanks to his support team, he was able to shift his focus away from the 200,000 he didn’t help to the 800,000 people whose lives were changed by charity: water. And why not focus on the many areas where improvements were made in 2015, like innovation and sustainability? In 2015, charity: water designed and built their very own state-of-the-art sensors to tell them immediately when a well wasn’t working. They also established teams of trained repair personnel throughout Africa, equipped with GPS-assisted motorbikes, who can quickly service a well and get it operational again. With these advances, they had 90 percent of the wells in Ethiopia working, far surpassing the 60 percent functionality that was once the status quo. In 2016, during charity: water’s tenth year, the company also solved one of its own sustainability problems with “The Spring.” It’s always been a challenge to take care of overhead costs, such as employee health coverage, when 100 percent of donations go toward projects. But The Spring goes a long way to solving this problem by offering donors a monthly payment plan that directly funds the business side of things. And for helping keep the lights on at charity: water, members of The Spring get exclusive updates, videos and other inspirational features. Fortunately, The Spring was an immediate success, which has allowed Scott to breathe more easily and plan for tomorrow. The key message in these blinks: It’s been an unusual journey for Scott Harrison, from the nightclubs of New York City to the isolated villages of Ethiopia. In sharing his unique story, Harrison hopes to inspire people around the world to give to those who can’t take clean water for granted. In the years since he began his charity: water organization, Harrison has seen amazing acts of compassion and generosity – so many, that he believes we really can solve the world’s water crisis if we all work together.       Got feedback?

What to read next: The Price of Thirst, by Karen Piper As Scott Harrison discovered, bringing people clean water has its challenges. But in some cases, it’s less a matter of overcoming nature’s obstacles in order to dig a well and more of overcoming the politics and bureaucracy behind an area’s water system. In many places around the world, such as Chile, public water is a privatized business, with millions of dollars up for grabs. In The Price of Thirst (2014), author Karen Piper digs deep into this complex subject to show how the cost of business is keeping clean water from getting to people in need. So, if you want to look at another reason why clean water can be hard to come by, we recommend the blinks to The Price of Thirst.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

This commercial savvy has often been presented in a negative light; however, in spite of these goyish aspersions, the ability to produce wealth that’s often ascribed to Jewish people is now generally recognized as a positive and enviable attribute. But why have Jews become successful in business and how can it serve as inspiration for others? Jewish prosperity in business is rooted in the books and oral history that make up the Jewish religious canon. In combination with Jewish traditions, the Torah, Talmud and other sources have inspired and guided Jews for millennia. These blinks reveal how you – or anyone who wants to succeed in business – can draw inspiration from these sources as well. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a minyan is a good way to make business connections; that a good leader must first be able to follow; and what the Star of David teaches us about change. If you’re familiar with Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, you know that the Jewish character of Shylock is portrayed as a greedy and vengeful loan shark who’s only interested in money. Unfortunately, this derogatory portrayal of the Jewish businessman has persisted. In addition to this negative image, there are many false theories about why Jews have tended to have business success. One absurd theory suggests that Jews evolved in such a way that moneymaking is simply part of their DNA. Jews have survived countless periods of persecution, so it’s been suggested that only wealthy Jews survived these ordeals since they could buy their way out. Therefore, the future generations of Jews were born with a so-called “money gene.” Another nasty theory is that all Jews are cheaters. However, this enduring myth is refuted by the Torah, the holy book that defines Jewish law. It specifically calls for people to maintain an honest reputation when doing business. Any instances of cheating would be a direct offense against God. Then there’s the conspiracy theory that Jews are part of some secret society. While it’s true that community is an important part of Jewish life, Jews also tend to be very argumentative, so it’s ridiculous to think they could keep some secret organization together and under wraps. People also often think of Jews as possessing superior intelligence. But intelligence generally doesn’t increase monetary gain since people with higher IQs tend to become academics and scientists, not business leaders. When Jewish people do become successful, it’s because they’ve received a good education at home and in the synagogue. A Jewish home is often filled with books, and the centrality of education in Jewish life is why Jews throughout history have had high literacy rates. This is also why, even though Jews only comprise 0.2 percent of the world’s population, there is a disproportionately large number of books published every year concerning Jewish themes. In addition to the Torah’s teachings, there are also oral traditions that continue to be passed down. A common lesson is to sacrifice present pleasures for future benefits – a reminder that putting in hard work today may well lead to a successful business tomorrow. It’s not uncommon for corporations and businesses to be demonized by politicians and the media. And this can turn people’s attention away from the job creation and the charitable work that comes from the private sector. On a more personal level, a healthy business venture can also make people feel better about themselves. It’s not unlike someone being part of a clinical trial and being given a placebo: the patient often ends up feeling better just by being part of the program. The same can happen when someone is part of a noble business pursuit. Due to the teachings of the Torah, Jews will apply this kind of morality to doing business and earning money. Jewish wisdom teaches us that success only comes if the business has the approval of our friends; it’s this approval that creates the passion and drive behind the endeavor. We’re also urged to be virtuous and ethical. When we see ourselves as morally upright, running our business in an honest and ethical fashion, we’re less likely to enter illegal or immoral territory. Of course, if someone gets away with cheating, they’ll probably be tempted to cheat again. However, this can be prevented by atonement. Atonement – being “at one” with God – is an important part of Judaism. By atoning, one can “reset” after committing a bad deed. But to reset one has first to learn from what one did wrong and diminish the temptation to repeat the behavior. Here’s a little-known fact: Jews joined the banking profession in an effort to perform a noble service and help others. Jewish tradition views lending money, as opposed to giving money away, as a charitable act. By lending, others can start their own business and retain their independence and dignity in the process. This goes against another misconception: that Jews became bankers to escape oppression. Christians and Muslims tend to subscribe to a literal interpretation of the Bible that prohibits charging interest. But the oral traditions that were passed down – the Jewish laws that were not written in the Torah – taught Jews that there were moral circumstances that permit charging interest. Now that you know some of the noble reasons for getting into business, let’s take a look at how tradition can lead to successful business relationships. In a traditional Jewish workplace, coworkers are not unlike friends and family. But for these kinds of relationships to develop, they have to be genuine. People can sense false intentions, so it won’t work if a friendly environment is forced. You might think of friends and family as being separate from business, but they can actually be a good source of inspiration. For Richard Simon, his personal relationships lead to him becoming a pillar of the publishing world. As a child, Simon saw how much his grandmother and her friend loved doing the Sunday crossword puzzle together. But they would always finish it by Tuesday, which left them with four puzzleless days. Sensing a market for a book full of puzzles, Simon took the idea to his friend Lincoln Schuster, and, before, long the publishing giant Simon and Schuster was born. The communal nature of traditional Jewish life also provides a helpful network of connections. Traditional Jewish prayer requires a quorum of ten men called a minyan; every synagogue in every city has one. So whenever a Jewish businessman is traveling, he can join a minyan and find a number of opportunities to form new relationships. And since this kind of network is always growing and evolving, there are always new possibilities. There are also teachings that can help form successful new relationships by allowing people to better understand themselves and how others perceive them. Once we clearly understand how others see us, we can change things about ourselves that might be hindering a successful relationship. These lessons about self-change are taught by Mussar, a body of ancient Jewish literature. In this context, “change” doesn’t simply mean changing how you appear; it also means changing who you really are. And with this understanding, relationships can take on a deeper, even spiritual, meaning. Are you a perfectionist? Do you end up working longer and harder than others because you’re never satisfied until things are absolutely flawless? Well, trying to be perfect is a fool’s errand because, in fact, nothing is perfect – especially when it comes to business. There is a Jewish belief called “ethical capitalism,” which reminds us that people are taught the ways of business by others and that this, in turn, can lead to corruption. It also reminds us that it’s wrong to blame capitalism for the mistakes of a few capitalists. It helps to look at business as an inanimate object. You can’t blame an object for causing problems; you can only blame the people who misuse it. Bernie Madoff is a perfect example. His Ponzi scheme cheated people out of millions of dollars by means of fraud and false trust. So we must hold Madoff accountable, rather than blaming capitalism. Being moral in your business practices is a challenge since most actions can have both good and bad effects. When we look at the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and the railroad tycoon George Pullman, we see two people who improved society at a great cost to others. Carnegie is considered to be one of the biggest robber barons of the nineteenth century. And though Pullman pioneered US railway expansion, he exploited his workers by charging them higher rates for housing and food. Some workers for the Pullman Company owed more than they ever earned. But business, though far from perfect, doesn’t have to be evil, and there are Jewish traditions that show how one can work morally within the business system. They say business is driven by greed. But Jews are taught that you must provide for yourself before you can help others. By turning people into customers, business is considered dehumanizing. But Jewish tradition offers a different perspective: business emulates God’s creativity by being a source of growth and inventiveness. Business is also sometimes blamed for creating inequality. However, without business, there would be no wealth to sustain the economy. And it’s the government – not business – that’s responsible for just redistribution of this wealth. What comes to mind when you think of a great leader? There have been many great leaders over the years, and Jewish tradition shows us that there are certain characteristics that they all share. One of these characteristics is the ability to follow. Leaders often are, or were, followers. Even Moses, one of history’s greatest leaders, had a mentor: God. Leaders also have a vision and a goal, and they are persuasive in telling people how they’ll achieve it. God’s vision was the world we see before us, and his goal was the Sabbath. That’s why Jews celebrate the Sabbath every Friday night. And leaders aren’t afraid of necessary confrontation. The necessity of confrontation is driven home by the tale of Joseph. Joseph’s brothers, envious of the favor shown him by their father, plotted to kill Joseph. One of these brothers, Judah, instead of confronting his brothers, compromised and suggested they sell Joseph into slavery. This cost Judah his role as leader. If he had stood up to his brothers, it’s likely they would have listened to him and never attempted to kill or enslave Joseph. Leaders also use the power of faith. The power of faith can come in different forms. The most obvious is perhaps daily prayer. Less obvious is the ability to have faith in oneself and to instill that personal faith in others so that goals are achieved. And leaders carry themselves with a respectful presence. There’s a reason the Talmud, an ancient collection of rabbinical doctrines, calls the lion the “King of Beasts.” It’s not the biggest or strongest animal, but it earns its respect through its regal posture and careful movements. Another thing to consider is that there is no single definition of a leader, and that they fill many roles: guiding people through change, being an inspiring role model or helping people develop, for example. More often than not, people don’t become leaders by learning these skills; the role is thrust upon them under extraordinary circumstances. Many believe that New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani would never have been considered a notable leader if it hadn’t been for the chaotic and tumultuous events of 9/11. But this event brought out the leader in Giuliani, and he did an able job of guiding the city out of crisis. Many people fear change. Yet, as we grow older, we’re always learning and changing, even if we’re not aware of it. Judaism teaches us to embrace the fact that all humans are unique and that they continue to change throughout their lives. Once we learn to accept this change, we can then learn to profit from it. The Star of David provides clues for us to follow. The star is comprised of two triangles. The three points of one triangle represent three fixed entities – God, humans and the physical world. The other triangle’s points represent openness to change. Change, though often initially painful, is beneficial in the long run. Some companies go out of business when faced with change. For example, many companies went under when steel replaced cast iron as a construction material in the nineteenth century. But for those that hung on, innovations were soon introduced that allowed them to switch over to the new material, get rid of expensive equipment and retrain or replace employees. In the end, the change brought profits that outweighed the initial loss. Judaism shows us that change is easier to accept when it arrives gradually, which is why events that honor a marriage or a death take place over several days. Moving forward is a matter of staying connected to the parts of your life that will never change and remaining open to the things that should or have to change. This applies to successful business, too. Stay rooted to the company’s core values and mission statement, but don’t close yourself off to other opportunities. Disney does this well. It maintains a commitment to wholesome family entertainment, but that doesn’t stop it from buying other companies like Miramax to produce more adult-oriented fare. But be sure that you’ve actually set your roots in the company, and not, for instance, in capital from investors. Here’s a cautionary tale: there was once a successful family of jewelers in Montreal, and, in the late 1990s, the sons moved the business to Los Angeles to take advantage of the dot-com boom. The economy soon tanked and the jewelry business started losing money. This prompted the sons to move the business back to Montreal, to their roots, and, sure enough, success returned when they did. People also fear the uncertainty of the future. However, you can minimize uncertainty by making accurate predictions – something that’s not really that hard to do. The Talmud is explicit about how the wise are different from the prophetic: While a prophet can look into the future, the wise can look at today’s events and see what consequences they’ll have tomorrow. You don’t have to be a genius to see what the future has in store. You can actually train yourself to figure it out, but, to do that well, you must keep your ego and ambitions out of the equation. Ego can obscure the obvious. For instance, the crucial difference between Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill, two of history’s most intelligent British politicians, is that Chamberlain’s ego prevented him from seeing Hitler for who he really was. Churchill’s sight, on the other hand, remained unclouded by ego and ambition. To make an accurate forecast, you don’t need to become an expert on every business trend in the world – just the ones that directly affect your business. So, if you work for a tech company, stay informed on regulations that might change how people use the internet. And if you’re in the auto industry, pay attention to trade regulations, which might change the price of materials. Foreseeing the future comes from careful interpretation of both the present and the past. Generally, a steady and stable economy will stay that way unless an outside force brings change. The price of gold, for example, usually remains steady when inflation and civil unrest are at a minimum. However, investors recently noticed that gold prices were remaining stable despite inflation, which is when they realized that Russia was selling off its reserves to counteract inflation and keep investors buying. When Russia stopped interfering, the price of gold went up as predicted. Other things to keep an eye on are patterns and trends. These can be especially helpful in industries like fashion, where trends can help predict what will sell next year. The old adage that \"time is money\" is certainly true. However, there’s more to the equation than that. In the Talmud’s story of Joseph, we also learn that we are money and that money is part of us; it’s impossible to separate the two. Everything we possess – time, dignity, persistence, creativity energy – can be quantified in terms of money. And once we accept this notion, we can move forward and have a healthier relationship with money. Money can also create a bond of trust. This happens every time someone receives a check after performing a service. Money serves as a symbol of reputation as well. For instance, Ford paid nine billion dollars to purchase Jaguar and Volvo not because the companies’ assets were worth that much. Ford was buying their reputations. One of the Jewish terms for money is “zuz,” which, in English, means “to move.” Therefore, money is something that naturally moves between people; when it doesn’t, economies can go into recession or fall apart completely. So money isn’t meant to be kept hidden away or stashed under a mattress. It’s far better to follow Jewish wisdom and use that money for charitable purposes, which can spark the creation of even more wealth. Jewish tradition holds that giving money to charity is more spiritually beneficial to the giver than to the receiver. There’s no rational explanation for this – it’s just the right thing to do. The United States even bases its tax laws on this principle, which is why donations to religious and charitable foundations are not taxed. In fact, one of the best ways to increase your income is to give your money away. No one likes doing business with someone who seems desperate to cling to every penny. It’s better to have a reputation as a giver since most people want to be involved with charitable causes. But remember: though charitableness can come with rewards, you should mainly give because it’s the moral thing to do. Here’s another apt adage: “Life is a journey, not a destination.” One should learn to regard business the same way. This means that we shouldn’t be counting the days to retirement. There’s no reason to stop earning money when we hit a certain age. To retire is to stop providing value to society. It’s also to limit your potential. So pretend you’re an Olympic athlete running the 400-meter dash. You don’t come to a full stop once you hit the finish line; you keep going, even though you’re slowing down. And don’t fixate on the end goal. Focusing on retirement can give you a distorted view of life that may cause you to slow down before you even get there. Instead, be one of the many people who’ve remained active and productive in their later years. At age 65, Harlan Sanders was virtually penniless. He was tired of trying to survive on a small monthly retirement check from the government. And so, for the next 15 years, he sold fried chicken and began the empire known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, now known as KFC. Many people are fooled by three lies that get told about retirement. The first is that work has no real value – that it’s just a means to an end. From this perspective, the only reason to work is to one day no longer have to. Jewish tradition teaches us otherwise. Work has value for the worker and humanity. It gives them dignity and transforms the world around them. Another lie is that we become weaker and less productive in old age. But unless you have an extremely physical job, you’re likely to become more productive as you get older. As you continue to grow your network of contacts, you’ll have more and more opportunities to generate wealth. The third lie is that people are meant to be consumers, not creators. But as we’ve seen in these blinks, spirituality and creating wealth can go hand in hand, and as we get older our connection to our spiritual selves only gets deeper. The key message in this book: We can create success and wealth in business by looking to the ancient teachings and wisdom of Judaism. These principles can be applied to many business situations in the modern world. Actionable advice: Be a numinous networker. It’s easy to think of networking as a way to make quick connections to improve your business. But try thinking about these connections in a deeper, more numinous way – in other words, as deeper, more spiritual relationships. Your business networks should be treated like long-lasting and fruitful relationships that benefit both you and the people you’re working with. Got feedback?

Many people living in San Francisco feel the company has betrayed its do-gooder philosophy. Why? With the tech boom in the Bay Area, many historic neighborhoods in San Francisco experienced skyrocketing rents as well-paid techies moved in and teachers and public servants – people who earned much less – were forced out. This growing crisis came to a head with the advent of “Google buses.” The tech giant used publicly funded bus stops to load employees on to private, air-conditioned buses to make the commute down the peninsula. Protests broke out, and in Oakland, locals even threw rocks at the buses. But the conflict wasn’t just about a private bus, it was about the gap between haves and have-nots, the unequal distribution of societal benefits. That’s what these blinks are about. The digital economy is creating growth for people who already have money, while the rest of us just gets poorer. These blinks offer a brief history of industrialization, showing how business has always been about keeping elites in status and power. In these blinks, you’ll learn why online commerce is unfair to small businesses; why reducing working hours actually makes people more productive and happier; and how one Massachusetts county makes its own money. There was once a time when a person had to either make or sell any product on the market. If you sat down at a restaurant, for example, you had to order your meal from a waiter. These days, you can go to McDonalds and order a burger from a self-service stand. What does that mean for employees? People all over are losing their jobs. A company’s relentless pursuit of growth is essentially taking jobs away from people. Computers are often scapegoated for the decline in jobs, but really, it’s our greed for growth that is to blame. Businesses are so eager to expand that they replace people with cheaper machines whenever possible. How did we get here? Why do we as a society rely on such a small number of rich companies for employment and economic prosperity? The answer to this question starts with the Middle Eastern bazaar system, an open market for exchanging goods and ideas. Europeans who took part in the Crusades brought this market idea back with them to Europe. The introduction of open markets led to rapid economic growth in Europe as well as the expansion of a merchant class, people with the ability to exchange products and services directly, without middlemen. A craftsman, for example, could go to a market and buy oats directly from a peasant for a price equal to its real value, since there was no longer the need to pay a commission to a grain dealer. As the merchant class grew wealthier, however, the aristocratic class started to lose both wealth and clout. So they developed monopolies, which led to the top-down economic system we still use today. They essentially killed the open market by granting certain companies exclusive rights in the industry in exchange for a share of their profits, curtailing trade in the bazaars. This eventually led to our modern system of markets, in which workers earn wages from market-controlling companies, rather than trading directly from one another. An open market gives each individual both the opportunity to sell any product or purchase any product. The digital marketplace should do the same, yet instead, it has just made big companies even bigger. In fact, online commerce ensures that only a few companies can effectively reach the largest pools of customers. Wired CEO Chris Anderson once predicted that online commerce would enable smaller companies to promote products and services more easily, yet in reality this has not been the case. Consider the online music industry. Today an even smaller percentage of hit songs than in previous eras make up the total amount of music sold. The bottom 94 percent of songs offered on iTunes, for example, have sold less than 100 copies each. The market for physical albums worked differently. When this was the main mode of music sales, 20 percent of all available albums made up 80 percent of all albums sold – so the bottom 80 percent of the market equalled 20 percent of all sales. Why did this change in the digital era? It changed because the factor of human selection was removed. Online platforms now use bots to drive purchases. When a track is placed on a recommendation list, it causes an uptick in sales. That bump is fed back into an automated system, generating recommendations for similar tracks. So once a song has been recommended, it enters a loop that keeps it in front of other users, stimulating even more sales. And which songs get to enter this lucrative recommendation loop? The same ones that companies pay online platforms specifically to push. Online platforms are the business tools of music companies! As consumers, we've become slaves to recommendation algorithms. There's an overwhelming amount of music available on the internet; one person could never sift through it all. So as a result, we rely on manipulated popularity lists and automated algorithms to find our music for us. In school, you were taught that “sharing is caring.” If you have an object or tool that someone else might find useful, sharing it with that person is the right thing to do. Today the internet is chock-full of crowd-sharing apps, or platforms that allow people to share goods or services online. Crowd-sharing apps are geared to increase efficiency in a user’s life, ensuring that needs are met easily. Airbnb, for instance, allows people around the world to “share” apartments, rooms or couches with travelers. But crowd-sharing apps aren't really about sharing but about selling. Crowd-sharing services can be problematic as they can eat away at established markets and businesses. People using such apps “share” assets, but those assets have a price. People who rent living space on Airbnb, for example, do so for a higher rate than it would cost to rent the same space outside the Airbnb system. Those people can then put the money they earn toward rent at an even cheaper apartment, spending or saving the rest of the cash for themselves. Airbnb rates are often still cheaper than renting a room at a hotel, and as a result, hotels are struggling to compete. Yet hotels have to maintain expensive business licenses, pay wages to professional staff and conform with safety regulations, so they'll never be able to offer prices as low as those offered on Airbnb. That's why so many people are losing jobs to crowd-sharing platforms, as such platforms effectively eliminate skills or talent from the business equation. Skills and talent just aren't that important in the digital era. An experienced taxi driver might know every street in a city, but a driver for Uber can perform just as well with a GPS system. And self-driving cars might soon eliminate the need for drivers completely! Let’s say you’re at the supermarket and want a bar of chocolate. Instead of paying for it with cash, however, you have to offer another item or service for it. Maybe you trade a cup of coffee for the chocolate bar, or offer to post a letter for someone. This is how trade worked in the Middle Ages. But the system wasn't efficient, as not every “buyer” had something a “seller” would want. To overcome this problem, currencies were invented. In essence, money was developed to make transactions easier. Both sides of a trade could even become more prosperous. Indeed, the circulation of money in the late Middle Ages led to an increase not only in production and sales but also in general living standards, giving rise to a merchant or “middle” class. Yet the ruling aristocratic class feared the growing influence in wealth and power of the merchant class. Aristocrats, given their position in society, facilitated trade. Yet as the power of the merchant class grew, aristocrats looked to financial advisors to find a way to maintain an economic advantage. The ruling class wanted to retain control over the growing middle class, so they had to find a way to control their money. Money soon became an end in itself, not a means to facilitate trade. Aristocrats decided to outlaw local currencies in exchange for uniform currencies that they could standardize and thus influence. If merchants needed money to buy goods, they now had to borrow it from the royal treasury and pay it back with interest. Centralized currencies rose in value, and the interest generated lined the pockets of the ruling aristocrats. In short, the rich got richer, while the rest of society did not. It's normal to work long hours, but while long days at the office may help a company grow, it takes a toll on a worker’s health and quality of life. We could make our lives more enjoyable as well as protect the planet by reducing work hours. The 40- hour work week is no longer necessary. Production methods are now so efficient that human workers aren't as important as they once were. Reducing the hours of a work day could also reduce a worker’s carbon footprint, as fewer people would commute to work in cars or trains that emit carbon dioxide. A shorter work day would also give people more time to focus on other things. According to Boston College sociologist Juliet Schor, people with extra time would actually contribute to the economy without expecting a monetary return. We could offer care for elderly people, teach or make art, for instance. People would also have more time to relax. You could walk or ride a bike to work, instead of driving or taking public transit. Doing so would allow people to be less stressed out when they get to the office! Even just changing the work day could have positive effects. The state of Utah explored changing working hours for its public employees. Instead of having people work eight hours a day, five days a week, they worked ten hours a day, four days a week – and had a three-day weekend. The employees as a result reported being happier, more productive and even said that family relationships improved. The state saved $4 million by eliminating unnecessary overtime hours, too! Corporations need to start working for employees, not just for growth. The increase in profits brought on by new technology could be used to improve people’s lives, as well as the bottom line. Officials of Berkshire County in Massachusetts have done something unusual. They've created a local currency, called Berkshares. The “exchange rate” is 100 Berkshares to $95. Local currencies such as Berkshares are great, as they foster money circulation in local communities and make money a means again rather than a goal in and of itself. Berkshire locals receive discounts when they pay for goods in Berkshares, so customers and merchants prefer to buy goods from nearby suppliers for cheaper prices. This transaction incentivizes producers to produce more. The local economy grows, and money stays in the community. When money is circulated within local communities like this, community welfare is improved. And when banks encourage the usage of local currencies, for example, they create a win-win situation. Imagine a local pizzeria is seeking a $200,000 bank loan to expand its business. Usually, if a bank accepts, the loan is provided with interest. This is a risk for the pizzeria, because if it can’t pay back the loan with interest, the business could suffer or close altogether. There are other options, though. Imagine instead if the bank offered the pizzeria a $100,000 loan, and required it to raise the rest within the community, selling coupons in a local currency. A $100 coupon might be worth $120 in pizza, for instance. This scheme could help the pizzeria raise the extra funds. In general, the bank’s risk in offering the loan is also decreased. Customers themselves help a business grow, making it even easier for the pizzeria to repay the original loan. The pizzeria can now expand without being burdened by huge interest payments, and is confident that the community is eager to support its growth. Customers, in turn, are rewarded by a 20 percent discount on pizza! The key message in this book: Money was once a tool for traders and merchants, but it quickly transformed into a form of power and control for the ruling classes. The introduction of open markets initially fostered growth, but as aristocrats were threatened by a rising middle class, the creation of centralized currencies and interest-based loans helped them increase their influence while holding the rest of society back. The digital revolution has done little to reverse this; yet if we explored the usage of local currencies, we could make money a means again, rather than just something we desire to accumulate for its own sake.

If you think Delaware is a strange place for a Ukrainian man smuggling guns into African civil wars to call home, you clearly underestimate the power and influence of tax havens. Tax havens are jurisdictions that use their own legislation to help individuals and companies alike to get around taxation and regulations in their home countries. These blinks explain tax havens in depth, including their secrecy tactics, and how tax havens are rife with tax evasion, money laundering and financial instability. After reading these blinks, you’ll know how Starbucks uses tax havens to hide their wealth; how a single building in Delaware can house more than 200,000 companies; and which country is the world’s largest tax haven – you’ll be surprised! As you probably know, tax havens have low tax rates – for some. You might’ve heard stories of corrupt dictators or mafia bosses keeping money in Switzerland or the Cayman Islands. What’s the purpose of this? It’s quite simple: secrecy. A secrecy jurisdiction enables people or entities to escape certain laws and regulations by relocating their funds to hidden places. Tax havens don’t cooperate with authorities from other countries. You can’t tax someone without knowing how much money they have. This is why your bank notifies the authorities when money is put into your account. Tax havens don’t provide this information to authorities, however. They only provide information if the authorities already know the specifics of your offshore banking, and even then there’s a process to go through. Even if a tax haven does share information with law enforcement authorities, they still provide services to protect their clients. Many tax havens have flee causes, for example. That means that if Interpol comes looking for your money, your assets will automatically be moved to another place, like an account in a different tax haven. Ultimately, tax havens are able to provide almost perfect secrecy. Another way they do this is through the use of trusts. In a trust, the person who pays the money is the owner, and they have to designate a certain goal for their fund. There’s also a professional manager called the trustee. The goal of a trust is that the money should be paid back to the owner or their relatives after some amount of time. The trustee is often a professional lawyer who manages hundreds of trusts at once. Tax authorities can’t know who the owner is – they only know the registered trustee. Lawyers can’t tell anyone who their beneficiaries are because that would be a breach of confidentiality. The real information stays hidden. What percentage of the world’s trade do you think passes through tax havens? The answer might surprise you: it’s actually more than half. Multinational corporations can basically choose how they want their profits to be taxed. If you buy a coffee from Starbucks, for example, Starbucks profits. But who generated this profit, and who should get it? The individual café? The coffee plantation? Starbucks argues that the profit was generated by their brand. After all, you don’t just want coffee – you want the Starbucks experience. So Starbucks can establish a separate subsidiary that owns the rights to its brand, and the main Starbucks company pays money to the subsidiary in order to buy the “right” to use its brand. The company pays a cost while the subsidiary is the one that profits. Corporations also use accounting tricks to shift their profits and “taxes” into tax havens. Starbucks can even legally establish their subsidiary directly in a tax haven. That makes it hard to know how much the brand rights are really worth, because the Starbucks subsidiary can charge Starbucks any amount they want for them. So the subsidiary is supposed to be the one paying the taxes, but the tax rate is nearly zero because it’s in a tax haven. Rupert Murdoch’s media empire rather poignantly illustrates the wizardry of these accounting practices. Neil Chenoweth, an investigative journalist, found that News Corp – which owns Fox News, MySpace and the Sun – reported their profits in 1987, 1988 and 1989 to be A$363,000, A$464,000 and A$496,000 respectively. Those numbers are absurdly low for such a mega corporation. The journalist John Lanchester put it well: “That little grace note in the sums is account-speak for ‘Fuck you.’” How can anyone possibly defend tax havens? People often claim that tax havens facilitate healthy tax competition, or that secrecy helps people protect their money from greedy autocrats. These arguments are quite shallow. “Tax competition” is just not a logical concept. Firstly, tax havens just create a free ride situation for people who use them. People and companies still benefit from their home country’s services, but they don’t pay for them. Secondly, high taxes are not a threat to competition in the first place. Countries compete with their education and institutions, as well as their economic and political stability. The World Economic Forum uses these indicators to rank the competitiveness of all countries in the world. Finland, Sweden and Denmark – which have the highest taxes in the world – are ranked fourth, fifth and sixth. Sometimes people also try to use moral arguments to support tax havens, but they don’t hold up either. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute argues that Switzerland provided a safe place for Jews to store their money during the Third Reich. This story is often used to support tax havens, and it’s untrue. The Swiss law that makes it a crime for banks to release their customers’ data was a response to a scandal where someone revealed a list of French people who had Swiss accounts. The law was proposed in 1932, a year before Hitler came to power. It was passed in 1934, two years before Nazi Germany stipulated that having undeclared foreign accounts was punishable by death. It’s really no wonder that the arguments in favor of tax havens don’t withstand scrutiny. The only real purpose of tax havens is to give wealthy and powerful elites another way to stay wealthy and powerful. Further defenses of tax havens only get more absurd. Tax haven apologists argue that secrecy protects powerless people against greedy big governments. This isn’t just wrong – it’s the opposite of what’s true. Tax havens help elite foreigners, not ordinary citizens. They usually ring-fence their economies away from the services they offer, meaning they only provide low tax rates and secrecy to non-residents. Residents have to pay normal taxes similar to those of countries that aren’t tax havens. Tax havens implicitly admit that the world can’t function without taxes. If everyone paid close to zero taxes, no one would have a fire department. The accounting firms, lawyers and banks who serve as intermediaries for tax havens charge such exorbitant prices that their services are only profitable if you already have a lot of money. Rudolf Elmer, who worked for banks on Mauritius and the Caymans said the minimum amount they’d hide was €3 million. Tax havens are simply a tool for elites to maintain their money and power. They also provide large corporations with a competitive edge over small- and medium-sized enterprises. Consider the idea of deferred taxes. Profits held in tax havens aren’t taxed until they’re repatriated – sent back to the country they came from. So when big companies use tax havens they do have to pay their taxes at some point, but not when they’re actually due. They essentially get interest-free loans from the government. Tax havens also allow wealthy people to pay less tax than they should. In fact, in 2006, billionaire Warren Buffett had the lowest tax rate of all those in his office staff, including the receptionist. In 2009, the Tax Justice Network published their Financial Secrecy Index for the first time. Some obvious candidates took the lead: the UK, Cayman Islands, Switzerland and Luxembourg were in the top five. But can you guess which country was considered the world’s most important secrecy jurisdiction? The United States! The United States has a rather ambiguous stance on offshore tax avoidance. The Carter administration created the Gordon Report, which was the world’s first major survey on secrecy jurisdictions. It condemned tax havens and called on the United States to lead the world in a global crackdown. It was published only one week before Ronald Reagan was inaugurated. He supported low taxes and a small state. The Gordon Report was buried almost immediately. Later, the Clinton administration proposed regulations that would provide OECD countries with information about bank deposits owned by American citizens. Once again, the proposal was later dropped – this time by the Bush administration, which also favored low taxes. The United States even has domestic methods of obscuring and avoiding taxes. States like Delaware provide immense corporate secrecy. You can create a shell company in Delaware for less than a thousand dollars. You don’t have to provide any information on what the business is, or who the directors or owners are. You can simply use the name and address of an agent in Delaware who administers thousands of similar companies. As we saw earlier, that agent can be a lawyer who can withhold any information from authorities due to attorney–client privilege. Barack Obama once criticized Ugland House on the Cayman Islands for housing over 12,000 companies. Anthony Travers, the chairman of the Cayman Islands’ Financial Services Authority, responded by suggesting Obama focus on Delaware instead – a single office at 1209 North Orange Street, Wilmington, houses 217,000 companies. The British Empire disintegrated throughout the twentieth century as its various colonies gained independence. Close political relationships remained, however, and in the second half of the twentieth century, these relationships formed a critical system of tax havens. The British system of secrecy jurisdictions is a web with three layers. The first layer consists of three crown dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. They’re still substantially controlled by the UK, but they’re independent enough that the UK can deny any responsibility if another country complains about them being tax havens. The second layer consists of the 14 overseas territories, and it includes some of the most famous tax havens. The Cayman Islands, for example, is part of this layer. The Cayman Islands are the world’s fifth largest financial center and one of the most globally infamous tax havens. The third layer includes secrecy jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Singapore and the Bahamas. This system has several purposes. It essentially works like a spider web that launders money. Just as a web catches insects, the British web catches money from nearby countries. It attracts money, then launders it and funnels it back to London, where it’s invested. Imagine a well-known Mexican drug lord who wants to invest his money in something legal. He can’t just go to London and deposit drug money into an account. Instead, he might pay it to a trust in the Bahamas. That trust will then send it to another trust in Jersey, which could in turn invest it in a real estate fund in London. The British spider web is the largest system of its kind in the world. In fact, economists Richard Murphy, Ronen Palan and Christian Chavagneux have estimated that this web holds over a third of all international bank assets. Including London, it’s almost half. Have you ever wondered why some developing countries get billions of dollars in aid but don’t seem to improve? One reason for this is that corrupt politicians steal foreign aid using tax havens. The illicit outflow of money from developing countries is called capital flight. In 2011, Global Financial Integrity estimated that total capital flight from all developing countries was over $1.2 trillion in 2008. This number is greater than the total debt or official development assistance from developing countries. For every dollar of foreign aid they lost another ten. Their leaders take the aid and hide it in tax havens. The University of Massachusetts Amherst published another study on capital flight from 40 African countries between 1970 and 2004. It found that with interest, these countries’ capital flight amounted to $607 billion – more than two and a half times their international debt. The elites of other developing countries also get rich from tax havens. In the early 1990s, government bonds from countries like Argentina yielded up to 45 percent in interest. Michael Hudson, an economist, found that this foreign debt wasn’t held by bondholders in North America or Europe. Argentina’s debt was held by Argentinian insiders who operated from offshore centers. They knew the debt would be serviced because they were affiliated in some way with institutions like the Argentine central bank. A US Federal Reserve official once said of Latin American countries, “The problem is not that these countries don’t have assets. The problem is they’re all in Miami.” The scale of this problem is enormous. In fact, in 2007, the biggest source of foreign investment in India wasn’t the United States or some other wealthy country. It was the tiny tax haven of Mauritius, which had 43 percent of the total. The key message in this book: Tax havens are nothing more than tools for wealthy and powerful people to maintain their wealth and power. By allowing global elites to avoid their taxes, they further the gap between rich and poor. They also take an enormous toll on the developing world and make it even more difficult for small- and medium-sized business to compete with major corporations. Tax havens don’t help oppressed people or keep the economy more free, they do quite the opposite. Suggested further reading: Beyond Outrage by Robert B.

Increasingly, people from all over the world are moving to promising cities in pursuit of opportunities. But what is it that makes cities seem so promising to so many? Urban metropolises offer jobs, universities and cultural institutions. The sheer variety of things to do and see makes it more likely that you’ll find what you’re looking for in life in a city. Of course, cities also have their dark sides. Poverty and crime rates are higher in cities than in suburbs. What’s more, many urban centers have suffered serious economic decline in recent decades – just think of Detroit, which has come to symbolize the failures of modern America. Ultimately, cities are reflections of humanity’s greatest achievements as well as its failures. And in these blinks, you’ll learn what makes cities so essential for human progress. In the following blinks, you’ll also learn: why theater tickets and restaurant prices are cheaper in the city than in the countryside; why Britain's Prince Charles hates the modern skyscrapers of Chicago; and why living in an urban environment sometimes encourages criminal behavior. Whether Athenian thinkers creating the foundation for classical philosophy or Florentine artists ushering in the Renaissance, throughout history, cities have been hotbeds of creativity and progress. What makes cities so conducive to visionary thinking? Cities bring people together, enabling collaboration and thus the spread of knowledge. This lively process often produces unexpected and paradigm-shifting creations. Cities are such rich sources of inspiration that today, even though technology helps us exchange ideas and information regardless of our location, many of us still choose to cluster in dense cities. That’s because people prefer learning via face-to-face communication. Consider Silicon Valley: Even though the tech industry is highly connected through the internet, programmers and inventors still want to be in the same physical location as their peers. And as a result, since the world’s most talented software engineers are all concentrated in a tiny geographic area, there’s a natural sense of competition – which means everyone works that much harder to come up with the “next big thing.” This gets at an important point. Ultimately, human progress in cities relies on three things: small firms, smart people and global connectedness. Silicon Valley embodies this kind of environment, as did industrial Detroit. In the mid-twentieth century, it seemed there was a genius and a start-up on every street corner – think of Henry Ford, the Dodge brothers, Detroit Electric, General Motors – each obsessed with creating the next automobile innovation. In addition to all this human capital, Detroit was also connected to the outside world via a major railroad and a waterway. These connections not only enabled the constant flow of goods to the city, but also brought a stream of eager entrepreneurs. Although cities offer plenty of opportunity for work and innovation, that’s not all. As we’ll see in the next blinks, city dwellers also have a lot of fun. Although living in the countryside has its charms – especially if you enjoy being in nature – if you’re looking for stimulation and excitement, you have to enter the urban jungle. That’s because the creative connectivity fostered by cities doesn’t just produce better businesses, it also nourishes the arts and entertainment communities. Consider, for example, London’s blossoming sixteenth-century theater scene. As London expanded, it attracted many wandering theater groups. Since there weren’t any established drama schools, actors learned from each other. This community also produced many great playwrights such as Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare himself. Today, literary scholars have established that these three playwrights sometimes borrowed structures and ideas from each other, and often referenced each other’s work. Seen in this light, Shakespeare’s world-famous masterpieces weren’t the product of a single genius working in isolation. Rather, the playwright’s work was nurtured and enabled by London’s highly inspiring creative community. It’s also important to note that in addition to a rich creative community, there were also major financial incentives for theater groups to settle in London. After all, the city was chock-full of potential customers, thus allowing cultural institutions to cover their overhead costs. This is crucial, because making theater is very expensive, requiring a large stage, special lighting, sound equipment, good actors and more. Cities offer large audiences that can share these fixed costs, ultimately making tickets more affordable and accessible to everyone. This same principle also applies to cinemas, restaurants, opera houses, museums and other establishments, ultimately leading to greater diversity and more specialized products in nearly every aspect of life and leisure. Just consider all the different kinds of food you can eat in a city! In New York City alone, you can choose between four different kinds of Indian cuisine in the span of just three city blocks. So as you can see, living in a city is more fun than living in the countryside. But that’s not all: Did you know that living in an urban metropolis is also better for the environment? Here’s a surprising fact. When it comes to global warming and carbon emissions, living in a city is the environmentally responsible choice, for two main reasons. For one, city dwellers drive less. Public transportation is inexpensive and far reaching, and parking is often scarce, so city people opt for the bus rather than a traffic jam. And city dwellers also use on average less energy. Small urban apartments need less electricity, heating and air conditioning than do larger suburban homes. All in all, this leads to fewer carbon emissions from a city, and thus less global warming. Here’s proof. As one of the author’s studies shows, an average household in a high-density city uses some 687 gallons of gas each year, while a household in a suburb or village uses some 1,164 gallons per year – nearly twice as much. But despite the environmental benefits of city life, America continues to sprawl. Today, most middle-class families in the United States live in the suburbs but commute into a city for work. This kind of lifestyle is accepted as the status quo, as American cities were originally built around cars and highways. Historically, more money went toward building interstates than public transportation. As a consequence, studies show that the average car commute lasts 24 minutes, while the average mass transit commute takes twice as long – 48 minutes. Another factor precipitating suburban sprawl is that public policy has consistently subsidized new home developments with cheap loans. This creates another incentive for middle-class families to leave the city to build homes in the suburbs. Cities are often associated with poverty – you might imagine the slums of Mumbai as one example. And generally speaking, poverty rates are higher in cities. In the United States for example, the urban poverty rate is 17.7 percent. Meanwhile, the poverty rate is only 9.8 percent in the suburbs. But although that might seem like a drawback, in fact, poverty is a sign of urban vitality. Cities don’t create poor people, they attract them by offering benefits and opportunities. The author conducted a study which demonstrated this principle. When cities built rapid transit (like a metro system) in an area, poverty rates around transit stops increased. This doesn’t mean that transit stops are somehow bad and make people poor; rather, they demonstrate the extent to which poor people value opportunities for getting around without a car. And even beyond public transportation options, for economically disadvantaged populations, cities offer many advantages over rural areas. Cities help provide opportunities and promises of prosperity. Most importantly, they provide access to jobs. As we mentioned in previous blinks, cities are dense, which allows markets to flourish. This is true not only for creative markets (like theaters) but also for labor markets. Often, there is a wider range of jobs available in cities. This makes it easier to find work; some people are even able to find jobs that fulfill them or make use of their special talents. By contrast, rural poverty leads to stagnation, since there are fewer businesses, educational institutions, less infrastructure and often no or limited public transportation. Ultimately, these environments separate poor communities from the outside world. Furthermore, since rural areas typically have weaker labor markets, workers are also paid less. In fact, a study showed that on average, rural workers earn 30 percent less than city dwellers. So residents of the slums of Mumbai moved there of their own accord and may be even better off financially than they were in the Indian hinterland. This is all to say, maybe we should reconsider our perspective on urban poverty. But although there are many advantages to living in an urban metropolis, the world’s cities still face many challenges, as we’ll see in upcoming blinks. Although urban density does create tremendous opportunity, it can also lead to crime and disease. That’s because people interact with each other more frequently when they’re crowded in relatively small areas. This closeness and frequency of interaction facilitates the spreading of disease via infection and contaminated water. And moreover, the risks of disease grow when people are poorer, because they have less access to medical care and other resources. These challenges are significant and require public intervention. Even though it can be expensive, cities in the developing world have the responsibility to provide clean water and clean streets to promote health among their residents. Urban concentration poses another challenge for cities, that is higher crime rates. For example, in 1989 in cities with populations above 1 million, 20 percent of residents were victims of a crime. On the other hand, the same was true for only 10 percent of village inhabitants. Why is there more crime in cities? Well, for one, there are more potential victims. It’s far easier to steal someone’s wallet on a crowded subway station platform than on a lonely country road. Anonymity also plays a key role in urban crime. Most people would have a much harder time robbing their kindly neighbor, than a random stranger they don’t know and don’t care about. And there’s one more factor that contributes to urban crime. As we mentioned, cities attract the poor, and this population is also more likely to suffer from social problems that lead to criminal behavior. Although high crime rates are a challenge for cities, there are ways of dealing with it. Crime rates drop when cities hire more police and impose harsher criminal punishments, as people are less likely to commit crimes when there’s a high probability that they’ll face consequences for their actions. Many of the greatest cities owe their historic growth to industrialization, supporting gigantic factories that required thousands of workers. Those times are over. Today, these same cities are struggling amid globalization and industrial decline. Globalization has ultimately made it more profitable for corporations to shutter factories in Western countries and shift production to other cities with lower labor costs. Additionally, falling transportation costs allow companies to manufacture goods in Asia, for example, and still sell them profitably in U.S. markets. As a consequence, out of the 10 biggest American cities in 1950, eight have lost at least 16 percent of their population in recent decades. Such a decline has also occurred in former European industrial capitals, like Liverpool and Glasgow. How have cities coped with these economic shifts? Some have been able to reinvent themselves thanks to education and entrepreneurship. Consider New York City. In the 1970s, the city almost went bankrupt as it lost its edge in the garment industry to Asian manufacturers. But then, a sudden boom in entrepreneurship, mainly in the financial services industry, gave the city a boost. In 1981, for example, Michael Bloomberg got rich when he developed an information system that provided real-time market data. Businesses and innovations like Bloomberg’s helped spur the city’s economic recovery. But other cities, like Detroit, couldn’t cope with industrial decline. Like New York, Detroit faced a struggling core industry, the auto industry. But since the city was home to mostly unskilled workers without much education or creative energy, new industries didn’t emerge when the city’s car factories shuttered. Furthermore, Detroit failed to re-educate its residents to prepare them for other kinds of work. And to make matters worse, the city was dominated by a single company, General Motors. The monopoly stifled any competition that could have arisen out of smaller, creative firms. Combined, these factors had a devastating effect on Detroit. The city lost 58 percent of its population between 1958 and 2008. Today, 25 percent of those residents remaining are unemployed, and the city’s murder rate is one of America’s highest. Detroit has surely had a troubled history, but other cities have fared better in recent decades. So what are the factors that allow cities to succeed? Which cities have successfully handled post-industrialization? Could their stories help others? Let’s start with Boston. This city’s key to success is its superb educational institutions and the knowledge-based industries that have been incubated alongside. Like Detroit, Boston suffered from the loss of its manufacturing industries and the decline of its once-significant port. But unlike Detroit, Boston’s educational institutions produced many skilled workers, paving the way for ideas that helped reinvent the city. Boston’s cornerstones of intellectual might are Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both located in Boston’s metropolitan area, these universities are among the best in the world. Over past decades, these institutions have produced graduates that have gone on to form many companies in the information industries, such as engineering, computer science, management consulting and biotechnology, making Boston the thriving business center it is today. Vancouver, Canada, is another example of a successful city. In addition to its relatively well-educated population and clever immigration policy, there’s another, rarely considered factor that has contributed to Vancouver’s success – its beautiful natural setting and mild, pleasant climate. Vancouver is not only surrounded by breathtaking coastlines and mountains, but also there are many green spaces and parks located within the city itself. Furthermore, summers aren’t nearly as hot as in  more southern cities, or as brutally cold as cities located in the Midwest. And in addition to these quality-of-life benefits, Vancouver has succeeded because of its educated residents. A quarter of the city’s population has at least a college degree, a number that’s significantly higher than the average for Canada as a whole, which is 18 percent. Vancouver also supports an immigration policy geared toward attracting highly skilled immigrants. More than 40 percent of Vancouver’s population is foreign-born, and more than 50 percent of these immigrants have at least a college degree. Cities that have overcome the challenges of industrial decline face new problems, such as exploding costs for residential spaces. The problem: if cities are affordable only for the wealthy, they will eventually lose what made them attractive and experience significant population decline. When there’s surging demand for urban housing, there are only two possible outcomes. Either the cost of living rises, or a city builds new and affordable housing for low- and middle-income residents. Unfortunately, in many cities, strict construction rules obstruct new developments, making new building projects increasingly uncommon. Many European capitals, like London and Paris, curb the construction of housing, especially apartment highrises, to preserve the city’s older, historic architecture. In these cities, tremendous resistance meets the construction of any new building. For example, a proposal to build a modernist tower in London next to the eighteenth-century Mansion House created huge controversy. Even Prince Charles joined the fight, stating that the tower was a “giant glass stump, better suited to downtown Chicago.” Eventually, the project was scrapped. London has preserved many of its precious historic buildings, but as a result, it’s also extremely expensive to live there, as the demand for housing greatly exceeds the supply. But cities aren’t meant to be museums; to thrive, they have to change, which is why the development of affordable housing is crucial for a city’s continued growth and success. Consider Houston, Texas, which is now the fourth-largest city in the United States. Since 2000, the population has grown by more than 1 million. Today, Houston is attracting more new residents than trendy cities such as New York City and Los Angeles. One reason for its popularity is that Houston has liberal building policies, which allow many new houses to be constructed. Additionally, in 2013 Houston was named America’s top job creator. The key message in this book: Creativity and innovation thrive in cities, because when people live so closely together, knowledge and ideas are freely exchanged. Additionally, urban centers offer countless opportunities for an individual to achieve great things, and inspire everyone around them with his or her example.  Actionable advice Hungry? Go to a city. Since cities offer a large market of potential customers, ambitious restaurateurs and chefs are more likely to open up inside a large urban center. The competition between dining establishments means that you’ll likely get the best quality of food. And furthermore, since there are so many patrons to share the cost of overhead, restaurants are able to offer individuals more affordable fare.

O’Neil","summary":"During the 2016 US presidential primaries, a key plank of Republican candidate – and eventual winner – Donald Trump’s campaign was the construction of an immense wall along the Mexican border, ostensibly to keep out undocumented migrants from the United States’ southern neighbor. The proposal spurred reactions ranging from vociferous support to fierce criticism, showing just how complex the United States’ relationship with Mexico is. And south of the border, the relationship isn't straightforward by any means, either. In these blinks, we will examine this dynamic relationship and how it has changed and evolved over the last decades. We will explore the possibilities and challenges Mexico is facing and how they can be tackled in concert with the United States. In these blinks, you’ll learn how United States’ news portrays a flawed image of the current situation in Mexico; why free trade is a good start, but won’t solve all of Mexico’s problems; and how immigration from Mexico into the United States has actually stalled since 2011. In 1997, Amado Carillo, an infamous drug lord and head of a major drug cartel in Juárez, Mexico, died in hospital while undergoing cosmetic surgery to disguise his identity. You can easily imagine what a juicy news headline this made and, of course, the US media ate it up. In fact, US news coverage of Mexico is primarily focused on drugs and crime. The city of Juárez is central to this narrative and the news of Carrillo's death is just one example of the American media’s obsession with the city. The focus on Juárez might be a result of the city’s location right along the border with the United States, just south of Texas and New Mexico. But it’s also a product of the city’s ludicrously high rates of drug-related crime. For instance, in 2009, there were over 2,500 violent, drug-related deaths in the city, the highest drug crime murder rate in all of Mexico. Just one year later, the number had risen to 3,000 deaths, making Juárez the most violent city on earth. Between 2007 and 2011, over 9,000 people were murdered by drug lords and dealers in the city. The American media is especially skilled at depicting all the tragedy and violence of the Mexican drug wars, but it misses the fact that the country has come a long way toward prosperity. While drug violence is still an issue, it shouldn’t overshadow the rapid progress Mexico is making in other areas. For example, Juárez is growing quickly, with new buildings and factories from well-known multinational companies, like Siemens and Bosch, emerging all the time. The city’s economic development has even been mentioned by Foreign Direct Investment magazine, a journal of the Financial Times Group. According to the journal, Juárez is a city with future prospects and a per capita income that’s above average for the country. Nowadays, lots of Mexicans live in the United States and many Americans, especially retired ones, move to Mexico to enjoy the warmer climate. This exchange makes it all the more essential for the two countries’ governments to find common ground. To their credit, the United States and Mexico have been working to improve their diplomatic ties for years. For example, in 2009, Carlos Pascual was named the US Ambassador to Mexico. Determined to strengthen cooperation between the two nations, he and President Barack Obama traveled to the Mexican city of Guadalajara for the annual North American Leaders Summit. From there, Pascual went on to Mexico City and then to Washington, where he worked tirelessly to build consensus between the two governments. One of Pascual’s primary ambitions was to foster support for a US-Mexico security strategy that, instead of merely pursuing drug lords, would strengthen Mexico’s judicial institutions and address social changes in the regions most affected by drug wars. His strategy was ambitious and looked very promising, but, unfortunately, the countries just weren’t ready to cooperate. As a result, diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States remained turbulent, as major issues surrounding the strategy’s implementation quickly came to light. The Mexican governors and ministers didn’t want to do things the American way and instead stuck with their old methods of military and police raids. Then, in 2010, WikiLeaks released confidential messages sent by Ambassador Pascual and his team, analyzing the Mexican government’s security apparatus. The analysis was largely critical, pointing to infighting between various authorities, as well as widespread corruption and human rights violations. Naturally, Mexican President Felipe Calderon was furious about the reports and criticized the American government as poorly coordinated. In the end, Ambassador Pascual, who had done a tremendous amount to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries, was forced to resign in March of 2011. Mexico’s oil industry has long been one of the country’s primary sources of wealth, which meant serious trouble in the 1980s when oil prices suddenly tanked. This market crash had far-reaching effects and produced a wave of immigration, with Mexican citizens flooding into the United States. It all started in 1982 when Mexico’s currency, the peso, was devalued by 40 percent over the course of just a few months. As a result, Mexico couldn’t afford to pay interest on its foreign debt, which at the time amounted to $80 billion; in turn, the peso lost even more of its value. The Mexican economy was plummeting, as was the number of jobs available in the country. In a desperate attempt to flee poverty and unemployment, huge numbers of Mexican immigrants entered the United States every year. The number of border crossings doubled once in the 1980s and again in the 90s. But despite this long history of Mexican immigration onto their soil, the United States still struggles to accept and acknowledge Mexican immigrants. Just take a Pew Research Center Hispanic Study that came out in March of 2005, which found that there were over 6.5 million Mexicans living in the United States in that year without any type of legal recognition. This is a huge problem, since, for example, more than 100,000 children of illegal Mexican immigrants have earned diplomas from US universities, but are then unable to work since they don’t have papers. To tackle this problem, in 2012, the Obama administration made the decision to halt deportations of illegal immigrants and give work visas to children who were brought into the United States before the age of 16. Subsequently, congressional legislation known as the DREAM Act went even further. It gave provisional, and eventually permanent, citizenship to all immigrants who arrived in the country before the age of 16, as long as they lived in the United States for at least five years and had earned a high-school degree. Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI in Spanish, first came to power in 1929. The party was monopolistic, corrupt and had to use gerrymandering to maintain elected office. So, it’s no surprise that the Mexican people eventually began protesting against this authoritarian government. This wave of protest emerged in the 1990s and, by 1994, Mexico’s expanding middle class felt utterly abandoned by the PRI as the peso crisis continued. When protesters amassed in front of the Bank of Mexico, burning their credit cards in an act of defiance, it was welcomed as a sign of positive change for the country; things were finally shifting from apathy to rage and the government would be forced to make changes. That same year, 3,000 men and women, dressed all in black, donning ski masks and carrying guns, appeared on the Mexican political scene. This was the Zapatista National Liberation Army, led by the enigmatic masked figure Subcomandante Marcos. They organized demonstrations in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, in the state of Chiapas, demanding a halt to the violation of indigenous and poor people’s rights. When the Mexican army attempted to stop them, the Zapatistas retreated into the jungle, finding ways to disseminate their message from there. Finally, in 2000, thanks in large part to this growing public pressure, Mexico held its first truly democratic elections. The president at the time, Ernesto Zedillo, was not keen on the violently repressive tactics his party had previously used to maintain power. Zedillo was ready to accept political reform and, in 1996, the electoral system experienced sweeping changes. Up until that point, the electoral institute had been entirely run by the government’s ministry of the interior – but after the reforms, it became an independent body run by citizens. Due to these reforms, the 2000 presidential race saw the election of the opposition candidate, Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, or PAN. For the first time ever, control of the presidency had democratically changed hands in Mexico. Immigration remains a hotly contested issue, as people from different countries and cultures often experience misunderstandings and can have trouble finding common ground. But when it comes to international economic exchange, everyone stands to benefit. Just take the Mexican economy, which has grown more robust in large part thanks to international trade agreements. The first such agreement was the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, a deal between Canada, the United States and Mexico, which some politicians began lobbying for as early as the 1980s. A central facet of the deal was to do away with border taxes on imports and exports while protecting the intellectual property rights of entrepreneurs. Sure enough, when NAFTA was signed in 1992, trade between the three countries increased rapidly, while their economies grew faster than in the years prior. For instance, by 2011, Mexico was exporting five times more products to the United States than it was before NAFTA, while US exports to Mexico had risen fourfold. In Mexico’s case, this meant a boost to direct foreign investment, which was a huge development for the manufacturing sector and in turn made Mexico Latin America’s largest exporter. But this liberalization wasn’t enough to solve Mexico’s economic problems. While it might have given the country a trade advantage for a certain period, when other countries, such as China, strike their own free trade agreements with the United States, that advantage will dwindle considerably. Because of this distinct possibility, Mexico has to deal with its other economic problems sooner rather than later. The main one at the moment is that the country is dominated by a handful of major companies. Without competition, these firms freely inflate their prices. For example, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s, estimates from 2010, Mexican families pay 40 percent more than they should for basic household goods. To reign in these huge corporations and cut prices, Mexico needs to toughen its economic regulations and deter such monopolistic tendencies. Just consider Mexico’s telecommunications market, which is dominated by two companies: Telmex and Telcel, both of which belong to a single multibillionaire by the name of Carlos Slim. Most people know that recreational drugs are commonplace in Western countries. But the relatively harmless aspects of recreational drug use, primarily involving teenagers eating too many Cheetos, is counterbalanced by a much darker side. Over the last 30 years, Mexico has become a major hub for drug trafficking. It used to be that the primary path by which drugs like cocaine entered the United States was from Colombia, through the Caribbean and into Miami. But in the 1980s, the United States spent billions of dollars to tighten up security along its southeast coast, effectively cutting off this route. With massive demand and no supply, the drug trade shifted its business to Mexico. While the country initially served as a mere alternative path for Colombian drugs, Mexicans soon began building their own drug cartels to cash in on the huge profits of this new business. As a result, today, 90 percent of the cocaine that arrives on US soil comes from one of the big Mexican drug cartels. Not only that, but Mexicans also trade in a huge portion of the marijuana and heroin that crosses the US border, while also playing a key role in drug shipments to other continents. As you might imagine, the booming Mexican drug trade comes with a concomitant escalation in violence. In fact, in Mexico, the transportation of drugs caused violence right from the start, as drug cartels quickly butted heads. However, until the 1990s, the situation was relatively controlled, since the drug dealers had made agreements with the corrupt authoritarian government. But when opposition politicians assumed office in the late 90s, the drug cartels could no longer rely on the government for immunity and violence erupted. For instance, in Chihuahua, murders jumped by 60 percent in the two years following the 1992 election of a National Action Party governor. And when Felipe Calderòn was elected president in 2006, he declared war on drug trafficking, prompting continued and escalating violence between drug lords and the police. Have you heard about the American citizens who take it upon themselves to patrol the Mexican border? Their intention is to control the flow of immigration, but this tactic is by no means sustainable. Instead, the United States and Mexico need to foster greater collaboration on the issue of immigration. The first thing that needs to be done is to speed up the process by which immigrant families are reunited. An easy way to do this would be to allocate family-based immigration visas to the immediate family members of naturalized US citizens. After that, the legal flow of immigrants should be set to meet the needs of the US labor market. To accomplish this, the United States should be more flexible with the number of work and permanent visas it issues each year. As it stands, the United States uses a fixed quota system of visas that doesn’t account for the fluctuating needs of the market. It’s only rational that when more foreign workers are needed, more visas should be granted. And finally, the United States needs to enforce existing labor laws by cracking down on employers and employees in the black market. Beyond the need to handle the immigration issue, the United States and Mexico can also strengthen their economic ties, bringing mutual benefits in the process. While Mexico enjoys booming manufacturing and export industries, it’s sorely lacking in infrastructure. For instance, El Paso, a city on the border with the US state of New Mexico, has a railway network that’s over 100 years old and can’t keep up with the rapid pace of exports to cities in the American South. To help out, the United States can play a crucial role as an investor by supplying the billions of dollars it will take to build new airports, highways, ports and railroads. In exchange, the United States will gain access to Mexico as a cheap, ideally located place for building factories and manufacturing goods. In July of 2012, Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI, which held Mexico back for so many decades, was elected president of the country. However, it quickly became clear that the party would no longer impose an authoritarian socialist regime. In fact, the latest indicators point to a Mexico that is both democratic and prosperous. For instance, during his first year in office, Peña Nieto introduced 16 reforms, all on important issues. The first dealt with education by ending the long-held Mexican custom of families buying or inheriting positions at schools. In its place, a federal census was formed to calculate student and teacher numbers in the country and evaluations were adopted to monitor the quality of education. From there, the government took on the corporate monopolies. To do so, they passed new laws, empowering regulators to better control large media and telecommunications firms that abuse their power. One such law states that companies owning more than 50 percent of a particular market must share their infrastructure and pay higher fees to boost their competitors’ chances for success. Going forward, there are still decisive changes to come, including political and economic reforms. One of these crucial decisions, to be made by Mexico in the coming years, is whether or not to allow the reelection of politicians. This is a fundamental issue because, right now, politicians in the country can only be elected for a single six-year term, which means they have no incentive to keep the promises on which they campaigned. If reelection becomes a reality, it should encourage greater accountability and long-term thinking among the country’s elected officials. Another important reform now under consideration would open up the Mexican energy market to foreign investors. Such a change would make a big difference since the country’s national energy company Pemex remains under firm governmental control, with all investment approvals going through the national treasury. If this reform passes, energy companies in the future would be in control of their own budgets and investments, attracting billions of dollars in foreign investment.

Now, it’s more like late afternoon. The luxury of giving up work for leisure is a recent development for humanity. We haven’t always had the chance to choose a year when we could stop working and spend our time doing whatever we feel like doing. Although that dream was possible for a few decades after World War Two, the huge population of Baby Boomers now approaching retirement threatens to exhaust America’s Social Security funds and lead to a demographic crisis. Unretirement is the answer. Not only is it a viable alternative to retirement, it can also solve America’s pending welfare crisis, inspire retirees-to-be and help the economy as a whole. After reading these blinks you’ll have learned what unretirement is, and how you can start preparing for it; why it’s so hard to save enough for retirement; and why BMW is preparing its factories for older workers. What comes to mind when you think about ageing? These days, we often immediately think of our retirement. However, it wasn’t too long ago that the elderly didn’t have this option at all. Until the Industrial Revolution, a retirement that involved receiving money after ceasing work was only possible for a small handful of groups. War veterans and widows received pensions, while all others without a family network to support them were expected to continue working or face poverty. It wasn’t till the early 1900s that the first retirement options emerged, but even these were largely private and inaccessible, used as incentives by railroads and factories to encourage workers to remain with their company for as long as possible. If you left your company or went on strike, your retirement pension would be revoked, and could even be declined on other grounds, such as excessive smoking or drinking. Retirement as we know it in America only developed during the Great Depression, a time when many people, let alone old people, were driven into penury and struggled to get by. In response, the Social Security Act was created in 1935, ensuring the elderly would receive at least some support from the US government. But this helpful support network soon spawned idealistic visions of retirement, in which the elderly idled away their days in leisure. Communities such as Sun City in Phoenix emerged, essentially as amusement parks for the resident pensioners. Yet even after the Social Security Act, retiring wasn’t so pretty for everyone, as many people were either uninsured or didn’t work for a company long enough to get all the benefits. And today, while we hold the same dreams of a retirement in paradise, we too may not be able to afford all that we hoped for. How do you feel about your job now? Perhaps you love it and can imagine working there for your whole life. But who knows, you might get to 60 and realize you want to spend the rest of your days doing what you really love instead. More often than not, you won’t have saved enough money to support yourself. This is a common mistake many make, by underestimating when they will retire and how much they’ll need to save. And when we don’t prepare ourselves adequately, we rely on the social system to support us. But our changing demographics may no longer allow this. Today, we have an ageing society. This demographic trend began after the huge Baby Boom which followed World War Two, and when subsequent generations produced fewer children. Now, the elderly proportion of the population continues to grow. In 2012, 13 percent of the American population was over 65, but by 2030, this figure will rise to 25 percent! These alarming demographic trends mean that our social systems will soon have to support far more retirees than they can afford. In fact, it is estimated that Medicare and Social Security will cost as much as half the total federal expenditure in 2030. Moreover, there are fewer young people working and contributing to Social Security. For example, 50 years ago there were five workers for every retiree, but today this has shrunk to three. In 2035, it will be reduced to two. In short, we can no longer retire and expect society to take care of us. If this all sounds pretty bleak to you, take a look at the following blinks. An alternative approach might stop ageing being such a terrifying prospect after all. All these predictions might make you feel gloomy about the future. But first, consider the possibilities offered by a new approach: unretirement. Unretirement means well-educated and healthy people continuing to work past the “traditional” retirement age. They needn’t stick to the same career, but they also needn’t squander perfectly productive years on the golf course. Instead, they can embrace their passions and skills by applying them to a new career, and live the third chapter of their lives to the fullest. In order to do this, we must first overcome some prejudices against older workers. Perhaps you already have an image of some of your older colleagues, whom you see as narrow-minded, unable to adapt, uncreative or even crotchety. This is simply not the case. Consider that the Baby Boomer generation is one of the healthiest and best-educated in history. They have just as much potential to start new businesses or re-orient to different careers as their younger counterparts. Plus, they have the benefit of experience, credibility and a well-developed professional network. So instead of throwing away their potential, let’s recognize older workers as the key to our demographic crisis. Studies can already predict the benefits of keeping people in the workforce for longer. In fact, if those who are still fit to work continued to do so for as little as five years longer, the taxes generated would keep the social system solvent till 2045. And this doesn’t even take into account the productivity boost that unretirement brings – read on to find out more! How exactly will unretirement benefit our economy? Some of you might be thinking that keeping older people in the workforce will decrease the job opportunities for young people. Well, here’s the short answer: Nope! In the 1960s, men were worried that if women left the kitchen and joined the workforce, they’d take all the jobs traditionally reserved for guys. Now we know that women in the workforce have been incredibly beneficial. With a larger workforce came more income, more spending, more jobs and ultimately, more wealth for everyone. We’ll see the same effect if we incorporate the elderly into our workforce. Keeping older people at work will also create another change that you can benefit from directly. How? Through a shift in work atmosphere. Older workers value variety and flexibility. They’d like to start something new and more fulfilling, with work hours that allow them to enjoy time outside the office, too. Sounds a lot like something you’d also value in your workplace, right? Well, if employers adjust work environments to older workers then you’ll benefit from this new professional climate, too. But why should employers make changes to suit older workers? Because it pays off. This was demonstrated by BMW when they experimented with assembly line workers who were an average of 47 years old. They didn’t perform as well as their younger colleagues at first, but things changed when BMW invested in adjustments like bigger screens with larger type and bigger gripping tools. With these small changes, the older workers’ productivity increased by seven percent, matching that of the younger workers. BMW expects that most of their workforce will be an average of 47 by 2017 – now that they’ve seen how to make changes to accommodate older workers in their company environment, they won’t be having any problems. Up until now, you might have considered keeping elderly people in the workforce a cruel necessity driven by a potential economic crisis. In fact, it’s anything but. The financial difference made by working a few more years is astonishing. Remember how most people fail to save for their retirement and rely on Social Security? Well, for starters, the Social Security benefits you receive are a whopping 75 percent higher if you retire at 70 instead of 62. And as you work, you can continue to save money, instead of draining your savings account. You’ll also need to put by less. Think of the calculations: If a couple earns $100,000 annually, they’ll need $66,000 after taxes to live at the same standard. If they retire at 62, they’ll only get $25,000 in Social Security payouts per year, so they’d need savings of $891,000 to live comfortably until their projected death at around 84 years old. But if they waited just four more years and retired at 66, their Social Security payout would increase while their savings remained intact. Therefore, they’d only need to save $552,000 to live the rest of their lives out in comfort. Wait till 70 to retire and the sum falls to $263,000! While these numbers are promising, work is also more than just income. It’s a virtue, and elderly people thrive on it like anyone else. In the modern world and in the United States in particular, a strong work ethic is highly valued. People live to work and even the wealthy encourage their children to be industrious. Work isn’t just a chance to pick up a paycheck. It also allows people to build bonds with colleagues, channel their creative energy, and make a difference. What could be better for elderly people who often feel alienated from society? So if you’re now thinking that you don’t want to head straight to the golf course at 62, read on for some tips about your future unretirement. Too many of us think of retirement as some final and irreversible event. It really needn’t be that way. An abrupt end is far more painful than a slow transition. People with a strong work ethic who live for their job find it especially hard to part from their colleagues and daily routine. Even if you’re not a workaholic, a sudden end to a decades-long career is no easy thing to cope with. Instead of calling it quits as soon as you hit retirement age, aim for a slow transition. Today, around 50 percent of older workers switch to part-time or contractual remote working, to test the waters of retirement and see if they’re ready for the shift in lifestyle. Yet many are still attracted to the idea of a retirement as soon as they can get it. To them, it’s not the simple fact of working that repels them, but the job they do. Working past the typical retirement age sounds great to young people with lots of energy, but for older workers with an understimulating or overly stressful job, ten more years of clocking in are the last thing they want to contemplate. However, unretirement doesn’t mean simply staying in your rut. It’s all about using your full potential to contribute to society, and a great way to achieve this is by switching careers to something that inspires you. Say you’re a lawyer and sick of the long hours and stress – this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to retire. Instead, why not start a coaching program for young people? Or begin learning some new skills. Pat Snyder, a former reporter, gives us a great example of reorienting in life – she received her master’s degree in applied positive psychology at the age of 66. Remember: You’re not alone with unretirement. There’s a whole generation of boomers out there trying to figure it all out. Read on to see what changes we as a society can make in order to make this transition easier. Since society can gain so much from unretirement, shouldn’t society in return be helping the elderly transition into it? Of course! Let’s start with political change. We’ve seen how people struggle to save enough for their retirement years and still retire too early. As this phenomenon directly impacts the Social Security system, it would surely make sense to counter it. How? By changing the way we perceive retirement, turning it into something to plan as thoroughly as your education. Statistics show that a mere 42 percent of workers have pension coverage via their job. Even they aren’t safe, because many switch jobs and thus can’t be sure they’ll accumulate enough savings for their retirement. And although the increased financial benefits are an incentive to retire later, there’s not much else to motivate people to keep working. So what about bonuses that specifically reward later retirements? A targeted approach by the government could prove highly effective in making well-planned retirements the norm. Another vital change must also be made in the way we conceptualize a “retirement plan.” Instead of thinking about how we’re going to use our money once we leave the office for good, it’s time to start thinking in terms of an “unretirement plan.” This simply means considering how you can fill the third chapter of your life with meaning, as well as living comfortably. So instead of meeting with accountants to discuss your 401(k), you should also think about what skills you’ve always wanted to learn, or what kinds of new people you’d like to meet. Of course, unretirement won’t change the world overnight, and it’s not some kind of a miracle cure for the economy. But it comes pretty close. The key message in this book: At retirement age people still have far more to offer society than has been previously thought. By becoming unretirees, they can stay active and boost not only the economy, but their overall quality of life too.   Actionable advice: Conceptualize an unretirement plan. As you come closer to retirement age, ask yourself whether you really want to withdraw from the workforce, or whether you simply want to quit the job that you hate. If the latter is the case, then take time to think about what you’ve always wanted to do, and consider how you can use your skills to make a difference. Your personal network can help you reorient yourself to a new and fulfilling career.

Looking at the world around you, you’d be forgiven for asking what’s gone wrong. In the United States, Trump has risen to power, riding a wave of popular discontent and anger at elites. Across Europe, populist parties are in the ascendancy. In emerging economies, people struggling with economic inequality, government corruption and a dirty environment are increasingly frustrated. In short, globalism has created winners and losers. These blinks tell the story of how the losers are starting to make their voices heard. It’s a story of anger, frustration and division. It's also a story of governments – in countries rich and poor – struggling to keep up with their citizens’ expectations. In these blinks, you’ll learn why immigration is driving populist politics; how robots will increase inequality between – and within – nations; and why governments need to rethink tax and education. For decades, Western political leaders have promoted globalism: the flow of ideas, commerce, services and people across borders. Globalism makes economies more efficient by moving production and operations to parts of the world where the people and materials are cheaper. That has helped people everywhere get wealthier – consumers in rich nations get cheaper goods on shop shelves, and workers in developing nations get access to new jobs. But there have also been many losers, as companies have moved jobs abroad or simply automated them. Since 1979, for example, the US has lost almost 40 percent of its factory jobs. The American middle class, traditionally the country’s economic majority, is declining. In 1970, middle-income households earned 62 percent of income in the United States. In 2014, that number was 43 percent. These impacts of globalism are having an effect on our society and politics. A growing sense of economic insecurity is driving dissatisfaction, and, in turn, populist movements. For example, polling conducted in 2015 found that only 6 percent of people in the United States, 4 percent in Britain and 3 percent in France believed the state of the world was getting better. Populist politicians of the left and right are tapping into this sense of frustration with an “us vs. them\" message. It sets \"us\" against \"them\" – \"us\" being the working and middle classes, and \"them\" being elites, immigrants, or both. You can see this “us vs. them” paradigm from the left, when Senator Bernie Sanders or the Greek leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras talk of big corporations, exploitative bankers and the political elite. From the right, we’ve seen how the impact of globalism, and, in particular, the sense of a threat to American jobs, has helped propel Trump into office. Trump was able to talk plainly to voters angry that their factories were shuttered, and jobs lost; while bankers in New York and politicians in Washington appeared to thrive, and Mexican and other Latin American immigrants found new opportunities. And though French far-right populist Marine Le Pen may not have won the French presidency in 2017, her election campaign looked a lot like Trump’s. She called for a “revolution” against open borders and the incoming foreigners supposedly stealing French jobs. As the popularity of figures like Le Pen indicates, this sense of us vs. them is not purely about jobs, but also about culture and nationality. Let’s take a closer look. Marine Le Pen’s rhetoric on immigration didn’t just target the threat to jobs and pensions, or the impact on public services. She also warned of a dilution of France’s cultural identity amid an influx of foreigners. In many countries, concerns about immigration are driving frustration and huge political upheaval. The proportion of UK residents born outside Britain rose from 3.8 million in 1993 to 8.7 million in 2015, more than doubling as a result of the European Union’s system of free movement for people. And the 2016 Brexit campaign successfully tapped into anxieties about this influx. Boris Johnson, one of the campaign’s leaders, argued that uncontrolled immigration creates “huge unfunded pressures” on the health system and other public services. Foreigners aren’t just taking your job, in other words, they are making your schools more crowded, and the line at the doctor’s longer. In Germany, 1.1 million migrants applied for asylum in 2015 and 2016 alone. The resulting societal concerns were the prime reason for Alternative for Germany becoming, in 2017, the first far-right party to win seats in the German parliament since World War II. Electoral successes for populist parties and platforms show how concern regarding immigration is driving shifts in opinion and values. Diversity and tolerance are more frequently being called into question. In 2015, at the height of the migrant crisis, French newspaper Le Figaro published a poll finding that a majority of Western European voters favored ending the current system of open borders between 26 European nations. Overall, hostility to immigration and foreigners has risen, and the underlying trends are likely to continue. In 2016 there were over 65 million people living as refugees around the world, and there are few signs of any political solutions that can make that number go down. Terrorist attacks that drive anti-Muslim sentiment are unlikely to disappear. Trump’s border wall, if built, will not keep out every migrant. Rising immigration, combined with an economy and society that feels more fragile than ever for middle- and working-class people, means that populism in Europe, the United States and other developed nations will continue to rise. And that’s a problem because that same fragility in developing nations is a key driver for the immigration impacting the rich world. And as we’ll see now, it’s on the rise. Few governments are as effective as the Chinese when it comes to suppressing protest. But according to official state figures, the number of protests in China nonetheless rose from 8,700 in 1993 to over 127,000 in 2010. At that point, the state stopped publishing the numbers. These protests were driven by a mixture of economic, environmental and political concerns either caused by or made worse by globalization. One immediate consequence of globalization has been industrialization, as factories and other industries were shifted to cheaper locations in developing countries. And with industrialization comes environmental damage, like dirty air and water. It’s estimated that one million Chinese people are killed by air pollution every year, causing understandable anger. In December 2016, people in the smog-filled city of Chengdu in China started placing pollution masks on the faces of statues in the city, and protestors took to social media holding photos that said, “let me breathe.” Signs of discontent in everyday life grew, too. Eventually, there were protestors filling the city’s main square, at which point, riot police launched a major crackdown. Other emerging nations have been victims of their own success, creating expectations among a new middle class that governments struggle to fulfill. Turkey has been a globalism success story. The proportion of Turkish people living in poverty dropped dramatically, from 30 percent to 1.6 percent between 2002 and 2014. But the country’s new middle class still has reasons to be dissatisfied. In 2012, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised that average income would rise to $25,000 by 2023. But by 2016, it stalled at just under $11,000. And as in many developing nations, the Turkish government has not used the proceeds of growth to invest in the infrastructure needed to keep its cities liveable as more and more of the population move from the countryside to urban areas in search of work. Failure to provide for public services can trigger massive outcries, as we’ve seen elsewhere. In 2013, in São Paulo in Brazil, a nine-cent increase in local transport fares – felt to be symptomatic of an inadequate, corrupt government – sparked huge protests across the whole country. Citizens around the world are more and more frustrated by environmental harm, disappointing economic results or poor public services. And as we’ll see in the next blink, these concerns are all intensified by a profound driver of anger: inequality. In the United States, the top 1 percent of adults earned 27 times what the bottom 50 percent earned in 1981. That’s already a big divide. But come 2016, the 1 percent earned a massive 81 times more than the bottom half of the population. Thousands of miles away, it only takes the richest man in Nigeria one day to earn more than 8,000 times what a poor Nigerian spends on their basic needs in a whole year. Economic inequality is present around the world, even in countries that have experienced significant growth. Take Russia. After the chaos of the post-Soviet period had passed, Russian incomes leaped between 2000 and 2010. But economic stagnation caused by weak oil prices has hit the poor hard since then. In response to tough times, the state stopped increasing pensions and public-sector wages in line with inflation. Poorer Russians have suffered a declining quality of life. Meanwhile, Russia’s political and economic elite has grown extraordinarily wealthy, and 24 percent of the country’s wealth is held offshore, where it can’t be taxed to fund public services. For comparison, the gap between rich and poor in Russia is wider today than in almost every OECD country. That’s a worry, in Russia and elsewhere, because inequality is a source of anger and often motivates unrest. Naturally, people become frustrated if they feel they are working hard for little return when they can see political and economic elites doing extraordinarily well. In Russia in 2017, anti-government protests featured protestors carrying yellow rubber ducks. This was a mocking reference to Prime Minister Medvedev’s extravagant and allegedly corrupt lifestyle, as he had built a duck sanctuary on one of his many lavish properties. In addition, people experiencing inequality lash out. In the US, an analysis by data-crunchers FiveThirtyEight based on publicly available FBI data found that income inequality “stood out” as a predictor of hate crimes. Both before and after the last presidential election, states with higher inequality were more likely to have higher levels of hate crime. The bad news is, there is a new force of globalism that has the potential to increase inequality yet further. It took half a century for the world’s first million industrial robots to be installed. It will only take eight years to install the second million. Robots, machine learning and other tech innovations are happening fast, and they are making more and more people’s jobs obsolete. A 2017 study from the Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis said that by 2035, almost every large American city will see half its current jobs replaced by automation. If you work in food preparation, on a doctor’s reception desk, as an administrator, or even as a truck driver, your job is at risk. Economic theory has long indicated that the overall impact of automation is positive. Robots replace low-value jobs, but they also create new kinds of jobs paying higher wages. Robots take on the lower-level, badly paid work, while humans can move up the economic chain. But in 2017, researchers at MIT and Boston University found evidence that contradicts this theory. They found that robots had taken 670,000 manufacturing jobs from 1990 to 2007. But the lost jobs hadn’t been replaced – new, higher-value jobs for humans just weren’t being created quickly enough. So replacing all the jobs lost to automation isn’t easy. As low-skilled and medium-skilled jobs are lost to robots, people will need higher levels of education. Those who can afford it will still be able to get the education they need to survive in an economy with high levels of automation and become a software developer, for example, or a healthcare professional. But those who can’t afford it will face major problems. A laid-off automobile worker in Detroit might be looking at a bleak future – his job lost to robots and no money to pay for the education to survive in the new, automated world. Education is expensive. Tuition costs in the United States are rising at 6 percent per year, according to financial firm Vanguard. At this rate, a four-year college degree for an American born in 2017 will cost $215,000 at a public school and $500,000 at a private one. United Nations forecasts show that 47 percent of jobs in the United States are at risk from machine learning and automation. But if that sounds bad, consider the figures for emerging countries. In Nigeria, 65 percent are threatened. In India, it’s 69 percent, and in China, 77 percent. Now consider the total populations of these and other developing countries. Nigeria has 180 million, Indonesia 260 million, and China 1.4 billion. That’s a lot of people whose livelihoods are at risk. In the past, having a large and growing population was an advantage. For instance, India’s young population – half of all Indians are under 25 years old – has given it a growing and cheap workforce that has enabled economic growth. But the rise of automation has meant that fewer jobs are created even when the economy is growing, making the large labor pool a disadvantage. Emerging economies have a higher proportion of jobs at risk to automation, and larger, younger populations to take care of. So they are much more vulnerable to the problems of automation. Many also lack the ability to respond to it effectively. Rich countries like the United States or South Korea can afford to invest in high-quality education systems. But consider a country like South Africa. Economic growth is held back by, among other things, a legacy of poor investment in infrastructure. Bad transport infrastructure, for example, separates the inhabitants of poor townships and rural areas from jobs, which tend to concentrate in urban areas. And problems like this are compounded in a democracy that, for most of the last two decades, had only one major party, a government that tends toward corruption and consistently poor leadership. Inequality is high, as is youth unemployment, at 40 percent for black youth. The end result is a government that doesn’t have the money to invest in the education or research and development that could prepare South Africa’s economy and population for changes to come. Exacerbating the problem, populists – like populists the world over – increasingly pin the blame on foreigners. They accuse foreigners of stealing South Africa’s resources rather than seriously addressing the lack of investment that is preventing growth. So the future risk is that, as rich countries manage the impact of the tech revolution, countries like South Africa or Egypt, Indonesia or Venezuela, will get left behind. With citizens unable to benefit and hit by its impact on working- and lower-middle-class jobs, inequality and anger within these countries will escalate dramatically. Governments across the globe are grappling with the challenges created by globalism, from demand for infrastructure to cultural anxiety. How are they responding? Very often, governments are reacting against globalism’s openness, erecting new barriers to manage the flow of goods, information and people. Today, Donald Trump is the global standard-bearer for resurgent economic protectionism, but he is not alone. For example, UN figures for the number of non-tariff barriers to trade among southeast Asian countries have risen from 1,634 in 2000 to around 6,000 in 2015. Like the United States, developing countries are finding ways to protect their own interests. Governments are also erecting walls to stop the flow of information. Sometimes these walls are quite literal. China incarcerated 38 journalists in 2016, while Turkey imprisoned 81. But an even more efficient way to shut down flows of information is simply to turn off the internet. The Egyptian government became the first to shut off its country’s internet access during the Arab Spring protests but hasn’t been the last. Russia’s hard work to control information includes blocking online content as it wishes. Russia even developed a government-controlled internal internet – so if war comes, the country would be able to disconnect from the global internet and run its own state version. Finally, barriers to people are growing. According to the Economist, more than 40 countries have built fences or walls against their neighbors since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. It seems very likely that governments will get pickier about the immigrants they let in. As automation replaces many of the jobs traditionally held by migrants in wealthy countries, the economic argument for immigration will weaken. Opponents of immigration can argue that the US doesn’t need Latin American migrant construction workers when 3-D printers can print out the foundations for a new home in a matter of hours. As the focus of immigration shifts away from lower-skilled workers, entry rights may increasingly be up for sale. In the US, for example, visa programs already allow rich foreigners easier access to green cards if they invest in real estate. When people feel threatened and frustrated, it’s understandable that they react first by erecting walls to protect themselves. A better approach, though, would be to rethink what citizens can expect from their governments. What do you expect from your government in return for paying taxes and obeying the law? Law and order? Job opportunities? High-quality broadband access? The US Declaration of Independence promises all citizens the unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But many people today have higher expectations of their social contract, or the expectations they can have of their government. They expect the right to education, transport infrastructure, safe drinking water, medical care and the ability to access the internet among other things. Faced with the challenges raised by globalism, today’s governments need to think carefully about the social contract in a way that is meaningful in a globalized world. A key part of this should be education, which now has to be a lifelong process. The speed of technological change means workers will need to retrain, often and quickly. In Singapore, a government body called Workforce Singapore helps businesses retrain their staff, develop new skills and remain valuable to the company. The Singaporean government also provides every citizen aged over 25 with an \"individual learning account\" – money to spend on training in new technology. Other governments could learn from this approach. They will also need to rethink tax. An automated workforce means fewer incomes to tax. Bill Gates has proposed a tax on robots to fund worker retraining and the welfare costs of those displaced from work. Others, particularly in Europe, are considering the idea of a universal basic income, in which everyone, rich or poor, receives a modest income from the state. Their basic needs covered, citizens could then choose education, full-time work, participation in the so-called gig economy and freelance work, or caring for children or elderly parents. What is clear today is that the forces of globalism still have the potential to disrupt societies. Trump voters, protestors on the streets of China and European populists may all be angry – and they often have good reasons to be. The process of reinventing the social contract may not be easy. But in the long run, it’s a better approach than building more walls. The key message in these blinks: It’s not hard to dislike populists like Trump. But he didn’t create the us vs. them world that made his election possible. Many people in America, Europe and the developing world want change. And they feel that political and economic elites do not understand the real impacts of globalism. If we don’t take these people seriously, there are major problems ahead for society and for politics.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

For most of history, people would have regarded our lifestyles as utopian. So what is our utopia? When we imagine a better life, a better society, what do we see?  The problem is that we have stopped imagining altogether. In fact, we aren’t even considering some pretty basic questions: Why are we working harder and harder, even though we are richer than ever before? Why are millions still living in poverty, when we have the collective wealth to end poverty completely?  It’s time to re-embrace big thinking. It’s time to imagine a new utopia, not as an unworkable pipe dream but as a set of evidence-based, utterly deliverable ideas for how to reshape society and the economy so that all of our lives are radically better.  In these blinks, you’ll learn:  why giving people cash is the best way to help them;  why GDP is a fundamentally unhelpful measure of progress; and what single policy change could make the world twice as rich. For most of human history, life was, as the famous philosopher Thomas Hobbes wrote, “poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” For centuries, the human experience changed little and was tough.  According to estimates by historians, the average Italian earned around $1,600 in the year 1300. Six centuries later, after a passage of time that saw Galileo, Newton, the Enlightenment, the invention of printing, the steam engine and gunpowder, how much was that average Italian earning? Still $1,600.  But in recent times, economic progress has occurred at an astounding pace. Today, the average Italian is 15 times as rich as in 1880. The global economy is 250 times the size it was before the Industrial Revolution. Things are now moving so fast that the price of a single watt of solar power has dropped by 99 percent since 1980.  As a result, in just the last century, billions of humans have reached a level of stability and comfort that would have seemed utopian to our counterparts throughout history.  After centuries in which hunger was a fundamental part of most humans’ lives, today, there are more people suffering from obesity than from starvation. We’re also safer – the murder rate in Western Europe, for example, is a full 40 times lower than in the Middle Ages, smallpox has been eradicated, and today, because less disease means fewer early deaths, the average life expectancy on the African continent is growing at a rate of four days every week.  In addition, our grasp of technology is such that, to a visitor from the Middle Ages, it might seem as if biblical prophecies are coming to life: Consider the Argus II, a brain implant that restores some sight to people with genetic blindness. Or the Rewalk – robotic legs that are giving paraplegic people the power to walk again! Secure, healthy and rich by any historical standard, we are living in paradise. So why does that feel so bleak, and why are so many people still dissatisfied with their lot? Maybe it’s that with so much wealth, we’ve forgotten how to dream big. Blinded by our consumer comforts, we’re no longer thinking about making life truly better. The moment has come to consider again what progress and living a good life in a time of material wealth really means. Life was tough for Bernard Omondi. Working in a stone quarry in impoverished western Kenya, he was earning $2 a day – barely enough to get by. But life got a lot better when the charity GiveDirectly gave him and others in his village a one-off payment of $500, with no strings attached. Bernard used his windfall to purchase a motorcycle. Months later, he was earning $6 to $9 a day as a motorbike taxi driver. The money had transformed Bernard’s life.  GiveDirectly follows a simple principle: Cash-poor people know better than anyone else what they need. Therefore, the best way to help them is to give them money. Cold, unconditional, no-strings-attached cash that they can use as they see fit.  That’s an unusual approach because governments and NGOs usually believe they know what impoverished people actually need better than the people themselves do. Such thinking leads to programs in which villages receive cows, schools or solar panels. While, it’s better to have one cow than no cow at all, one study in Rwanda found that donating a single pregnant cow and providing a milking workshop cost $3,000! That’s the equivalent of five full years of income for the average Rwandan – a transformative amount.  There’s plenty of evidence that giving cash works. When poor Ugandan women were given $150, their incomes subsequently rose by almost 100 percent. An MIT study of GiveDirectly’s cash grants found that they drive a lasting 38 percent increase in incomes and boost home and livestock ownership by 58 percent. Programs around the world back up this approach. One reason that organizations are resistant to giving out free money is the entrenched belief that handouts will breed laziness and vice. The evidence, however, doesn’t support this.  A major World Bank study found that in 82 percent of researched cases across Latin America, Asia and Africa, alcohol and tobacco consumption declined among recipients of cash. One experimental study in Liberia saw alcoholics, known criminals and assorted other addicts given $200, condition-free. Three years on, the men had used their unexpected windfalls to invest in food and medicine and to start small businesses.  It turns out that poverty isn’t about stupidity, laziness or bad decisions. It’s about a lack of money. And as we’ll see in the next blink, this doesn’t only apply in the developing world but also in the Western world. Let’s take a look. Universal Basic Income, or UBI, is a scheme in which everyone receives just enough money to live on. It’s tax-funded, given unconditionally, and doesn’t require the recipient to work. It’s not a new idea – something very much like it was almost introduced in the United States by an unlikely supporter.  Before his disgrace, President Richard Nixon planned on giving every family $1,600 a year, or $10,000 in today’s money. It would be, he argued, the most significant social legislation in US history. In the end, facing political opposition in Congress, Nixon abandoned the idea. It seemed thinkable then, but UBI is certainly possible now.  UBI opponents from both the Nixon era and today, make two core arguments against it.  The first is that it’s fundamentally unaffordable. Which nation can fund handouts for everyone? Well, according to a study by British think-tank, Demos, eradicating all poverty in the United States would cost just $175 billion. Sure, that sounds like a lot, but it amounts to less than 1 percent of US GDP. A Harvard Study found that winning the war against poverty would be a whole lot cheaper than the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which between them cost $4-6 trillion.  The second argument made against UBI is that it would be dangerous. Give everyone free income, and we will see an explosion in laziness. Why work, when you can get free cash?  When President Nixon was pushing the idea, multiple trials were conducted across the United States to probe this very question. Their findings? Overall, paid work was reduced by just 9 percent – a figure which was later revised down when researchers discovered a methodological anomaly. Moreover, the people who accounted for that 9 percent were mostly mothers of young children who cut back on their working time, and young people who pursued further education. It was also reported that even high school graduation rose by a third among recipients. It seems that UBI is more likely to help people make good decisions. Just as Bernard in western Kenya used the free money to advance himself, recipients of a UBI in the United States were able to make sensible decisions, like investing in education, rather than decisions determined by economic circumstance and necessity.  With globalization and technology threatening our jobs, the time to introduce UBI has never been more ripe. All we need to do is be brave enough to think differently about how our economy should work. To listen to politicians or economic commentators, you’d think that gross domestic product, or GDP, was a wholly reliable measure of a nation’s well-being. In reality, though, GDP should no longer be trusted as a yardstick for a nation’s progress.  What is GDP? Well, it’s the sum of goods and services produced in a country, adjusted for things like seasonal variations and inflation. So far, so good. But there are a few fundamental problems with it. Firstly, GDP does a bad job of measuring technological advances. That’s partly because products that are free or cheap can have a transformative effect on business or society but nonetheless hurt GDP. Most of us would regard the free calling service Skype, for example, as representing progress. But it cost the telecom giants a fortune, and therefore dented GDP.  Secondly, GDP benefits from human suffering. While the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that left 20,000 dead in Japan damaged GDP that year, the subsequent recovery efforts boosted the economy. Consequently, GDP grew to 1 percent in 2012, rising still in 2013. So, are tsunamis good for the economy? The improving GDP would suggest so.  Surely then, the time has come for a new and more balanced approach that reflects what truly amounts to progress and welfare in a modern nation.  Some attempts at this have been made. The King of Bhutan famously made a switch to a gross national happiness measure that incorporated a wider assessment of society’s health, like knowledge of traditional songs and dances. It did, however, quietly gloss over any dissatisfaction with his dictatorial rule. A dashboard that quantified the health of a nation by a number of measures would work better than any single figure would. These measures wouldn’t just include growth and financial investment, but track the state of jobs, community service, environmental health and social cohesion.  Some might object that such a dashboard could never be objective. However, GDP isn’t either – it’s a subjective collection of judgments. A dashboard might, ironically, allow us to make a better assessment of what Simon Kuznets, GDP’s creator, thought was important: Not just the quantity, but the quality of growth.  One other factor that our dashboard could measure is leisure-time. Because, as we’ll now see, time is also something to be valued. In summer 1930, while giving a lecture in Madrid, the economist John Maynard Keynes made a striking prediction: by 2030, vast economic growth would mean a 15-hour workweek. Well, Keynes was right about rocketing economic growth, but why was he wrong about us working fewer hours?  Economic growth in the nineteenth and twentieth century did lead to some reductions in working hours. The capitalist-to-his-bones car manufacturer, Henry Ford, discovered that shortening his employees’ workweek increased their productivity. He happily told journalists that more leisure was a “cold business fact,” offering effective, rested workers who also had enough leisure time to buy and use his cars. And Ford wasn’t alone. By the 1960s, the Rand Corporation think-tank foresaw a future economy in which just 2 percent of people needed to work to meet all of society’s needs.  But by the 1980s, reductions in working hours stopped. Growth didn’t equate to more leisure but to more consumption. In countries like the United Kingdom, Austria and Spain, the workweek stayed the same, whereas in the United States it grew despite the fact that economic growth could enable Keynes’ vision. The MIT ecologist Erik Rauch has shown that, by 2050, we could work 15 hours or less while earning the same as we did in 2000, which was hardly a period of hardship.  The time has come to think again about putting in fewer hours at work. Doing so offers a wide variety of benefits. For a start, people want to work less. When researchers in the United States asked people whether they would rather have an extra two weeks’ salary or an extra two weeks off, twice as many chose the free time. And working less has myriad benefits, from reducing accidents in the workplace, to cutting stress levels, to emancipating women. Countries with the shortest workweeks top gender equality rankings. Why? Well, when men work less, they pick up more of the unpaid work at home that has traditionally been left to women.  A short working week would give us all the bandwidth we need to live a better life. Whether that means spending more time with the kids, learning to play the piano, studying a language or getting fit. Shortening our week needs to become a political priority. But as we’ll see, our society doesn’t always get its priorities right. In February 1968, 7,000 angry sanitation workers gathered in New York in response to failed pay negotiations. As one garbageman said, they were fed up of people treating them like dirt. They were going on strike.  In Ireland, in May 1970, the country’s bank employees went on strike following lengthy but unsuccessful wage negotiations. Two strikes by two very different occupations. What happened? Well, two days after New York’s sanitation workforce went on strike, the city was knee-deep in stinking refuse. For the first time since a 1931 polio outbreak, the city declared a state of emergency. It turns out you really need garbagemen; what about bankers?  Over in Ireland, the banks closed overnight. Pundits predicted economic doom. But then something odd happened: not much at all. Pubs and shops, well-integrated into their communities, filled the void and cashed checks. After all, pub and shop managers had a keen sense for their customers’ trustworthiness. A workable financial system emerged, and by November 1970, £5 billion in homemade currency had been printed and used. It turned out that some form of financial system was needed, but bankers themselves? Not so much.  Certain jobs bring wealth and prestige, like being a banker, a hot-shot lawyer or a social media strategist. Others, like being a garbageman or an ordinary school teacher, are badly paid and bring either no prestige or outright disdain. But the reality is, many supposedly hot-shot jobs create little wealth.  Take lawyers. Sure, the rule of law is important. But the United States has 17 times as many lawyers per person as Japan. Is America’s legal system 17 times better? No. Imagine that the 100,000 lobbyists operating in Washington, or the world’s telemarketers went on strike. If anything, we’d all be better off.  Society would benefit from refocusing on what actually creates wealth and value. Taxation is a good place to start. One Harvard study showed that tax cuts under President Reagan prompted a major switch in careers among the nation’s academic elite. In 1970, twice as many Harvard graduates were choosing research than banking. Twenty years later, following Reagan’s income tax cuts, the numbers had flipped. The conclusion was clear: income tax steers people away from high-paid but not socially beneficial occupations like banking toward roles with a more positive impact on society.  If we want engineers rather than hedge-fund managers, teachers instead of bankers, then higher taxes would be a good place to start. In the early nineteenth century, English factory owner William Cartwright introduced a new type of loom. Each machine replaced the jobs of four skilled weavers. In the following months, unemployed workers formed a radical faction intent on destroying machinery. Machines, said one rebel named William Leadbetter, “will be the destruction of the universe.” The group called themselves the Luddites. Throughout history, people have warned of the impact of machines on jobs. But today, most people would say that the Luddites and other fear-mongers got it wrong. After all, we aren’t all unemployed. Nonetheless, there are reasons to be more worried than ever before about the impact of technology on jobs.  Throughout the twentieth century, job growth and economic productivity ran side by side. As we got more productive, we also created more jobs. But around the start of the twenty-first century, a change occurred. Two MIT economists, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, call it the great decoupling. Productivity kept on rising, driven by innovation. But at the same time, job creation slowed, and median incomes fell. Why?  One reason is the sheer pace of technological change. Consider Moore’s law, which states that the number of transistors on each computer chip doubles year on year, and so does computing power as a consequence. When Gordon Moore, an IBM co-founder, discovered this growth pattern in the 1960s, there were just 30 transistors to a chip.  Well, when the Xbox One was launched in 2013, it had five billion transistors. Moore’s law isn’t showing any signs of slowing down, and some commentators expect staggering advances in computer technology in the near future.  A second reason why our economy is fundamentally changing is that technological growth and globalization means that tiny groups of people can now build vastly successful businesses. In the late 1980s, Kodak employed 145,000 people. It filed for bankruptcy in 2012, the same year that Instagram was sold to Facebook for $1 billion. Instagram’s workforce? Thirteen people.  In the nineteenth century, innovation in steam-powered technology replaced human muscle-power – in mills, mines and other industrial sites. Today, innovation in computing power is ready to replace our brainpower at a much faster rate. As a result, most jobs are now at risk.  Let’s take a look at the consequences, and how we might tackle them. It seems possible that the Luddites’ anti-technology fears weren’t wrong, though perhaps just a little premature; maybe we really are doomed to be beaten in our race against the machine. After all, we may be about to reach a tipping point in which developments in computing power and artificial intelligence radically change everything.  Futurologist Ray Kurzweil ardently believes that computers will be as smart as people by 2029 and that by 2045 they may be a billion times more intelligent than all human brains together. Now, Kurzweil is known for his wildness as much as his genius. But we should be wary of dismissing his predictions, just as we would have been wrong to dismiss Gordon Moore’s analysis of computing progression back in the 1960s.  And if Kurzweil’s right, we’ll see major economic change. What will the consequences be? One is rapidly growing inequality. A small group of ultra-rich will enjoy fabulous lifestyles, while anyone who hasn’t learned a skill that machines cannot master will be left to the side. Our society is becoming more divided.  Assuming we don’t want to live in a world with rampant inequality, what can be done? Traditionally the answer to the threat of machines has been to call for education. This has worked in the past, but then it was pretty simple to help, for example, farmers build their earning capacity by learning some basic skills. Helping our children prepare to compete with machines and artificial intelligence might be a little trickier.  The answer lies in rejecting a central tenet of modern life: the idea that we must all work for a living. Ultimately, the answer is massive redistribution. In a world characterized by Instagrams, not Kodaks, if we want everyone in society to benefit from technology-driven prosperity, we need to consider radical redistribution. That means taxation of the vast wealth accrued by an ever-smaller group of people.  The French economist Thomas Piketty caused an uproar when he proposed a global, progressive tax on wealth as the solution to growing inequality between the haves and have nots. Piketty himself describes his idea as utopian, but a “useful utopia.” But the choice is there for us to take. Accept increasing inequality or turn this utopia into a reality. Imagine there was a single measure that wouldn’t just ameliorate poverty but eradicate it? And imagine that measure would make all of us richer, as well? Surely we’d take it, right? Well, unfortunately, we probably wouldn’t. Not right now. Because that measure is to open all borders. Economists’ views on this are consistent. According to a Center for Global Development paper, four major studies predicted global economic growth of between 67 and 147 percent if borders were opened.  It’s common to hear economists urging the removal of trade and capital barriers to promote growth; the IMF estimates that lifting restrictions on capital movement would free up $65 billion – a tidy sum. But Harvard economist Lant Pritchett has estimated that opening borders to people would have one thousand times the impact: generating $65 trillion across the world.  Our current focus on aid and trade seems a little silly when open borders could boost the income of, for example, the average Nigerian person by $22,000 annually, according to John Kennan from the National Bureau of Economic Research.  So why don’t we open up? Well, national borders seem to distort our thinking. We are morally indignant to learn that white Americans earn more than black Americans, but we don’t bat an eyelid at the knowledge that an American will, for the same work, earn three times more than a Bolivian of the same age and abilities, and eight and a half times more than the equivalent Nigerian.  Today, the real elite aren’t those born into the right family or the right social class. They are those born in the right country. Today, a person on the poverty line in the United States is in the richest 14 percent of the global population. And someone earning a median wage in the United States is in the richest 4 percent. That’s after adjusting for the cost of living. Today, the global elite is barely aware of its luck.  But the status quo doesn’t have to be accepted. The strength of today’s national borders is a historical anomaly. Before World War One, borders existed mostly as lines on maps. Countries that issued passports, like Russia, were regarded as uncivilized for doing so.  So maybe we can imagine something different and better. One thing is certain. If you want to make the world a better place, you need to make it a more open place. The key message in these blinks: We have the wealth and the ability to improve our world radically. Moving toward a universal basic income, a far shorter workweek, better indicators of societal progress and opening borders would have a transformative, positive impact on our lives. We just lack the imagination to believe in this achievable utopia.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It’s also completely transforming the world and the ways we live in it, which is slightly scary. These blinks are about two tech developments in particular – platforms and algorithms – and how they’ve become the building blocks of almost all new technologies. From humble yet exciting beginnings to almost-global influence, their story is an exciting one. So get ready to learn how they work, what applications they have beyond science and technology and also how to handle any problems that may be – or already have been – created by them. You’ll also learn what a “two-pizza team” is; why algorithms are like Arabian djinns; and where machines have already taken over. Remember when you saw your first touchscreen phone or virtual-reality headset? Or when your first Uber car arrived at your doorstep? You may have thought, “WTF?” The new technologies just keep on coming – and they’re forever changing the world we live in. Two monumental developments are at the heart of the modern industry: artificial intelligence, in the form of algorithms, and modern digital platforms. Modern digital platforms are based on open-source software, which was developed in the 1990s. This type of software is free, and any user can access and edit it for the benefit of all – a model that’s diametrically opposed to closed-software platforms such as those used by Microsoft, who dominated the industry at the time by locking hardware developers into their operating systems. The shift began with the rise of Linux, and was highlighted in a 1997 paper by Eric Raymond called “The Cathedral and the Bazaar.” Rather than worshipping at the altar of Microsoft, Linux users worldwide, from hackers to developers, pooled their resources and encouraged the free trade of knowledge. This established a template for digital platforms, where the level of freedom and cooperation generates rapid growth. Modern companies such as Uber and Amazon are built around this model, acting either as hosts or as a marketplace to connect users But these platforms couldn’t operate at such a level of complexity without the algorithms that govern them. Every platform is run by multiple algorithms, each designed to complete a specific task. Computer algorithms can process enormous amounts of data in almost no time at all and manage complex functions that no human could handle, such as coordinating the vast Uber network of passengers and drivers. Once programmed, algorithms operate independently. Because of this, they’re often referred to as a sort of artificial intelligence, or AI. And their operations are only becoming more advanced. So, now that you understand the principles of these two developments, let’s take a look at the effects that they have on businesses and the world around them. First up: platforms. From Google to Amazon, Foursquare to Lyft, user-based platforms have proven immensely successful and lucrative. But what if you applied this model to other structures? Let’s find out with the help of Amazon, which is structured around many two-pizza teams – a phrase the company coined to refer to a team small enough to be fed by two pizzas. Each team has the freedom to pursue its own goals, and has a specific customer in mind, even if that “customer” is within the company. Basically, every team acts like an individual developer, each of whom contributes to the communal platform that is Amazon. Breaking the company up into many little teams, each performing a specific function, made it easier for Amazon to spot and pinpoint problems. The issue could then be fixed by readjusting the relevant team. Now that you understand what an autonomous-platform model might look like, imagine if it were applied to government? Traditionally, governments act as a sort of “vending machine.” Citizens put money in and, in return, are given access to a limited and predetermined selection of benefits: standard options for health care and education and welfare and so on. You get to choose, but you have no say in what you get to choose among. In contrast, if a platform-modeled government identified a problem, it wouldn’t try to solve it alone; rather, it would identify and then coordinate the parties required to fix it. This is a lot like the Apple App Store. Apple itself doesn’t build the bulk of the apps. It hosts a platform where users can find and exchange the services they require. In the same way, rather than presuming and dictating what would be best for people, a platform-modeled government would orchestrate the cooperation of its citizens when an issue arises, acting as a small government that provides big services.   The platform model may be the new face of technology, but it wouldn’t exist without algorithms. So how exactly might these affect business structures? Well, they’ve actually already begun influencing traditional business hierarchies. Indeed, Amazon’s two-pizza teams may well have been inspired by algorithms, considering how similarly they function. Like these teams, some algorithms independently monitor and regulate their own efficiency through what is known as a fitness function. They produce smaller programs to approach specific goals in different ways, and can then assess their efficiency and delete those that don’t perform as well, keeping only the best in service. Think of the way search engines work: they check which results are clicked on the most, learning over time that these are the most relevant and that whatever algorithm finds them is the most effective. This is based on evolutionary biology, and it’s basically a digital version of survival of the fittest: whichever algorithm outperforms the others will pass on its code, just as only the fittest animal species pass on their DNA. But there’s still a problem with algorithms. They’re not exactly practically-minded entities, and they still need human supervision. In fact, they‘re a lot more like the mythical djinns, or genies, of Arabia, who grant the wishes of those who ask, but creatively interpret them, to unexpected, and often troublesome, effect. So when you program an algorithm to perform a certain function, it will unquestioningly grant your wishes but remain utterly oblivious to any unexpected consequences or collateral damage that it might cause along the way. This obedience is akin to traditional factory models, except that algorithms have replaced the workers. Humans are essentially the factory managers, keeping watch over multiple functions and reprogramming any algorithms that act out of line. You’ve now seen where and how these technologies are restructuring business hierarchies. So the question becomes whether or not all of this is actually a good thing. In the next few blinks, we’ll look at some concerns people have about algorithmic technology. When you think of rogue AI, you might imagine HAL9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Skynet in The Terminator. But you can rest easy once the credits roll because these are a long way from reality. Right? Well, there are actually rogue algorithms already operating, and some of them are right under our noses. For example, the recent phenomena of fake news and filter bubbles are actually side effects of algorithmic technology. Like those rogue djinns, the algorithms controlling social media and search engines can only do what they’re told. However, they haven’t been programmed to spread honest journalism. Their sole goal is to maximize data traffic. As a result, your social-media feeds are probably full of content similar to that you’ve already reacted positively to. And, eventually, the algorithm will filter out all opinions different from those you already hold. These algorithms also disregard whether or not something is even true, as most of them can’t actually tell. This was made clear in the wake of the 2016 US election, when Facebook was accused of not doing enough about the spread of fake news articles. CEO Mark Zuckerberg at first denied this but eventually admitted it was a problem since algorithms just promote what is popular and trending. Though worrying, this problem seems more like a side effect of algorithms than out-of-control AI. But we’re also at the mercy of a much more frightening digital force that’s only out for its own gain: the modern financial market. Things started going wrong during the 1970s and 1980s, when shareholder value – that is, making money for the people who hold company shares – became the most important goal for businesses. This model ignores the human interests of goods and services – tangible things that we can actually buy – and focuses only on numbers. More recently, financial centers such as Wall Street were computerized to increase their speed and efficiency. Computers can spot market changes infinitely faster than humans can, so high-frequency-trading algorithms give traders the edge over others. However, these high speeds also put the market outside of human understanding and therefore out of human control. Together, these two developments have created a market where computers are working faster than we can comprehend, with the single goal of improving short-term profits, regardless of any human costs. You can see the effects in the relentless pursuit of GDP, as well as the uptick in recessions and financial crashes. And the worst part? This isn’t even malicious, just another djinn doing what it’s told! From bank tellers to ticket offices, you’ve probably seen the effects of automation, or at least heard somewhere that machines are taking our jobs. But is this actually happening? To some extent, yes. We’re currently unable to find new forms of work as fast as we’re making others obsolete. In the twentieth century, an economist called John Maynard Keynes referred to this as technological unemployment, and it’s responsible for much of our apprehension about technology. In fact, 63 percent of Americans feel that jobs are less secure today than they were two to three decades ago, and, as mentioned earlier, some workers are already being replaced by algorithms. Since computers can handle tasks at incredible speeds and with reliable results, it makes economic sense to use them instead of humans, who are notoriously – well – human. But technological unemployment isn’t the only change automation is causing. It’s also creating a different type of working condition: continuous partial employment. You can see this best in the role of Uber drivers, who straddle the line between secure employment and independent contractors. They don’t work in exchange for a regular paycheck or provide services to several companies. Rather, they work for a single employer whenever it suits them and for however long, and are paid accordingly. This is only made possible by platform- and algorithm-based structures. Technically speaking, Uber drivers are doing all the work, and the platform – managed by algorithms – simply puts them in touch with customers, before taking a cut of the profits. The resulting freedom may be good for some, but it is very insecure work, as Uber is not contractually obliged to give work or benefits to the drivers. So technology is clearly having a large effect on workforces, but maybe this isn’t a problem. In the next blinks, we’ll look at how these changes can be cultivated into a force for good. During the early nineteenth century, British weavers in Nottinghamshire intentionally destroyed many of the new machine looms that had recently been introduced because the machines were threatening their traditional craftsmanship. The weavers were following the example of the folk hero Ned Ludd, who’d supposedly done the same years earlier. This is actually the root of the word Luddite – someone who opposes technological changes. Their concerns were justified, and the new technology led to widespread unemployment, as described by John Maynard Keynes. But Keynes, speaking metaphorically, went on to describe this period of worker redundancy as “growing-pains” rather than old age – and, sure enough, employment did eventually bounce back. The traditional craftsmanship of the Luddites became factory work, and over time that became the office-based and service-sector jobs that we know so well today. So there is every possibility that our current disruptions are just the turning point toward a new dominant form of work. Rather than rejecting technological changes, we should try to embrace them and their potential benefits. One way to do this would be to work with rather than against the job insecurity of continuous partial employment, and not try to stamp it out. The focus should be on the freedom it gives employers, employees and customers, as well as on fixing and improving platforms rather than rejecting them outright. Another way to embrace technology would be for employers to augment their workers, rather than just replacing them. Much like workers in the Apple Store, who are all equipped with a smartphone or tablet, augmented employees can create a superior customer or user experience by bringing together the capabilities of computers and the personal touch of humans. Augmentation is actually a natural part of human development; technologies are first discovered, then shared and eventually embedded into tools to make them available to anyone. Few of us know much about code, but we have it embedded in our smartphones and use it to supplement our day-to-day lives, which is just a more advanced version of carrying around a box of matches instead of knowing how to start a fire. The world will continue to change, thanks to the development of new technologies. But what will either limit or liberate you is how you approach the new, and whether you’re willing to work with, rather than against, it. A good place to start is by no longer applying old regulations to new technologies. A lot of the conflict between regulators and technology companies comes from the fact that certain rules just don’t apply anymore. For example, the author once had to debate a lawyer for the Authors Guild, which was suing Google for scanning books into the nascent Google Book Search database. The lawyer argued that this was copyright infringement, but the author explained that the scans weren’t made to be published, but were actually a vital part of making a functioning search index. If they’d been stopped, the project wouldn’t have worked. Perhaps, like the rolling updates and community input of open-source technology, basic laws should be set, and the actual regulation to enforce them consistently updated depending on the changing circumstances of technology. But we shouldn’t just worry about how tech is policed; we should also ask why it’s developed in the first place. If developers have goals beyond monetary gain, then technology is almost guaranteed to serve humanity, rather than the other way around, because it’ll have been programmed to help people from the get-go. The major issue – as with the financial market – is that reactionary attitudes and short-term profits will inevitably lead to a dead end. The actual pioneers of the technology industry are those who look for something more than money. Those that follow are generally only after their own financial gain. Instead of this, you should strive to contribute more to industry and society than what’s in your pocket. Take the author’s own business, O’Reilly Media, which has taught and inspired many start-ups and budding billionaires. It doesn’t matter that the business has also made money – only that it’s improved the market by inspiring others. And what does this culture of sharing remind you of? The very nature of open-source software and platforms. It’s the sharing of knowledge and innovation that makes technology a force that serves us before it serves itself. And when that happens, you’ll only find yourself exclaiming “WTF?” in delight. The key message in this book: There is no doubt that technology is changing almost everything about the way we live, and there is little point in trying to stand in its way. But whether or not society has to suffer as a result is entirely up to us and how we approach it. As long as we are aware of the potential misuses of technology, and choose to embrace it as a tool for teaching and creativity, we can be sure to build the world of the future that works best for us. Actionable advice: Spot the seeds of the future. Rather than focus on the flavor of the month, look to the fringes of technology to try and imagine for yourself what will be the next big revolution. If you look for patterns, like the reimagining of open-source software as platforms, you can determine the most important trends, and pick out the next big thing. And if you’re in control of the future today, you can be sure that it develops with noble goals and an ethical mind-set. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

If Walmart were a country, its GDP would be greater than Norway’s. The company is the world’s largest commercial employer; and it manages just slightly fewer people than does the Chinese military. Yet how did Walmart, a company with hundreds of billions of dollars in profits each year, secure its market position and its success? These blinks put you ringside to watch the company’s stratospheric rise, explaining how an efficient and masterful combination of technology, management and strategy made Walmart what it is today. Yet you’ll see too that what goes up can come down – and that Walmart’s toughest challenges are ahead of it.   In these blinks, you’ll discover why during negotiations you should go canoeing with your enemy; how strawberry Pop-Tarts helped Florida cope with a hurricane; and why Walmart may in the near future either win big or fail miserably. How did Walmart become the largest retailer in the world? There are two core principles responsible for the company’s success: low prices and broad selection. Let’s start with price. Walmart’s pricing policy is famous in its own right. The company’s policy is called EDLP – Every Day Low Prices – and Walmart works hard to deliver on that promise. But how do they manage to do so? In a word, efficiency. Walmart is ruthless in taking every possible measure to cut its costs and lower its prices. Here’s just one example: In the early 1990s, deodorant was packaged in cardboard boxes. Walmart saw this as an unnecessary cost, as the extra packaging took up precious shelf space and wasted fuel in transport, making shipping more costly. So Walmart asked deodorant suppliers to sell their products without boxes. And as a result, the retailer saved 5 cents on every deodorant sold! Scale also plays an important role in Walmart’s commitment to low prices. Buying and selling higher volumes of goods allow the company to reduce prices. This may seem counterintuitive, in that we typically assume that selling a product at a lower price leads to lower profits. But that’s not necessarily true, as Walmart knows well. Let’s say you buy an item for 60 cents and sell it for $1, rather than $1.20. By pricing the item lower, you’ll sell three times as many items. So although you’re earning less per item, you earn more overall. It’s also worth noting that there’s another advantage to scale. In Walmart’s case, the larger it becomes, the more bargaining power it has with suppliers. Walmart has such market clout that suppliers simply can’t afford not to place their products on the retailer’s shelves. Thus, suppliers sell to Walmart at lower prices, which allows the retailer to pass on the savings to customers. Have you ever visited a Walmart store? You can’t help but be astounded by the enormity of the store itself, the endless aisles of goods. A typical Walmart Supercenter carries around 100,000 products in a 54,000 square-foot space. In other words, Walmart’s assortment of retail goods is without peer. This is especially astonishing if you consider that Walmart first got its start in mostly rural areas of the United States. The company opened its first store in the small town of Rogers, Arkansas. What sort of business strategy is that, opening in a rural outpost? Walmart management realized that rural, often low-income areas were neglected by other retail chains. Conventional corporate wisdom assumes that unless there are 50,000 potential consumers in a general area, a big store won’t turn a profit. Thus rural areas were left dependant on smaller, local retail stores that carried a limited range of products and closed on Sundays, to boot. But Walmart proved that a giant corporate-owned retailer could not only survive but thrive in rural areas. Walmart realized that customers would be willing to drive 70 miles or more to buy a significantly discounted lawn mower, for instance. By carrying a broad assortment of goods catering to every possible need, Walmart could reach customers who lived both near and far. Walmart also introduced its own private labels, such as Sam’s Choice, to sell alongside popular national brands. Private label products are essentially equivalent to well-known brands but are less expensive, as the costs of advertising and marketing are considerably reduced. It’s worth noting that although having a broad assortment of products benefits Walmart, there’s a drawback to having too much choice. That is, customers might get overwhelmed and consequently buy nothing at all. Sometimes less is more! For instance, when Walmart Canada removed two peanut butter brands from its shelves, sales of the remaining three brands rose. Another factor that makes Walmart successful is its approach in working with suppliers. Unlike many other retailers, Walmart doesn’t work with middlemen. This policy came at the urging of Walmart founder Sam Walton, who disdained distributors. Middlemen weren’t creating anything of value, he reasoned, but were simply getting paid to sell products produced by someone else. Walton rightly surmised that by bargaining directly with manufacturers, the retailer could save money. Thus Walmart developed its own supply chain capabilities and cultivated direct relationships with vendors. In the early days, however, this wasn’t easy. Walmart’s negotiations with suppliers were ruthless, with each party fighting tooth and nail to get the better deal. But this changed one day, as Walton was on a canoeing trip with friends. As it happened, the vice president of Procter & Gamble, a consumer goods manufacturer, had also been invited. Over the course of a friendly conversation, the two realized they had the same objective – that is, creating the best possible experience for the consumer – yet had different ways of achieving it. They also discussed the fact that Walmart and Procter & Gamble were operating with basically zero mutual trust and barebones communication. To change the situation for the better, the two managers created a Walmart/P&G team to improve communication and collaboration between their companies. These kinds of close supplier relationships eventually became the rule and not the exception for Walmart. Even though the retailer never fully abandoned its ruthless negotiation style, Walmart has expanded its relationships with suppliers, participating in product development, test marketing, package design and data sharing. Ultimately these collaborative relationships have led to increased efficiency and lower prices. For example, Walmart shares data on item-level sales with General Electric, so that the supplier knows exactly how many products to deliver and ship to Walmart every day. Walmart’s eventual logistics mastery started with a simple problem. Since its first stores were located in rural, isolated areas in the southern United States, many distributors found it unprofitable to deliver goods to Walmart stores. But Walmart made a virtue out of necessity: If no one wanted to deliver to its stores, the company would do it instead, setting up its own distribution centers, complete with a fleet of trucks. Today, the scale of Walmart’s logistics empire is unprecedented. It has more than 40 regional distribution centers, each over one million square feet. And each distribution center works around the clock to deliver goods to between 75 and 100 stores within a radius of 250 miles. What’s more, it takes some 85,000 employees to keep the entire logistics train moving along. You might wonder: how on earth can Walmart manage such an operation? Well, it all comes down to technology. Walmart from the start embraced state-of-the-art technology and supply chain innovations. In 2006, Walmart introduced the Remix project to improve merchandise flow and availability rates. In the past, Walmart had two different distribution networks: one for dry groceries, like cereal, and another for household merchandise, like paper towels. Both of these networks however included fast-selling items and slow-moving ones. Yet Walmart realized that the slow-moving products were gumming up the works, preventing other faster-selling products from getting to shelves quickly, possibly leading to losses in sales. So Walmart set up High Velocity Distribution Centers for fast-moving goods in any product category. When a store is aware that a product is running low, it sends data to the closest distribution center. Trucks are packed with the required goods and brought immediately to the Walmart shelf, with no time lost. Walmart’s focus on technological innovation has put it ahead of the competition, as it has made the retailer much more efficient, therefore enabling better service and lowering prices. The company’s technology tracks every single item in its stores. And when shelves run empty, a computer automatically alerts a warehouse that an order needs to be placed and shipped. Importantly, this system generates unparalleled amounts of data, enabling astounding real-time inventory visibility, data which has an immediate impact on merchandise planning. Here’s a fantastic example. When Hurricane Ivan was about to hit Florida, Walmart’s algorithms predicted there would be high demand for Kellogg’s Strawberry Pop-Tart toaster pastries. The retailer’s computers notified distribution centers and the products arrived in time to allow Florida families to stock up on Pop-Tarts before the storm. Yet the retailer doesn’t simply keep its data to itself to benefit, but openly shares some information with its suppliers. This way, suppliers not only know which products sell well but also can pull accurate information about which items sell well on which days and in which stores. This enables suppliers to plan their production more efficiently and better coordinate inventory levels with Walmart. With this sort of streamlining, Walmart can reduce not only waste but also the labor costs associated with storing inventory, which all translates to cheaper prices for the end customer. Tight relationships with loyal suppliers. An end-to-end logistics empire. State-of-the art technology. These are the reasons why Walmart is at the top of its game. But what’s ahead for the retailer? Read on to find out. Walmart may be the biggest retailer in the world, but the company is still far from reaching its full potential. There are still two large categories of potential customers to which Walmart hasn’t successfully reached out: residents in U.S. cities and international shoppers. As we mentioned earlier, Walmart got its start in rural, lower-income areas. To grow, Walmart needs to expand to urban centers, especially as there are many underserved urban areas that lack access to fresh, affordable groceries, for example. Since some 23 million consumers live in such areas, the strategy holds huge potential! And while Walmart plans to open 300 stores in urban areas by 2016, success is not guaranteed. As of today there is not a single Walmart in New York City. And it’s easy to see why: Walmart Supercenters are gigantic, and the real estate costs alone would be astronomical! There is a simple solution, however, which is to make the stores smaller. And that’s precisely why the company introduced Walmart Express in 2011. At just 15,000 square feet, these stores will still be able to offer three times the product selection of an ordinary grocer. The company is also taking seriously its global expansion plans. Walmart International is already active in 26 markets, making it the third-largest retailer in the world, behind Walmart U.S. and Carrefour. But there’s still more that the company could do to reach out to some 4 billion untapped global customers. The company’s long-term potential, especially in countries like China, India and Brazil, is huge. For now, Walmart International has entered such markets but doesn’t yet dominate them. In the future, however, Walmart International might surpass its U.S. counterpart as the biggest retailer in the world. How to reach out to new customers isn’t Walmart’s only challenge. A more serious challenge already looms: analysts expect Amazon to overtake Walmart as the world’s biggest retailer by 2024. There are two reasons why this is a possibility. First, Walmart has criminally neglected e-commerce. And second, Amazon is beating Walmart at its own game when it comes to price and assortment. Walmart’s online sales today hover near $6 billion, which is small when compared to Amazon’s $34 billion in annual sales. The question is, how could Walmart miss such an obvious source of revenue? In part, Walmart has focused its attention on expanding its Supercenters, which in general perform quite well. But there’s also another reason for Walmart ignoring the internet. A decade ago, when the retailer tried experimenting with online technologies, its core customers weren’t interested. In 2004, Walmart launched an online music store to compete with iTunes. However, since the typical, low-income Walmart shopper didn’t yet have internet access, the project was a flop. So Walmart has its reasons for coming late to the online game. But that’s not the only factor at play. The second reason Amazon may surpass Walmart is because it’s already surpassing the retailer at its core strengths, offering lower prices and a broader assortment of products. Consider this example: when Wells Fargo compared two baskets of goods in 2011 – one purchased at Walmart, the other on Amazon – the financial services company found that the basket from Amazon was nine percent cheaper, even when factoring in shipping costs. Another comparison found that when it comes to assortment, Walmart “only” offered 96 different types of camcorders, whereas Amazon offered 2,016. And this trend holds true more generally, in that the online retailer offers approximately 14 times more products than Walmart! In other words, Amazon is not only a fierce competitor but also a worthy foe. The key message in this book: If there’s a single secret to Walmart’s success, it’s that the company is ruthlessly efficient in all matters. Whether maintaining a broad mix of products, managing logistics, holding negotiations with suppliers or mastering state-of-the-art technology, efficiency is Walmart’s key organizing principle, all for the sake of offering customers the lowest prices possible.  Actionable advice: Be cheap! Walmart executives are frugal and have to follow certain rules to keep costs down. For instance, when a Walmart executive travels to meet a supplier to arrange a new purchase, the trip’s costs have to be one percent less than the money earned on the deal.

Kleinbard","summary":"Are you familiar with the view that many people just go through life and freeload on welfare programs paid for by the US government? Or that welfare is simply a synonym for all the paychecks handed out to the retired and unemployed? While these assumptions are quite widespread, popular beliefs, they are hardly based in reality; in fact, they are utterly false. With We Are Better Than This, the author invites readers to take a closer look at the current state of the US economy and fiscal policies, and how fundamental concepts like welfare have come to be greatly misunderstood by many people.  But the author does more than just point out all these errors and misunderstandings. Instead, he optimistically proposes change, not least by suggesting just how the US economy and fiscal policies can be improved, and in turn contribute to a more equal and happy society. In these blinks, you’ll discover why being poor makes it difficult to be happy; why taxes in the United States should be higher; and how the US economy has benefited from the Hoover Dam. What’s your first thought when you hear the word “welfare”? If you’re like most people, you probably think of government handouts to retirees, the unemployed and poor people who don’t usually deserve them. But however commonly held these beliefs are, they simple aren’t true.  The reason so many people have these incorrect associations is because welfare has been misunderstood. Welfare means investment in education, infrastructure and public goods – things that are essential to the functioning of any society.  Welfare also gives everyone an equal chance at happiness, but it can do so in different ways. For instance, government insurances, also known as entitlements, like Medicare, Medicaid and social security, are safety nets that protect citizens and enable them to take risks. This could mean starting a business or beginning a new career, decision that can in turn become highly profitable for society at large.  Another service welfare provides is education, which constitutes a fantastic way to promote the happiness of everyone in society by increasing economic mobility and production. Just imagine, would the tech mecca Silicon Valley exist without a strong education system? So welfare provides us with services and amenities that we all benefit from – but can’t we live happy lives without it? The answer is, not if you’re poor. Because being poor puts the pursuit of happiness out of reach, and when people don’t live well, society bears the costs.  For instance, in 2011, the Center for American Progress calculated the cost of hunger in America and found that the country lost $167.5 billion dollars to decreased productivity, more expensive health care and poor results in the education system.  But on an individual level, being poor also takes options off the table and makes survival one’s only priority. What’s more, poverty can actually affect how the brain works: the Save the Children Fund conducted a study that found that malnourishment during the first thousand days of a person’s life leads to irreversible cognitive impairment. So, welfare helps us attain happiness. But how does the United States currently score on overall happiness? Sadly, it’s right at the bottom of the class.  Why? Because the country is failing its middle class. The median family income in the United States dropped 6.3 percent from 2001 to 2010. In fact, after adjusting for inflation, the median income of an American man in 2010 was lower than what his father’s would have been 37 years earlier!  What are the consequences of plummeting incomes in the middle tier of society? The effect is that an increasing number of people are living below the relative poverty line, meaning they live on half the median income of the total population – and these people are poorer than ever. For example, in 2000, 11.3 percent of people lived under the relative poverty line, but by 2011 that number had reached 15 percent. In fact, in 2011, 1.6 million households, home to over 3.5 million children, survived on less than $2 a day per person.  As you might have guessed, this means society is not as equal as it used to be. In fact, according to the OECD, the United States has the highest rate of inequality with respect to disposable income, which refers to the amount of money people have left to spend after they pay taxes and social security.  But this inequality is a relatively recent phenomenon, and has increased rapidly since the 1970s. If you compare 1979 to 2007, you’ll see that everyone in society except for the top one percent came to hold a smaller share of the country’s total income.  Furthermore, Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, found that between 1993 and 2012, the incomes of the top one percent increased by 86.1 percent, while the remaining 99 percent only saw a 6.6 percent increase. In 2012 the top one percent accounted for half of all income in America, the highest percentage since 1917.  So, the United States got a bad grade, but what really counts is what the country does next. Like a promising third grader held back by a bad attitude, the United States will need to make changes in order to see improvements. If Americans keep up their current habits, it’s likely that their situation will become unchangeable.  In today’s world, it has become increasingly difficult to change one’s future. One measure of this difficulty is economic mobility, which refers to the ability to gain a better life than the one you were born into.  When comparing children in 1987 to their grown-up selves in 2007, those who were born in the upper 20 percent income bracket had a 41 percent chance of still being there in 2007. On the other hand, kids born into the bottom 20 percent only had an 11 percent chance of making it into the top 20 percent. Clearly, economic mobility is stunted.  In addition, contrary to the arguments of many, increased inequality has only had poor economic results. For instance, the people who benefit from an unequal society often insist that inequality drives economic growth, that it is a necessity of the free market and that low wages keep the costs of production down. If these assertions were accurate, we should be seeing stellar growth these days.  However, between 1982 and 2011, the United States’ per capita Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, grew by 69 percent. While that number sounds quite good, it’s actually the average rate of all OECD countries over the same period.  Compare that 69 percent to the GDP growth of countries with better social welfare like Sweden, where GDP grew by 71 percent, or Germany, where it grew by 66 percent despite the cost and chaos of German reunification. This trend has been clear during the first decade of the 21st century, and there is little to suggest it will change.  It’s clear that continuing on the current path is a risky proposition, putting both economic success and the happiness of society at stake. So where does the United States go from here? The options for change may seem limited; after all, isn’t the government already spending too much? Isn’t the colossal budget deficit an impossibly limiting factor? Well, the reality might actually be different from what we’ve been lead to believe.  Contrary to popular belief, fiscal deficit cannot be reined in solely by curbing government spending. For instance, the US government spends more money than anything else on insurance in the form of Medicare, Medicaid and social security.  Such programs, called entitlements, are mandated by federal law. So, even though such mandatory spending accounts for 60 percent of all government expenses, it cannot be cut under current laws. But in truth, this is no cause for alarm. Because despite what conservatives say, many government programs cover their own costs. For example, the Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or by its popular nickname ObamaCare, is actually deficit neutral.  What’s more, but the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, has shown a deficit decrease as a result of the ACA, which has revenue-increasing measures built into it. In fact, the deficit dropped from 10 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4 percent in 2013, and projections show it will drop to 2 percent of GDP in 2015.  Despite these facts, conservatives will continue to misguidedly push spending cuts because welfare is a vulnerable target. For instance, one surfer named Jason who lived off food stamps provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was a prime target of reporters. He wasn’t looking for a job and seemed happy “mooching” off society. The media used his case to exemplify welfare’s failure.  But Jason’s case by no means proves the failure of SNAP. In fact, 85 percent of the program’s recipients live under the poverty line. Therefore, even if one in 1,000 people benefiting from SNAP lived like Jason, it would still be an effective program. The Hoover Dam, built over 80 years ago, is one of the greatest public works projects in history. This monolithic structure supplies California and the Southwest with clean water that enables California to grow a huge percentage of the nation’s produce, and keeps the economic engine of Las Vegas running.  The dam is thus a prime example of how public investment acts as a foundation for private business. But what’s the state of American public investment today? Sadly, present-day government investments are far too low. In fact, the government hasn’t invested so little in public works since the end of World War II. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE, the total infrastructural investment necessary to get the United States back up to speed amounts to $3.6 trillion over the next eight years. Despite this projection, total government funding for such projects currently stands at just $2 trillion.  But it’s not just public works that are underfunded – the same is true for investment in education. As a result, the OECD has stated that the US education system is less effective than other countries at enabling students to reach their full potential. In general, public investments in essential infrastructure are key to a functioning society and national successes. Just think what the United States would be like without railroads, high-speed internet and highways. Imagine how difficult a simple trip to the store would be without a public road leading to your home!  But government investments don’t just turn the wheels of society, they’re also great for the economy.  How? One way is by getting people working, which leads to lower unemployment. Government investments also bring in higher tax revenue while stimulating increased household spending, effectively killing three birds with one stone! So, public works are key to the happiness and success of society, but how can we pay for them? In fact, there’s only one way the government can get serious sums of money from its citizens: taxes, which in the United States have gotten far too low.  According to a 2012 OECD study, the proportion of all taxes, including national, state and regional taxes, to GDP is lower in the United States than in any other OECD country. Even Switzerland, a notorious tax haven, has a higher proportion! Taxes in the United States are also lower than they have been in the past. For example, in 2000, the government had run a multiple-year surplus and the CBO projected an income from taxes of 20.4 percent of GDP. By contrast, in 2012, the total tax revenue collected by the government amounted to only 15.3 percent of GDP. Lower taxes mean that the country simply cannot afford a happy and prosperous society.  But the government also loses revenue to tax rebates. In fact, America’s substantial list of tax rebates are effectively a hidden form of government spending.  Tax rebates, or tax expenditures as they’re officially known, come in the form of subsidies for oil companies, renewable electricity, mortgage interest deductions and many other examples. For instance, personal itemized deductions, such as rebates for mortgages, charitable contributions and income taxes, cost the government $240 billion in 2013 alone.  These rebates for the most part go straight into the pockets of the country’s wealthiest people rather than staying in government coffers. In fact, the United States offers more rebates now than ever before. As a result, the country has lower total taxation and, therefore, lower revenue.  The Joint Committee on Taxation has shown that, in 1972, the country only offered 60 tax expenditures; compare that to 2013 when there were around 250, and the combined value of all tax expenditures totaled $1.2 trillion. That alone is more than the total amount raised in 2012 from taxes on individual incomes! Pretend that the national budget is your own. About 60 percent of it goes toward fixed costs like rent, utilities and insurance, but the rest you can spend as you wish on food and general maintenance. Now say you want to eat healthier and your house needs a new roof. Naturally, you’ll need to raise more money to cover these investments, and the same goes for the United States’ desired expenses.  But how can the country raise the money it needs? The answer is by returning taxes to their previous levels. In fact, the United States would only need to return to pre-2001 tax levels to cover its current spending and doing so would pose no threat to the economy.  For instance, in 2012 the CBO speculated on what returning to pre-2001 tax levels would do to the economy. According to their results, increased taxes might slow economic productivity in the short term, but the reduced deficit would have positive effects for long-term growth.  However, not every facet of the pre-2001 tax system was perfect. Some overly complicated aspects should certainly not be reinstated, but without them, there would be a $1.5 trillion hole to fill. Luckily there’s an easy way to patch it up: removing personal itemized deductions.  Removing these deductions would not only raise the $1.5 trillion needed, but it would also have several bonus effects. It would make the country’s tax system easier to understand, increase the transparency of the national budget and would also make taxes more progressive by asking for more money from rich people who can afford to pay it.  For example, most of the people who receive rebates in the form of mortgage interest reductions live in mini mansions, which suggests they don’t need additional subsidies to live comfortably. Shouldn’t their money be used to promote the happiness of society at large?  So, we can raise revenue without harming the economy. Now what should we do with this newly generated income? Imagine your personal budget again. What would you do with a little extra money? You’d probably buy something you’ve needed but haven’t been able to afford, something that makes your life better and brings you happiness. By the same logic, the government should spend its increased income on making society better and happier.  In fact, it’s easy to promote everyone’s happiness by investing in society, because a society’s happiness is simply the combined happiness of all its members. It’s also clear that because of growing inequality, a trend that risks becoming ever more deeply entrenched, millions of US citizens don’t lead happy lives. But we can change that by following the examples set by other powerful OECD economies, combining public and private investment to do better for all their citizens. Doing good for others in society can increase everyone’s happiness, since the people who have been helped can themselves contribute to growing the economy.  Remember, it’s not that the fundamentals of the US economy are broken; just over a decade ago the country boasted one of the healthiest economies in its history. But to get out of its current rut, it needs a more holistic approach to discussing the economy and fiscal policies.  The fact is that the United States must bring back taxation levels that let its citizens pay for the things they want and that make them happy, like a strong military and good social welfare. By raising taxes to fund investments, the country can become better for everyone. Investing in education, infrastructure and insurance will let Americans realize their full potential as individuals. And when everyone in a society reaches their full potential, they can all contribute to the growth of its economy. This, in turn, lays a foundation for future investment, while lending a helping hand to those in need. An investment in society is an investment in ourselves.  Although the last ten years have been difficult for Americans’ collective happiness, there is a better way to move forward. The key message in this book: The United States can build a better, happier and more productive society by redefining the way the country thinks about taxation and spending. It all depends on making everyone pay their fair share, investing in the things everyone needs and helping every individual realize their full potential.

Indeed, algorithms are everywhere. They guide our social media feeds and sift the advertisements we see. And they also influence human life in many other ways; often, they now dictate which jobs and schools we have access to. You might think that decisions – about hiring, about admissions – would be much fairer if based on objective calculations rather than on someone’s gut feeling. After all, algorithms judge everyone on the same scale, right? Well, as you’ll learn in these blinks, the situation is a bit more complex than that. You’ll also find out why manipulating Facebook feeds can improve voter turnout; how an algorithm used to rank US universities increased tuition by 500 percent; and why Florida drivers with flawless driving records pay higher premiums than drunk drivers.   In many ways, the internet helps democracy. It’s a public platform that supports independent voices. But that same platform is also open to powerful propaganda machines that can manipulate the conversation. Research has shown that social media and search engines are especially vulnerable to algorithms that can influence the decisions of unsuspecting users. Researchers Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson found proof of this after asking undecided voters in the United States and India to find information about a handful of different political candidates. The catch was that the voters were told to use a specific search engine, unaware that it had been programmed with an algorithm that favored one candidate over all the others. As a result, the participants showed a 20-percent shift toward voting for the algorithm's preferred choice. A similar study happened on Facebook just prior to the 2012 elections: Solomon Messing, of the Pew Research Center, designed a special algorithm that would generate the news feeds of two million users and favor political news over all other posts. Facebook surveyed the participants before and after the elections, and the results showed that 3 percent more users turned out to vote than was expected before the algorithm had been adjusted to favor politics. While we can’t know for sure whether certain search-engine or social-media algorithms are designed to influence users, it is clear that there is vast potential for abuse. It is also clear that political candidates are well aware of their power to garner votes. Heading into the 2012 elections, Obama had a team of data analysts who interviewed thousands of voters and used their answers, in addition to demographic and consumer data, to create mathematical profiles. These profiles were then used to find similar people on national databases. Based on the profiles, they could assume that people with similar interests and backgrounds would also share the same political views.  Once people with similar data were grouped together, the analysts could create algorithms that made sure these groups received specifics ads that would appeal to their tastes. So those who showed evidence of having environmental concerns, for instance, were targeted for ads that highlighted Obama’s environmental policies. Predicting future crimes sounds like something out of a Philip K. Dick science-fiction story, but it is, in fact, part of today’s reality. Police departments are using algorithms to target prospective criminals. But this software is far from perfect, and the algorithms have led to cities being unevenly policed and certain people being unfairly singled out. How has this happened? The algorithms rely on historical data to pinpoint where crimes are most likely to occur, and it’s the police who determine which data is fed into the algorithm. Part of the problem is that the police tend to focus on specific kinds of crimes, such as “nuisance crimes,” which include vagrancy and certain drug-related offenses. Given that crimes like these tend to occur in poor neighborhoods, the analysis will end up being completely skewed toward these parts of the city. As a result, the police send the majority of their patrol units to the streets of poor neighborhoods, making the residents feel unfairly targeted. This also leads to neglect of wealthier neighborhoods, which become more vulnerable to criminal activity. Similar built-in biases skew the data that police use to predict potential violent crimes as well, leading to innocent people getting labeled as dangerous. In 2009, the Chicago Police Department received a grant to develop new crime-prediction software. They used that money to develop an algorithm that came up with a list of the 400 people most likely to be involved in a homicide. One of those people was Robert McDaniel, a 22-year-old who became the focus of police attention. One day, in 2013, a police officer even visited McDaniel’s home to let him know that the police had their eyes on him. But McDaniel was never charged with any crime. He ended up being red-flagged by the algorithm solely based on the people he follows on social networks and the criminals who happen to live in his neighborhood. In short, growing up in a poor neighborhood is all it takes to get you labeled as potentially dangerous. To be fair, crime prediction algorithms are designed to protect people, but they can very easily make people’s lives worse than they were before. As we’ll see in the next blink, a similar problem is plaguing the insurance business. If you’re familiar with insurance agencies, you might be aware that they’ll ask different clients to pay different premiums. And, no, they don’t just do this at random. They use the specific data they’ve collected on their customers. For car insurance, algorithms are used to calculate payment amounts based on how many prior accidents a customer has been in as well as their prior credit reports. In fact, in some areas, those credit reports are given more weight than a customer’s driving record. Such is the case in Florida, where adults with clean driving records and poor credit reports end up paying an average of $1,552 more per year than drivers with excellent credit and a history of drunk driving. This leads to poor drivers with impeccable driving skills having to pay more for insurance than rich drivers. And so begins the vicious cycle: By being forced to pay more for insurance, cash-strapped families will be more likely to miss a payment on another bill and worsen their credit score even further. And then, when their current insurance expires, the rate on their next contract will go up even higher, even if they haven’t broken a single traffic rule. Some insurance companies are even using algorithms to calculate the likelihood that a customer will shop around for cheaper prices. The insurance company Allstate does this by using a model that employs consumer and demographic data. If the algorithm suggests that a customer is likely to search for lower prices, they’ll offer them a reduced price, sometimes as large as 90 percent off the average rate. However, if a customer isn’t likely to shop around, his rate can increase by as much as 800 percent. But what Allstate’s algorithm is really doing is taking advantage of poor people without formal education, since this is the demographic that is less likely to shop around for other options. It can be difficult to spot the best workers out of a pool of hundreds of applicants. So it makes sense to use a variety of tests, in combination with the help of data companies, to sort through the results. But these tests have proven to be restrictive for certain kinds of people, especially when it comes to personality tests, which have made it next to impossible for someone like Kyle Behm to get a job. Behm had to drop out of his classes at Vanderbilt University to get treatment for his bipolar disorder. But in 2012, he was healthy enough to start looking for a part-time job. So he applied to Kroger, a supermarket chain, after a friend told Behm that there was an open position. When he was turned down, he checked with his friend, who told him that he’d been “red-lighted” due to the results of his personality test: the algorithm had tagged Behm as “likely to underperform.” Unfortunately, the same thing happened to Behm at all the other minimum-wage jobs he applied for. So, with the help of his father, he filed a lawsuit against seven different companies under the Americans with Disabilities Act. As of 2016, the suit was still pending. Part of the problem is that the companies handling the data can make some troubling mistakes. When Catherine Taylor applied for a job with the Red Cross in Arkansas, she was rejected and told that it was due to her criminal charge for intent to manufacture and sell methamphetamine. This seemed odd to Catherine since she had a pretty clean record. When she investigated further, she found that those charges belonged to another Catherine Taylor who happened to have the same birthday. She also discovered that it was the company providing the data to the Red Cross that had made the mistake, which prompted her to do a little more research. In the end, Catherine discovered that at least ten data brokers had made the same mistake, linking her to a serious crime that she’d never committed. It’s no secret that colleges in the United States have gotten quite expensive over the past 30 years, but few people know that one of the main reasons for the increase in tuition is due to one newspaper. In the 1980s, US News and World Report began using an algorithm that ranked the quality of US colleges using data that they believed would determine their success, such as SAT scores and acceptance rates. Suddenly, these ranking became crucially important for all the universities involved, and they all set out to improve their performance in the areas that the US News algorithm used. But to do that, they needed resources. This scramble for money is largely responsible for tuition going through the roof. Between 1985 and 2013, the cost of higher education increased by 500 percent. These rankings weren’t the only factor that contributed to this increase, but they certainly encouraged the schools to raise their costs. One of the most damaging things US News did was to include acceptance rates in their formula, as it completely ruined the concept of a “safety school.” Traditionally, a safety school was a college that had a high acceptance rate, and would serve as a good backup plan for a student who was also applying to a more prestigious school like Harvard or Yale. But since US News gave schools with a lower acceptance rate a better position in the rankings, many schools began lowering their rates and sending out fewer acceptance letters. In order to keep their actual enrollment numbers the same, they had to choose which students they were going to reject. By looking at their numbers, the safety schools could see that only a small percentage of the top students would choose them over the prestigious schools, so they believed that rejecting them wouldn't do any harm. But even if only some of these high-performing students chose to attend, it would have benefitted the school. Also, the decision to reject high performers out of hand ruined the backup plans of many good students. Like all the other algorithms we looked at, what started out as a good idea ended up doing far more harm than good. The key message in this book: Algorithms were initially created to be neutral and fair by avoiding all-too-human biases and faulty logic. However, many of the algorithms used today, from the insurance market to the justice system, have incorporated the very prejudices and misconceptions of their designers. And since these algorithms operate on a massive scale, these biases lead to millions of unfair decisions.  Actionable advice: Write machine-friendly resumes.

In these blinks, you’ll discover why higher wages can harm your health if you live in America; how to make your country (appear) wealthier by using air conditioning; and how living in a social democracy is related to reading newspapers. While newspapers love to spin the sensational, there’s nothing that shocks and surprises better than first-hand experience. A case in point is Europe: there’s a big difference in the way the continent is portrayed in the media, and how things are on the ground. From The Wall Street Journal to the New York Times, US newspapers have warned readers of Europe’s “imminent” financial collapse for decades. Business columnists cite high unemployment rates, low wages and high labor costs as the telltale signs of the continent’s coming collapse. It seems that failing European nations are no match for a strong America and its impressive GDP. Even the country’s poor are thought to be living better lives than the poor in Europe. As a result, many Americans imagine that Europe is a gloomy place, filled with crumbling buildings and downtrodden citizens. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. The author discovered this personally while traveling through Zurich. Much to his surprise, this Swiss city’s buildings were beautiful, its streets pristine. Citizens were good-natured and content. It was an experience of Western Europe that you probably wouldn’t hear about in the pages of an American newspaper – except in the paper’s travel section. The New York Times travel section is filled with praise for European cities and the European lifestyle. From the warm beauty of Barcelona to Copenhagen’s vibrantly cool character, American travel columns paint a vivid picture of the true condition of the European economy – describing an aesthetic that American cities just can’t match. If you want to learn about the real state of Europe, don’t read the financial pages but turn to the travel section! But what about the American state of affairs? As you’ll see in the next blink, statistics on taxation and public benefits reveal much about the lifestyle gap between Europe and America. In general, European citizens pay higher taxes. Americans, on the other hand, can rest easy knowing that the government doesn’t want that large a share of their hard-earned income. But are higher taxes, in general, such a bad thing? For most Europeans, taxation has its benefits, as this money is essentially returned in the form of generous holiday time, well-paid maternity and paternity leave, reliable healthcare and free education. Europeans on average also work less than Americans. According to a 2007 OECD report, the average American works 1,804 hours per year while the average German works just 1,436 hours. Essentially, Europeans have more leisure time to enjoy all the benefits that taxes make possible. While Americans only pay four-fifths of the tax paid out by Europeans, the benefits they receive in return are few. A much smaller amount of tax returns to citizens as social benefits. Most of the money goes either to the private sector or the military. Of course, the United States sells a significant amount of weaponry to foreign countries. This should mean that the government earns enough to correct the imbalance between what American citizens pay out in taxes and what they receive in return. But things don’t quite add up that way. For example, Americans have it tough when it comes to issues such as retirement benefits. In 2004, the OECD found that the average public pension across the top 20 developed countries was 67 percent of an individual's working income. In the United States, however, this figure was only 39 percent Meanwhile, American’s taxes go to private industries such as insurers, pharmaceutical companies and private hospitals that profit from what should be a public good. And alarmingly though perhaps unsurprisingly, the lower middle class in America is steadily sliding into poverty. The number of children and elderly living below the poverty line is double that of Western European countries. According to the 2000 Luxembourg Income Study, 24.7 percent of elderly individuals in the United States were below the poverty line, compared to just 10.1 percent in Germany. For children, the numbers were 21.9 percent and 9 percent, respectively. This goes to show that taxation alone is no indicator of a nation’s health. How society benefits from the tax system is what counts. What’s life like for an average, middle-management European professional? Turns out it’s pretty good, starting with the worker’s commute to the office. European countries support far more effective and affordable public transportation systems than do US states. Because public transport works so well, European commuters are ten times more likely to use local transit to get to work than US commuters are. And rather than sitting in traffic every morning and suffering road rage as so many Americans do, Europeans get exercise during their commute. Many people live close enough to the office to ride a bicycle to work, which makes staying healthy a lot easier. In contrast, few Americans have the opportunity to ride a bike to work, as so many people live in the suburbs, far away from city-based offices. But why do Americans choose to live in the suburbs? Often the more money a professional earns, the bigger the house he or she wants to have. And the bigger the house, the further away from the city center it likely is. This results in not only longer commutes but also huge mortgages and high utility and gas bills. To maintain such a high-cost lifestyle, Americans need to work longer hours. They feel insecure in their jobs, worrying that any sign of laziness might lead them to miss a promotion or worse, be fired. Europeans, on the other hand, have clearly defined working hours and greater job security, which allows them to comfortably work a set amount of hours each week. On top of this, European professionals enjoy greater long-term benefits. While European pension rates have decreased slightly in recent years, Americans witnessed a sharp fall in the value of their 401(k) plans (an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan) amid the economic downturn. Many workers today fear that federally funded Social Security benefits too may not be available when they finally retire. What’s more, education in Europe is far more egalitarian. Young European undergraduates enjoy practically free tuition, while higher education in the United States comes at a notoriously prohibitive cost. While the United States has long been touted as the land of opportunity, this may not hold true for everyone. Taking a look at nothing but the numbers and it seems straightforward: The United States is statistically better off than other developed nations, especially those in Europe. But when you take a closer look at American GDP figures, for example, you’ll find that some factors bloat oft-cited prosperity statistics. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is a measurement that helps to demonstrate a level of economic health between countries. In 2006, GDP per capita in the United States was $44,155, while in Germany, it was $35,270. However, there are certain events specific to the United States that boost GDP in general, which can explain the perceived purchasing strength of the average American. Extreme weather is one such event. As more Americans move to southern states and temperatures in general continue to rise, an increase in energy consumption – whether oil, coal or otherwise – boosts America’s gross domestic product, and in turn, American GDP per capita. So of course Americans aren’t wealthier because they use tons of energy to run air conditioning units; but that’s the story such statistics tell, if you don’t know the details behind the numbers. Another statistic that is often cited is a country’s unemployment rate. This too can be misleading, particularly when comparing rates in the United States to European ones. According to a 2006 report by the International Labor Organization, unemployment rates for college graduates were 2.5 percent in the United States and 5.5 percent in Germany. These numbers, however, don’t tell the whole story: in the US, one out of every five workers with a bachelor’s degree works at a blue-collar job – a position below the worker’s qualification level – because of a lack of suitable employment opportunities. Taking this into account, the true unemployment rate of Americans with a bachelor’s degree at the time of the report was closer to 20 percent. In general, US college graduates also suffer from a greater debt load than do European students because of high tuition rates. Such statistics just don’t capture the dearth of jobs and crushing debt with which so many US graduates must grapple. So life in the United States seems harsh. But what are the alternatives? Let’s take a closer look at one particularly successful European nation. “Rhineland capitalism,” or social capitalism, has long been regarded as opposing the tenets of American capitalism. To understand what makes Germany’s social democratic system and economy different from others, let’s first compare Germany with another European country, France. When French workers are dissatisfied, powerful workers’ unions encourage members to take to the streets, often resulting in violence. Some actions have even led to employees imprisoning their bosses in the office when demands aren’t met. Germans, on the other hand, strike less frequently, and when they do, workers and owners handle disputes with a greater degree of professionalism and far less upheaval. Why is this the case? Germany’s government runs a “weak” state by design, and as part of government policy, there are few regulations put on private corporations. Thus disputes are more often than not settled within companies, in negotiations with union representatives and workers. This is just one aspect of Germany’s social democracy that is admired throughout Europe. In fact, within the European Union, Germany is a political leader in a much broader sense. Formerly divided by the Iron Curtain, Germany after 1989 reunified as a single nation – and in doing so, became the largest country in the emerging European Union, based on population. As the European Union struggles to manage cultural and economic tensions with former Eastern Bloc member states, EU bureaucrats are looking to Germany to help find that elusive balance between free-market capitalism and state-sponsored socialism. Many experts globally think of China as a leading industrial power. But in many ways, this power is in Germany’s hands. Since 2003, Germany has claimed the highest global export sales, occasionally tying with China, while America is in third place. And German workers have achieved this with six weeks of vacation time, don't forget! It should be noted that as of 2009, China was positioned to surpass Germany in export sales, but this was mostly because of the global recession and rise in the value of the euro. German companies in general don’t stress about how to beat unions or to compete with others on cost. Instead, they focus on offering high-end, high-value goods and engineering services. Demand for German products and services is and remains high because few other countries offer products and services at such a consistently high level of quality. German products now dominate the markets in which US companies once ruled. Thus the “German miracle” presents itself as a significant rival to American labor. Social democracy in Germany seems to be the winning policy for growth and prosperity. So where did it come from? The answer might surprise you. Many politicians in the United States sniff at Germany’s economic system, disdainful of its “socialist” roots. Yet the seeds of social democracy in Germany were planted by the Allies after World War II. At the end of the war, the people responsible for planning a sustainable economic future for the new West Germany were decidedly pro-labor. Many were either socialists from the British Labour Party or New Dealers, Americans who advocated liberal social ideas. Meanwhile, US Generals also welcomed the idea of workers having a say in how the country was rebuilt. This principle has remained at the core of German business practices, even today. German workers still have a seat at the negotiating table when important decisions are made by a company. It is this approach that makes German social democracy successful. Let’s take a closer look at how such social democratic organizations are structured. There are three major components: the works council, the co-determined board and regional wage-setting institutions. The works council is made up of on-location employees. Employers must consult the works council on issues such as shift assignments and layoffs before any decisions are made. The co-determined board, as the name suggests, is the company’s board of directors which is made up of members selected by both employees and shareholders. Employees elect half the board and these members have the same voting rights as directors. If there’s an impasse, the chairman, elected by shareholders, can cast the deciding vote. Regional wage-setting institutions are unions that negotiate for uniform wages and pensions in a given region. This means that workers who perform the same job within different companies can expect the same wages and retirement benefits. In this system, employees, shareholders and business leaders alike have a role to play and an equal voice to express concerns. This fair system has inspired trust between workers and management. So why isn’t a system like this implemented in companies and countries over the world? If workers want an equal voice in company decisions, they need to be informed about current affairs. Unfortunately, as you’ll discover in the next blink, this may not be the case everywhere. As media outlets go out of business in the United States, printed media continues to thrive in Europe, as any German train full of reading commuters will demonstrate. German citizens still consume a large percentage of daily news and current affairs from newspapers or magazines. Frankfurt, one of Europe’s major cities for business, is located just a few hours by train from other financial centers such as Berlin, Paris or Amsterdam. Many professionals travel between these cities daily, the perfect opportunity to read a newspaper cover to cover. And while many US tabloids are filled with sensational, bold headlines and colorful pictures, newspapers in Germany tend to be printed with lots of dense text and few images. Although statistics point to a drop in newspapers’ paid circulation numbers in Germany, new free newspapers are being introduced, showing that readership is still on the rise. In general, paid circulation numbers are still far higher in Germany than in the United States. While US newspapers claim a paid circulation of 34 million (considering a total population of over 300 million), Germany, with its much smaller population of 80 million, boasts a paid circulation of some 23 million. What explains the German love for printed media? Simple – keeping up with current events is just part of the culture. Compared to Americans, Germans constantly read to stay abreast of political and economic developments. While the manufacturing industry in the United States and Britain, for instance, has been declining over the years, the sector is still going strong in Germany, which is why political and social developments, such as union news or a sector’s gains or losses, can have an enormous impact on the workforce. To make the most of their deciding power, workers ensure they stay in the loop. A transparent, productive society depends on an engaged, informed population. Citizens who read and discuss articles, rather than gossip over tabloid revelations, support a thriving system. Of course, reading the news isn’t always pleasant. No doubt this was the case for German workers in the late 1990s, when the economy tanked. Find out more in the next blink. The German economy today is robust. But in the late 1990s, the picture was very different. At the time, the economy seemed close to collapse, with the reunification of East Germany and West Germany adding to the enormity of the crisis. The root of the problem went back to 1989, when some 4.5 million Germans were unemployed, the highest level of joblessness seen since the Weimar Republic. Because of a lack of jobs, many young Germans instead decided to live at home and pursue a higher education degree. But the students were deemed “too old” to hire once they eventually graduated, and companies brought on younger, educated British workers instead! This meant unemployment rates were still high even in the late 1990s. Supporting a large number of educated but jobless citizens, the German state felt the strain as it paid out millions in unemployment benefits. To add to the troubles, West Germans feared that reunification was making things worse. They felt that their taxes were only supporting East Germany’s failed economy, with no end in sight. If Germany faced the same challenges today, the state would have two options: to run a deficit or cut benefits. Yet at the time, the European common currency was just starting to be introduced. Running a deficit was prohibited within the currency bloc, which left cutting benefits as the only option. Despite the painful cuts, there were clear signs that German industry would survive and remain strong. Labor laws prevented companies from abandoning manufacturing for more lucrative returns in the banking or finance sectors. These limitations allowed Germany to not only recover but also thrive, thanks to its prosperous manufacturing industry. The introduction of the euro further benefited the German economy. German manufacturers no longer suffered from the German mark fluctuating against rival currencies such as the French franc or Italian lira. And all the while, thanks to Germany’s social democracy, crucial public goods, from healthcare to education, have remained affordable despite times of economic pressure. How did Germany secure these sectors? Because things such as healthcare and education are protected as public goods, that is, the state prevents private vendors from demanding exorbitant prices for them. The dark cloud of the 2007-2009 financial crisis still looms over North America, as the economy continues to struggle with enormous levels of debt. Like the United States, Germany holds a large external debt; yet the country is technically debt-free. How? Germany is a net creditor, meaning its external assets are large enough to balance out its external liabilities. How did Germany manage this? Basically, the country’s high-quality manufacturing exports were in demand even during the economic crisis. Today, creditor nations such as Germany, South Korea and China consistently outperform the United States in global markets. It’s also worth noting that Germany is not only in better shape than America to handle a future crisis – Germans are also more optimistic. The author spoke with young Germans living in Berlin, who have plenty of free time to relax and socialize in bars or cafes. The consensus was that American capitalism was “over.” The German system, on the other hand, had served them well and could be trusted to do so in the future. In an economic crisis, many American citizens face the harsh reality of losing their jobs and falling into poverty. German citizens enjoy a far more robust social safety net, from free movement of labor within the European Union to a well-funded pension system. Germany may even lead the next industrial revolution, according to the CEO of Siemens, a German multinational company. Green technology is just one arena in which Germany is leading the charge, as German companies manufacture much of the machinery used in renewable energy systems. In contrast, the United States can’t afford to invest in industry development until it manages to find a way out from under its crippling debt load. No country can claim to have a guaranteed secure and safe future. Yet Germany’s blueprint for success has served it well. Although European countries have taken a cue from Germany’s successes, across the Atlantic Ocean, America still seems reluctant. The key message in this book: Americans are constantly told that their economic and social system is the world’s best. But contrast the US economy with that of Germany, and that claim is thrown into question. Germany’s brand of social democracy has allowed it to lead the world in manufacturing, outperforming America in the global market while at the same time offering citizens a high quality of life.

Forests the size of Greece are chopped down every year. There are more shopping malls than high schools in America. What do all these incredibly depressing facts have in common? They all have to do with our almost insane rates of consumption. In fact, consumption has reached unprecedented levels. We’re buying, using and throwing out more stuff than any other time in the history of humanity, leading to the kinds of consequences listed above. Yet it can’t go on like this, and so a whole new paradigm is slowly taking shape. That’s what What’s Mine Is Yours is about: this new kind of economy by which we don’t just buy things, use them, and throw them out. We share them, save them, or pass them along. These blinks explain what collaborative consumption will look like, how it’ll change our current economy, and how it might just be the best way to save the world. In these blinks, you’ll learn why farmer’s markets are becoming so popular; how you can save $600 a month by car sharing; and why you ought to share that rusty old bush trimmer in your garage. Americans love to shop. So much so that, in the United States, there are now more shopping centers than there are high schools! Indeed, never before have we consumed so much, and the contrast with the past is astounding. In the past fifty years, Americans have consumed more goods and services than all previous generations combined. American families in the early 1990s had twice as many possessions as they did only 20 years prior. And since we have more possessions, we need more places to keep them. In the US alone, personal storage spaces comprise a combined area of 2.35 billion square feet. Just think: before 1964, personal storage facilities didn’t even exist. But why do we consume so much more today than we did in the past? The answer lies in several different forces that work together. For one, today’s marketing strategies are more sophisticated and pervasive. Advertisements are everywhere: the average person sees more than 1,000 advertisements every day. Moreover, today’s products aren’t built to last. Companies deliberately design products to fail after a certain time as a way to increase sales. General Electric was designing for “planned obsolescence” as early as 1932, when they deliberately shortened the lifespan of their light bulbs. Supermarkets are filled with incredible amounts of disposable products that can be used only once, like styrofoam cups and disposable razors. Finally, politicians and economists believe that consumption is the engine of economic growth. As a result, there’s a strong political incentive to motivate us to consume even more. For instance, to boost car sales during the recession in 2009, twelve EU countries decided to offer cash incentives to consumers who would trade in their old cars for new ones. In Germany, for example, customers that traded their old cars for more fuel-efficient models would get €2,500. But, as you will see, our record-breaking consumption has consequences. In 1955 the cover of Life magazine featured a photo of a family tossing disposables in the air entitled “Throwaway Living.” Indeed, disposable products are a huge part of our culture. As you’ll soon see, this has major implications for our society. Our enormous consumption is burning through the earth's resources at break-neck speeds. Since 1980, we've used up one third of our planet's remaining resources — ranging from fish to forests, metals and minerals. To visualize this, consider that in the tropics, deforestation destroys an area as large as all of Greece each year. In fact, we consume so much that, if everyone on earth lived like an average American child, we would need five earth-like planets to sustain our consumption during only one lifetime. All this consumption means that we produce vast amounts of plastic garbage – 100 million metric tons per year, in fact – that litters the oceans. And plastic waste doesn’t go away; it can only degrade into smaller pieces. Our penchant for disposable goods only exacerbates this problem, since we dispose of both the product and the packaging. As a result, the oceans are full of plastic garbage. In fact, each square meter of our ocean surfaces are littered with 46,000 pieces of plastic. Birds and fish mistake these plastic bits for food, leading some animals to die with bellies full of plastic. Sometimes this garbage accumulates, forming vast regions of devastation. For example, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean floats an enormous field of garbage, where marine life then indiscriminately eat the garbage, unaware that it isn’t food. An estimated 3.5 million tons of garbage span hundreds of thousands of square miles. This Great Pacific Garbage Patch isn’t an isolated incident. Some environmentalists say that up to 40 percent of the sea may already be littered with tiny pieces of plastic. Clearly, over-consumption leads to serious environmental consequences. But at least it’s making us happy, right? In 2008 a WalMart security guard was trampled to death by shoppers. Was this the result of a panic, in which shoppers were desperately trying to escape a fire or a bomb threat? No. They were trying to get in, not out. Why? Shoppers were anxious to take advantage of a new promotion — a plasma HDTV for just $789! Clearly, we place great weight on acquiring new possessions. But it comes at a cost: our own happiness. As a culture, we place a heavy emphasis on collecting material possessions, and many people rank shopping as being among our favorite activities. Our rituals, such as birthdays, holidays, weddings, etc., all feature wish-lists (where we wish for “a new TV,” not “world peace”). With our sights set on new material possessions, we sometimes become oblivious that we’re spending more than we can afford, which can result in serious debt. The average American household, for example, accumulates $8,000 in debt, and pays no less than $1,000 per year in interest and fees. In 2007, American consumers carried an average of $937 dollars per capita in credit card debt. The massive increase in consumption since the 1950s doesn’t just hurt our wallets. It also hurts our relationships, and coincides with a massive decrease in our happiness. As we’ve already mentioned, our consumption has been steadily increasing since the 1960s. But we’re no happier today than we were then. In fact, societal indicators signal that we’re faring much worse than before. Compared to 1960, three times as many teenagers commit suicide every day, and the prison population has quintupled. Since the 1980s psychological complaints, like depression and anxiety, have increased astonishingly, as has the rate of conditions like insomnia, obesity and heart disease. Clearly, our massive consumption harms both our environment and our personal well-being. But what is the alternative? The following blinks will investigate this question. After seeing the horrible side effects of our current system, we have to wonder whether there’s a better way to distribute goods. It turns out that there is! But before we get to that, let’s take a look at the changes happening in our economy. People are becoming increasingly aware that the premises of our consumption-oriented economy are false. Our economy struggles because we’re burning the candle at both ends: on one hand, its growth depends on continually increasing consumption, yet, on the other hand, our natural resources may dry up if we continue our current rate of consumption. Consequently, we’re beginning to search for ways to consume less and get more out of each purchase, doing things like repairing clothes and sharing cars and tools. What’s more, we’re starting to understand that consumerism impoverishes our relationships. As we increase our focus on material possessions as a source of happiness, we invest less time and energy into our personal relationships. Surely you know at least one person who works long hours to afford a nice home for his or her family only to discover that they don’t actually have the time to enjoy their company. These failing relationships can lead to isolation and even more consumption. Think, for instance, of those guilty dads who buy their kids extravagant birthday presents to make up for not being around. But we are learning, and are thus investing more care, time and effort into our consumption. For example, many people today find that they prefer the personal interactions found at places like flea markets or local farmers’ markets to the anonymous experience of shopping at a chain-store. In fact, farmer’s markets have become the fastest-growing part of the American food economy. Indeed, there are signs that we’re rethinking consumption. But there is yet another factor that is changing our consumption habits. The internet allows collaborative and democratic transactions which are inherently dynamic. The internet connects people from all corners of the globe, making it easy to communicate and do business with each other other. You’ll find more interest for your goods and services via online marketplaces than you could possibly find using traditional advertising, like classified ads or your local supermarket’s notice board. For example, if you live in a cottage in the forest and want to lease one of the rooms to tourists, you’ll discover that there aren’t many places to advertise in the forest. Online marketplaces like Airbnb, however, offer a platform to bring together hosts and vacationers all over the world. Because the internet connects so many people, it becomes easier to reach the critical mass necessary for new systems to function, such as collaborative consumption systems. These systems are comprised of a set of economic arrangements in which people share — rather than own — access to products or services. Collaborative consumption systems need a critical mass of items and participants to gain momentum. They simply can’t compete with conventional shopping systems unless they can supply the customer with enough choice. Imagine, for example, that you’re looking for a specific book. Likely, your chances for finding it are better in a larger marketplace than at a tiny flea market. Today, however, there are huge online platforms where you can swap, share or even sell books (as well as other items) without ever stepping foot in a store: i.e., peer-to-peer. In these kinds of online marketplaces, there’s no producer-seller-consumer divide. Instead, there is often a more personalized interaction, and the seller might also be a buyer, and vice versa. So what does the future look like for these collaborate systems. Our final blinks will look at different kinds of collaborative consumption systems. Lots of people love movies, but don’t want their homes to resemble a video store. They want to watch movies, but have no interest in buying and collecting them. Luckily, we have libraries and online video rental services who serve those customers in a way that gives them the film-watching experience without forcing them to ever own a film. Indeed, libraries were among the first product service systems (PSS) which shift the focus from owning goods to just using them. Product service systems are what enable participants to share or rent goods, like DVD rentals. As consumers share or rent objects instead of owning them, then our economy begins to shift from a consumption economy towards a service economy. In this system, it might be cool for people to share a luxury car rather than own one, for example. Using a PSS comes with a number of advantages: For starters, they’re better for the environment. With less need for ownership, fewer products need to be produced to meet demand. Just think: the average car sits idle for 23 hours a day. Imagine how much we could save in terms of resources if five people would share one car! Companies such as Zipcar see the wisdom there, and tapped into the car-sharing potential. What’s more, product service systems save you money, and give you access to goods you couldn’t otherwise afford. Looking back to cars, for example, it’s cheaper to share than to buy. Average British car users save around $600 per month when they make the switch to car sharing. Finally, if you have less stuff, then you need less space to store it. Without a car, there’s no need for such a large garage. By the same token, if you share lawn-care supplies, then you won’t have to clutter up your shed! Be honest: What do you do with unwanted presents? Remember the bread-maker your aunt gave you last Christmas? The only one who’s using it is the cat, and all he does is sleep on the packaging. Indeed, our homes are cluttered with valuable items that just sit around collecting dust. In Australia, for example, people spend $10.8 billion AUD per year for products that they never even use — not even once. The products themselves are fine, but they aren’t doing anything other than taking up space, collecting dust and possibly ending up in the trash. All the while, someone else yearns to own the things that you couldn’t care less about. Just imagine that something that you really want, like a treadmill or a blender, is rusting away in someone else’s basement even as you read this page! What if someone actually had good use for that bread-maker? Shouldn’t there be an easy way for them to take it off your hands? In redistribution markets, goods can be moved between owners — from those who don’t want a particular object to those who are eager to have it, either by simply giving it away, swapping or selling it. Just think of eBay or Freecycle, the “eco eBay.” Freecycle functions like an online charity store, only it’s open for everyone to participate. Anyone can offer and find almost anything on it, including things like half-used cans of paint. Since its launch in 2003, the site now has seven-million users! Redistribution markets often create win-win-win situations: for the happy new owner of a good, for the former owner who’s just glad to clear his garage of some clutter, and for the environment, since fewer goods means less garbage. If you live in a big city, then you probably don’t own a garden, despite wanting to grow your own vegetables, breed rare roses and be part of a community of passionate gardeners. While you might not be able to tend a garden on your own, you would be able to do so if you adopted a collaborative lifestyle. Such a lifestyle is the third kind of collaborative consumption system — one in which networks of people share intangible assets, such as office space, translations or other services, and even lend money. Collaborative lifestyle arrangements already exist. For instance, the website gardenswap.org facilitates collaboration by pairing those who have gardening space with others who’d like to garden. Eventually, once the crop is tended, it is shared among the participants. Like Garden Swap, most collaborative lifestyle systems operate on a local level, as it’s simply impractical to share a garden, workshop or workspace with people who live on another continent. Still, collaborative lifestyles are emerging on a global scale. For example, peer-to-peer traveling communities such as CouchSurfing and the aforementioned Airbnb work across borders, as do peer-to-peer social lending sites. One such lending service is Zopa, launched in 2005 in the UK. Zopa’s service is simple: it matches customers who offer to lend money to those who want to borrow it. Usually, interest rates are low and monthly payments are flexible. In addition, each loan is spread across several lenders in order to minimize risk, with the minimum loan amount set to £10. Collaborative lifestyles aren’t just about the goods; they’re also about community. While consumers may initially use collaborative lifestyle systems in order to find goods or services, e.g., a couch to crash on during a trip, they also find a new form of social bonds. Often, they meet like-minded people and even forge new friendships. In fact, an estimated 111,186 close friendships have been created through CouchSurfing alone! These kinds of systems can help us fight against the hyper-individualistic, resource-depleting side-effects of classic consumerism, and live better lives while we’re at it. The key message in this book: Our frantic consumption and “throwaway lifestyles” are wrecking our environment and impoverishing our relationships. Luckily, new economic relationships are emerging that promise to reduce our environmental footprint, curb our consumption and make us happier overall. Suggested further reading: Wikinomics by Don Tapscott & Anthony D. Williams Wikinomics shows how mass collaboration influences global as well as local economic and social structures, and examines how the new possibilities of the internet age have already changed the way businesses operate. In addition, the authors explain how companies and people in general can benefit from global collaboration, rather than feel threatened by its revolutionary character. Got feedback?

Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner","summary":"Why should we impose a tax on sex? How come the third chicken wing is sometimes more expensive than the first two? Economics comes into play in so many areas of life that it often goes totally unnoticed. Since authors Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner published the bestselling Freakonomics, they have continued to collect peculiar and strange economic and statistical facts. Some of these were published on their blog, where readers can send in economics-related oddities they’ve encountered themselves. These blinks, which present highlights from the authors’ anecdotes and insights, are a testament to the astonishing amount of nonsensical, strange and downright weird things in our world. In these blinks, you’ll find out why some names spread like wildfire; how driving a car is sometimes better for the environment than walking; and why we should fear the people we know more than we fear strangers. Every year millions of new parents fret over what to name their bundle of joy. But, personal preference aside, names aren’t all that important, right? Well, in the world of names, there are some strange statistics that indicate quite the opposite. For one, you should steer clear of people whose middle name is Wayne. How do we know this? One freakonomics reader, M. R. Stewart, has an unusual hobby. She collects newspaper clippings about crime. This is not too wacky in itself, but all the clippings feature perpetrators who have one thing in common: their middle name is Wayne. Author Stephen Dubner was shocked by the sheer number of clippings and strongly doubted whether anyone could assemble a list that long for any other middle name. As a result, he has now forbidden his daughters, even though they are currently only six years old, to date a boy with the middle name Wayne. Another strange thing about names is how they catch on. Even the unlikeliest of names can spread like wildfire. In 1999, there were eight children in the United States named Nevaeh. In 2005, this number rocketed to  4,457. What happened? The sudden name-craze originated in a single event: A 2000 MTV appearance by Christian rockstar Sonny Sandoval, of P.O.D, and his baby girl, Nevaeh, which is “Heaven” spelled backward. For baby girls, the name Nevaeh is now more popular than Sara. But the peculiarities don’t stop there; some names are uncannily fitting. Since the beginning of freakonomics.com, readers have shared some oddly apt names, like one Idaho man who was arrested for public masturbation after being spotted by a police officer in a public restroom. His surname? Limberhand. Another reader, who had recently moved away from San Francisco, related how sad he was to leave behind his dentist – Dr. Les Plack. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out the difference between something costing one dollar and something else costing 99 cents. And yet, paying one cent less somehow feels like a much better deal! When it comes to prices, all our common sense seems to fly right out the window. We really need to watch out for this, though, especially when it comes to our health, as some retailers charge wildly different prices for the same medications. Cyril Wolf, a Houston physician, told author Stephen Dubner that pharmacy chains like CVS, Eckerd and Walgreens sometimes put unreasonably high prices on generic drugs such as Ibuprofen. When Wolf investigated, he found something very odd indeed. Two chain stores, Costco and Sam's Club, sold the generic versions at a significantly lower price than the pharmacies mentioned above. For instance, a bottle of Prozac pills – $117 at Walgreens – cost $12 at Costco. Why on Earth, then, would anyone fill their prescription at Walgreens? Wolf says that retirees with prescriptions don’t compare prices at different stores, but simply assume that the price of generic drugs are consistent across all stores. So be sure to shop around! Hunting for deals is one thing. But there are also “deals” out there that are complete nonsense. Dropping by Harold’s Chicken Shack one day, author Steven Levitt picked up on something strange. The two-wing meal, which includes fries and cole slaw, was listed at $3.03, and the three-wing meal cost $4.50. This means that one additional wing cost $1.47. That’s more than the first two wings! We can sometimes be suckers for these “deals,” but Levitt reckons this bizarre pricing was simply due to the fact that many businesses don't understand pricing. If that wasn’t disappointing enough, it's not just consumers and businesses that are sometimes clueless when it comes to pricing; the U.S. government keeps the one cent piece in circulation, even though the cost of producing one cent by far exceeds its value. When the authors boldly stated in Superfreakonomics that driving drunk for a mile is far less dangerous than walking drunk for the same distance, people balked at the notion. But we’re worse at gauging risk than we think. For instance, we now know that horseback riding is more dangerous than riding a motorcycle. We all know motorcycling is pretty dangerous, so we wear helmets and other protective gear accordingly. However, one 1990 report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of severe injuries for every hour of horseback riding is more than the number of injuries for every hour of riding a motorcycle. A lot of the horse-related injuries involved alcohol, but this didn’t explain the statistic, because many of the motorcycle injuries did, too. Horseback riding is simply more dangerous than driving a motorcycle – a striking fact rarely mentioned by the media. As well as taking extra precautions around horses, we should be warier of the people we know – more so than of the strangers our parents taught us to fear. In 2008, church-goer Bruce Pardo put on a Santa costume and killed nine people, including his ex-wife and former in-laws during a Christmas gathering. Then there was the case of Atif Irfan, who was removed from an AirTran flight because his fellow passengers wrongly suspected him, a stranger, of being a terrorist. Their suspicions were unfounded. Together these cases support the findings that it’s the people we know whom we should be wariest of, as opposed to those we don’t know, like the people we sit next to on a plane. And there are more facts to support this. First, the number of murder victims in the US who knew their killers is about three times higher than those murdered by strangers; 64 percent of all rape victims know their aggressor; 61 percent of female victims of aggravated assault know their attacker; and one 2007 Slate article reported that of the 203,900 child abductions in one year, only 58,200 were perpetrated by strangers. What was the last lie you told? Perhaps it was an innocent white lie, just to save you or the other person some trouble. But sometimes we lie for strange reasons, and it often hurts us more than we think it will. People lie even when telling the truth would be beneficial. Data collected by César Martinelli and Susan W. Parker from the Mexican welfare program Oportunidades revealed some curious facts in this vein: A number of applicants, in order to appear less wealthy and therefore eligible for the program, didn’t report some of their assets. 83 percent stated they had no car when in fact they did, and 74 percent reported the same about satellite TV. This makes perfect sense, as possessing these things could hinder their eligibility for the program. But here’s where it takes an unexpected turn. A lot of the applicants actually overreported basic facilities: with 39 percent claiming to have a toilet, 32 percent saying they had tap water and 29 percent saying that they owned a gas stove, when they had none of these things. Martinelli and Parker put this down to embarrassment; the applicants, who are often poor, would rather risk not receiving welfare than admit they don’t own a toilet. Conversely, some lies do make sense when we can profit from them. Every year, a bestselling memoir like Margaret Seltzer’s Love and Consequences, is revealed to have been partially fabricated. So wouldn’t it make more sense to market such books as novels? Not really. If you’re an editor with a memoir in the works that you expect to be around 90 percent fact, it makes sense to publish it as a memoir. This is because alleged real-life stories generate more hype and media coverage and generally catch our attention more than novels do. It’s not surprising, then, that some memoirs are more fictional than fiction. Climate change is one of the most pressing issues we face today. But how do we address it, especially when we’re unwittingly worsening the situation by doing things we think will help? Driving, for example, is sometimes far less harmful to the environment than we think. Renowned environmentalist Chris Goodall calculated that if you walk 1.5 miles, and then replenish the calories lost from your walk with a glass of milk, the impact you have on the environment would be the same as if you drove 1.5 miles in your car and opted out of that cup of milk. But why? Well, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions it takes to produce that glass of milk roughly equals the emissions of a car driven 1.5 miles. There’s the carbon dioxide emitted from the milk-delivery trucks, and the gases emitted from the cows themselves, and in the end it’s more environmentally friendly if a few people carpool and go without their respective glasses of milk. Aside from misunderstandings about our driving habits, we also tend to believe that growing our own food helps the environment more than, say, eating less meat. Having your own veggie patch has become quite a trend in the US; it gets you in touch with nature and teaches you how to care for plants. We think, “Great! No need for a delivery truck for my dinner!” But is it really the best way to preserve the environment? According to Christoph L. Weber and H. Scott Matthews of Carnegie Mellon, 83 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from food production; a mere 11 percent of emissions come from transporting food. What actually would help would be choosing vegetables over meat products just one day per week, as meat requires a far greater amount of energy to produce. This would lessen the impact of greenhouse gas emissions more than your veggie patch! What’s the best day to rob a bank? According to one very successful New Jersey bank robber, the answer is Thursday. But that's not the only weird (and perhaps unsettling) piece of advice in the world of crime. Something a little more helpful to know is that criminals should never be reminded that they’re criminals. Priming is a psychological phenomenon that psychologists use to describe the unconscious influence of stimuli on our behavior, and its effects are demonstrated by the following study: A group of researchers conducted an experiment where prisoners had to flip coins and then report how many “heads” they had gotten. But before flipping the coins, half the group were asked the question, “What were you convicted for?” They were thus primed with the idea of criminality. The other half were asked the more neutral question, “How many hours per week do you watch television?” By being reminded of their convictions, the first group lied and said they got heads more often than the group who were asked about television. In fact, they reported they got heads six percent more frequently than the other group. But we can use this knowledge for good; correctional facilities could actually employ such priming methods in a positive way with criminals. Here’s another surprising fact about crime: The best way to catch a criminal immigrating to the US is to ask them if they're a criminal. And we already do this by using a form. Anyone wanting to become a US citizen must fill out the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s Form N-400. This form includes the question “Have you ever committed a crime for which you were not arrested?” It might sound crazy to include this question – after all, who would admit to it? – but there’s a good reason behind it. If US law enforcement can prove that an answer is false, it can be used to prosecute or deport the person in question. Do you think you should be having more sex? Well, we needn’t get that personal, but you might be surprised to know that how often you have sex may contribute to the common good, and furthermore, it could be connected to economics. It’s actually true that some of us should have more sex – but not for the reasons you might think! In More Sex is Safer Sex, University of Rochester economics professor Steven Landsburg posits that careful, STD-free people should be urged to have more casual sex. It makes sense for the common good for healthy people to do so, as opposed to reckless people, who are more likely to contract and spread STDs. Careless people should be discouraged from having sex, because every time they do they increase the chances of infecting all those who become sexually involved with them. Landsburg compares this to pollution. Most of us think it’s a good idea for factories that pollute to sacrifice something, like their profits, for the common good. So why should sex be different? A tax on sex would also make sense. Considering how much we spend annually on healthcare associated with sex – think unwanted pregnancies and STDs; considering the lost productivity that sex represents; and considering how strapped for cash the government is, it’s clear that we should set up a sex tax. Those who engage in sexual activity that spreads disease and costs society money would be highly taxed; practitioners of safe sex might get a tax break. For example, committed couples having sanctioned sex could perhaps receive a tax credit. Some of the authors’ suggestions on what to call such a tax include “Extracurricular Intercourse and Lesser Sex Act Tax,” or the “Family Creation Tax!” But this idea is not totally new. In 1971, Democratic legislator Bernard Gladstone proposed such a tax, claiming it would be “the one tax that would probably be overpaid.” Unfortunately it was deemed to be in poor taste and was consequently rejected. If you’re a freakonomist, you see the economy all around you. You also might know that money and economic trends affect us in ways contrary to what we’ve traditionally been taught. For example, we’re told to avoid bribery. But bribery is sometimes surprisingly useful – especially with our children and their schoolwork. Motivating people with money is rarely questioned. Without the promise of a paycheck, who would show up at McDonald’s every day to flip burgers? But when it comes to school children, we’re usually averse to monetary incentives. So, with a few colleagues, author Stephen Dubner conducted some experiments to determine whether financial incentives could improve students’ efforts in school. Right before they took a test, some students were offered twenty dollars to improve their score and another group of students weren’t given anything. Giving the money to the first group prior to the test made the incentive stronger because it was so close to the encouraged action. The students who were given the cash bribe were told that they had to give it back if they didn’t improve their results. As a result, it was the bribed students who performed better than students who entered the test empty-handed. Finally, patterns in consumption are often not what we think they are. For example, why did shrimp consumption triple in the US between 1980 and 2005? It depends on who you ask. Psychologists will often focus on fluctuations in customer demand caused by people becoming health-conscious or the effect of new advertising for shrimp. Economists, though, would probably look at changes in supply. For example, how better nets improve product availability for suppliers and reduce the final price. But microeconomics students – or anyone new to economics – would probably view the situation more like the psychologists than the economists. This is because the majority of us have more experience as consumers than producers, so we concentrate on customer demand. It’s only when you’re a full-fledged economist that you start to see economy in everything around you. The key message in this book: Economics can be found in the most remarkable places and examining the economy sheds some light on the motivations behind our thoughts, emotions and actions. Suggested further reading: Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner Freakonomics applies rational economic analysis to everyday situations, from online dating to buying a house. The book reveals why the way we make decisions is often irrational, why conventional wisdom is frequently wrong, and how and why we are incentivized to do what we do. Got feedback?

Perhaps you might point to an Excel spreadsheet, or a banking statement on your desk, and say: yes, that is information. But really, isn’t that banking statement just a piece of paper with some markings made in ink? What really gives it meaning? And what is information, then, if it has no inherent meaning? In these blinks you’ll delve into the substance of information, how it acts in the world and how we through our knowledge give it meaning and spread it through networks of people and products across the globe.  It all starts with an atom, and as you’ll see, grows to encompass everything you think you know – or might want to know – in the known universe.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why the Earth is a hot-bed of ever-growing information; what a tree and a computer have in common; and  how networking keeps rich countries rich and poor countries poor. What comes to mind when you think of the date, September 11? Whether it’s your birthday, the day a terrorist attack occurred in New York City or of an upcoming exam, your mind automatically attaches meaning to the date. But is there anything about this date that is inherently tied to any of those events? No, of course not. In reality, “September 11” itself is no more than meaningless information.  But what do we mean when we talk about “information?” Information is physical order. While we often think of information as something immaterial, like data, in reality information is physical. Sure, virtual information does exist but it’s always wrapped in a physical body, like a brain or a hard drive.  So at its core, information is simply the physical arrangement of atoms.  DNA, for example, is pure information. It is a physical arrangement of atoms used to build new physical orders, like a human body.  Information, and thus the physical arrangement of atoms, exists everywhere. It’s not limited to the DNA in our bodies but it’s also found in products – in everything from toys to smartphones – which are essentially configured arrangements of atoms.  It’s important not to confuse information with meaning. No matter what kind of information you’re dealing with, whether a strand of DNA or your bedside lamp, the information itself is utterly meaningless. But that doesn’t stop us from trying to make sense of it.  As a matter of course, we attach meaning, derived from context and prior knowledge, to meaningless information.  To help conceptualize this, think about the letters that appear on your computer screen when you strike a key on your keyboard. The letters themselves are simply a configuration of light on your screen – they have no meaning in and of themselves.  However, your understanding of the alphabet gives these letters meaning, thus turning raw information into words and sentences. What is the universe made of? Fundamentally, the universe is comprised of matter, energy and information.  But there is something else going on that is inherent to the universe: a constant battle between chaos and order. Information, or a specific ordering of atoms, is exceedingly rare. In fact, you’re far more likely to find disorder in the universe than order. To illustrate this, imagine that you own a Bugatti sports car. There is only one basic configuration of atoms that can produce the Bugatti that you purchased at your car dealership. If you unfortunately wreck your car, then the car will become yet another version of your Bugatti, one in which the physical order of the original product has been destroyed. Perhaps you smashed the windshield; maybe the car just has a flat tire. There are many ways in which the information from your newly purchased Bugatti can be lost. In fact, there are many more ways to create disorder than to create order. Consider the colorful Rubik’s cube, for example. The cube has only one solved state, in which each of the cube’s six sides is a single, solid color. But the cube has more than 43 quintillion possible unsolved states! Bearing all this in mind, one could say entropy – or disorder, the opposite of information – is the natural state of the universe.  To illustrate this, let’s light up a cigarette. As you smoke, the cigarette will burn, turning into smoke that will then dissolve into the air. All the information that once made up your cigarette will be lost. This idea that the universe tends toward entropy was first put forward by nineteenth-century Austrian scientist Ludwig Boltzmann, one of the foremost scientific minds of his era and a major contributor to the study of atoms.  However, Boltzmann was baffled by the findings of some of his own research. It appeared that information on earth was growing – order, not chaos, was ascendant on our planet. But how could this be?  So we’ve learned that our universe in general tends toward entropy. The planet Earth, however, is unique in that it is rich with information – order here is more dominant than entropy.  But why exactly would this be the case? Earth is different from other planets in the solar system because of its abundance of information; that is, the ordered, physical arrangements of atoms found here. This abundance is possibly due to the earth’s mild temperatures. Mild temperatures essentially allow for the existence of solid matter, such as flora and fauna. Solid forms are useful, in that a physical shell or body can protect the information “inside” from falling back into entropy or a disordered state. For example, your genetic information, or DNA, is found in your cells. Being self-contained, “solid” units, cells essentially house your DNA to keep it from dissipating. Without cells, your DNA could have never made you! Information isn’t just abundant here on earth; it’s actually growing in quantity. The reason why this is the case also has to do with the properties of solids. Solids are able to compute – that is, process and understand – information and take action according to the information provided.  For example, a tree (solid matter) is basically a computer powered by sunlight. It reacts to the amount of sunshine, behaving differently in summer than in winter. It “knows” when to sprout leaves, when to let them fall, and can direct its roots toward water to ensure its survival. Humans, unsurprisingly, can also compute. We have an understanding of our environment that is sufficient enough to act on the information we find within it. It is through this computational process that we can take something, like a tree, and turn it into something else, like a chair. Humans are unique in that we accumulate information. We do this by creating products, essentially changing the arrangement of atoms to improve our knowledge of the world. The products we create and use everyday embody information; some grant us immediate practical knowledge. For example, if you buy a smartphone, you accumulate both the practical knowledge of how to use the device to access information from the internet and make calls, and at least the partial knowledge of how the device was made and what it’s made of.  Such information-accumulating products differentiate us from our ancestors, for example. While society has made leaps and bounds, developing new ways to organize how we live and think, there is no question that the products we make – the physical order we create – is far more advanced than it used to be.  Thus we have computers, smartphones and airplanes instead of blunt rocks and bare feet; we have skyscrapers and solid homes instead of thatch-roofed huts that can be destroyed by even the most moderate storms.  What makes humans so special is our ability to “crystallize” information, to create something from seemingly nothing but our imagination. A computer or a robotic leg are things that don’t appear in nature, but had to be imagined before they could be created.  But crystallizing takes a lot of effort. When we want to create a new physical order, we need to push the limits of reality, and this can rarely be achieved by one lone individual. Thus people work together to develop new products with the knowledge they’ve collectively acquired from older products made by other humans. A robotic leg, for example, might come about through advances made in programming and engineering by previous generations.  This leads us to an interesting question: How can we really accumulate data, if each individual is limited in how much information he or she can gather? You’ve probably been here before: you’ve a tough exam coming up, and you study for days on end until it feels as if your brain is about to explode.  But why do we feel so overwhelmed after trying to cram our brains full of information? In essence, it’s because we can only remember and understand a limited amount of knowledge. To illustrate this, think of our economy – the sum of all our interactions as a society – as a computer; each person within the economy is a personbyte.  Each personbyte can, over time and with effort, accumulate a limited amount of knowledge and know-how. Knowing everything is simply impossible. Some of a person’s capacity for learning is genetic or hard-wired, meaning some people can learn better or faster than others. But still, every personbyte can bring roughly the same amount of data volume to the “computer.” However, the information isn’t disconnected. The economy essentially links the knowledge of many individuals together in networks. If every person sought to know everything on her own, development would cease or at best be excruciatingly slow.  Just think, if the author of these blinks had to reinvent a computer just to write these summaries, you certainly wouldn’t be reading this right now! Instead, the economy provides each person with the knowledge and information that other people have already have created. When a computer is created, it is made up of the accumulated knowledge of many individual personbytes. One personbyte will know how to produce a motherboard; another will be able to assemble all the different parts, and so on. But does this mean that the same knowledge is distributed to everyone, everywhere, equally? Unfortunately, no. Some places are more developed than others due to superior data access. Often places that have a more robust or accessible networks of knowledge tend to be more developed. Building a network takes a lot of effort. But in recent decades, networks have grown considerably and have established links worldwide. So why is networking easier today than it was in the past? This is due primarily to the existence of global languages. Whereas in the past people spoke many different local languages, today global languages like English, Spanish, French or Chinese allow people to efficiently communicate, often without the need for a translator.  This newfound ease of communication has allowed people to build better networks and make knowledge comprehensive for and available to nearly everyone.  But it takes more than a global language to build an efficient network. There is also a social and cultural aspect to networks that shouldn’t be neglected. For instance, if you live in a culture in which the family is the primary social unit, your bonds within your family will be stronger compared to your bonds with society at large. Your networks will be dominated by family-based knowledge and products, simply because this is what you trust. Yet in some countries, especially in Western nations, trust between the individual and society is quite strong. Here, individuals build networks based on trust outside of the nuclear family, the result of which is larger networks in general.  Bigger networks allow for more personbytes, and consequently such societies are generally more prosperous and more technologically sophisticated.  To show how important networks are for growth, look at the expansive networks used by large companies. The products produced by Apple or Google, for instance, are actually a collection of other products that network efficiently, produced by different firms. If you buy an Apple computer, you’ll notice that not all the computer’s parts are made by Apple itself but by other companies, each specializing in improving their own knowledge. Apple then uses its knowledge, via its network, to build its products in a way that makes them its own. Have you ever wondered why some countries become wealthy while others seem to wallow in poverty? How can we have on one side the super-rich, benefiting from the latest technology and living well, while on the other side the poor make do with substandard living conditions. In part, this has to do with networks. There are a few geopolitical centers, such as the United States and Europe, that maintain a massive amount of knowledge and personbytes. The products that emerge from these centers are increasingly complex; and because of the demand for such products, these regions can export their goods to other countries, accumulating wealth over time. Meanwhile, other countries, while they may show signs of slow to moderate growth, still remain poor and underdeveloped.  So why don’t these countries simply create larger networks of personbytes to advance their knowledge and wealth? Well, basically personbytes are attracted to existing networks. If they can, they’d rather enter an existing network than build one from scratch. Take Silicon Valley, for example. Here you’ll find a massive accumulation of personbytes, full of individual knowledge and crystals of information. And every day, more personbytes and companies move there to be part of this dynamic network. So this is why richer countries seem to get richer while poorer countries stay poor.  In many Western countries, you can find existing social structures and economies that allow newcomers to enter a network without too much hassle. For example, established academic institutions as well as strong banking networks make it easy for individuals and companies to join a network.  In many countries, however, it’s simply too hard to join networks and share information. The key message in this book: Information is something that is both misunderstood and crucial for all aspects of life – from a society’s economic growth to the existence of life itself. It is locked in a constant battle with its nemesis, entropy, to secure its continued existence.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Williams","summary":"The term “Wikinomics” describes the mix of technology, demographics and global economics that makes mass collaboration possible. Although the complexity of mass collaboration might seem overwhelming to some, it is actually a beneficial business and social strategy if implemented correctly. Not only can mass collaboration drive the innovation that helps businesses grow, but it can also serve as a catalyst to change the very way that society functions. In fact, mass collaboration is the engine of the new economy, and can therefore be a powerful weapon for those who can understand and wield it, and a nail in the coffin for those who can’t. Truth is, the future of business as a whole depends on how companies adapt to the “Wikinomics.” As consumers continue to demand higher quality products, they also want to be more and more involved in the creation of those products. Employees too expect to have a certain freedom and autonomy. These changes demand the attention of business and a reaction that generates new strategies to manage their goods, workforce and property. In these blinks we learn how to effectively harness the power of mass collaborations by looking at positive examples of the way in which open collaboration can increase a product’s value and thus turn any company into a successful, innovative one. In addition, these blinks will show you: How to turn your competitors into collaborators by sharing your information. How one business made heaps of money from the dust collecting on their shelves. Why one company pays their employees to do whatever they want. And why centralized production has gone the way of the dinosaur. Within the last 25 years, the internet has become a significant part of the lives of more than one third of the global population, and enabled us to communicate and cooperate with people all around the world on a massive scale. In fact, this easy access to information technologies is one of the primary tools for active participation in numerous areas of life traditionally reserved for certain elites, such as scientists or academics. Wikipedia is the perfect example of this concept in action: In the past, only scientists were responsible for assembling the world’s knowledge into tomes and volumes, whereas today anyone can go online and co-create the content of the world’s largest encyclopedia. In fact, even traditionally secretive endeavors, such as gold mining, can be turned into an open, collective activity. For example, in 2000 Goldcorp Inc. published all of its data for a certain property online and ran a contest to produce the closest estimation for the location of the gold seam. As geologists, consultants and students from around the world started submitting their estimations, the company gained valuable information that enabled them to locate twice as many mining targets as they had previously found on their own. As the internet continues to evolve, mass collaboration becomes an even more key feature. Indeed, when the internet was first conceptualized, it was thought of as a “digital newspaper,” but today it functions more like a “shared canvas” where each user can leave their own mark. Even a simple act like sharing a photo on Facebook has an impact on the online environment by adding to the content of the web. Consequently, most companies try to make their websites interactive, and treat their customers like co-creators instead of mere observers. As we can see, collaboration today involves the self-organized participation of many individuals, much like a swarm of bees. The interplay between these individual actors sounds complicated, so in the next blink we’ll derive some sense from this seeming chaos. So what actually makes collaborative efforts successful? For starters, both sides of a collaboration must be open to each other. This means having a willingness to let external talents contribute, thereby making collaborations possible. One great example of this is Linden Labs’ game Second Life, which is totally unscripted and allows users to create every aspect of the game from scratch. Secondly, there’s peering – a method of production that utilizes flat hierarchies and self-organization where individuals voluntarily contribute to the work as a whole. Peering aids mass collaboration by increasing a product’s value and motivating interested individuals to volunteer their labor and join in the effort. The leading example of peer production in action is Wikipedia, aka the “encyclopedia that anyone can edit.” Wikipedia relies completely on the passion of its contributors. In addition, there is no traditional business hierarchy; instead, the quality of the submissions is regulated by the self-correction of the community. Next, sharing, or providing others with access to your information and resources, allows individual members of mass collaborations to further their own inventions and allow for thriving innovations. One example of this is the way that people on a Skype-call or gtalk share computing power as a resource, thereby making face-to-face communication over the internet possible. Needless to say, both parties benefit from sharing. Finally, today’s open markets make collaboration possible on a massive scale never before seen. This requires all participants in a collaboration to act globally, meaning that they coordinate their staff and strategies in a way that promotes a unified whole instead of slicing the production into many local branches that are essentially duplicates of one another. An example of a company failing to act globally was General Motors, which at one point was employing the same staff positions in each local division of their corporation. This turned out to be an unnecessary expense, as a single person could have performed the same duties across the globe. Now that you have a firm understanding of what constitutes mass collaboration, the following blinks will explore what these principles will mean for the future of already-established companies. Companies that don’t adequately adopt the principles of mass collaboration will ultimately be left in the dust; they simply won’t be able to produce enough value quickly enough, and would also lose the interest of the consumer. In fact, today’s open markets offer more opportunities to customers and – the flip side – more competition for companies. This is because mass collaboration helps companies not only to better develop their products, but also to better market them to their customers. In addition, the low production costs of emerging forces like China and India, who offer quality services and products for only a fraction of prices found in the West, makes it unlikely that companies that don’t incorporate global collaboration could survive the competition. Furthermore, by collaborating actively and on a massive scale, a company can better hope to produce enough novel innovations to remain competitive. However, it’s not the large pool of participants, and therefore the larger number of ideas, that lead mass collaborations to produce innovations; rather, they produce innovations because their contributors themselves are motivated and diverse, which makes it easier to match talents with certain tasks. Moreover, mass collaborations, especially those that employ peer production, often use “general public licenses,” which give others the opportunity to contribute to the project and ultimately results in faster progress. Even the software giant IBM employed this strategy and adopted the open source software approach when their company faced a crisis, and learned to involve external programmers in their collaborations rather than offering ready-made but conventional products. With all these benefits in mind, mass collaborations readily become a “must” for companies who want to be market leaders, but mass collaboration also carries an element of risk – if you’re not careful. Although mass collaboration is an overwhelmingly beneficial strategy, it also involves certain risks. For example, finding the right ideas and implementing them consumes a lot of time, energy, and resources, and in some cases turn out to be very expensive. This is especially true in underdeveloped idea markets, where finding the right partners for a collaboration can be tough. Even worse, if you are especially unlucky, competitors can swoop in and take advantage of the same ideas you want to exploit before you have a chance to get them off the ground. In addition, if you want to use someone else’s idea that’s not already part of your collaboration, then you must often offer them a “bargaining chip,” i.e., monetary compensation and/or other incentives. This is especially difficult for start-ups or small businesses, who might lack the resources to “ante up.” Mass collaboration also comes with the constant, hidden risk of losing control over your own product. When you give others the right to co-develop, then value moves from the component products to the new invention made from those products. This means that the companies must constantly be aware of how their product is being used and developed in order to stay innovative. You can see this protective attitude in the music industry, where music labels still treat mash-up artists like criminals rather than collaborators, and refuse to allow them to freely remix copyrighted music. Finally, when collaborating with external partners, you simply can’t assume that they’ll have the same amount of credibility and work ethics as you do. Since mass collaborations are often peer productions, a company can’t count on the same work ethics as they’d enjoy in-house; their contributors simply can’t and won’t deliver the same kind of work as an employee. The risks associated with mass collaboration clearly make it something that companies can’t dive into head first. They must first develop a strategy for implementing these new possibilities within their existing business model. The following blinks will explore exactly how companies can reap the benefits of mass collaboration. While the protection of intellectual property is part of the foundation of monetary success, companies must be prepared to share at least a certain amount of their intelligence in order to collaborate effectively. Intellectual property is important because it is necessary for commercial success. In a world where money matters, “intellectual communism” – where one offers innovation and value without receiving monetary compensation – simply doesn’t provide incentives. Therefore it makes sense to avert risk by withholding a certain amount of information; after all, collaborators today can easily turn into competitors tomorrow. Despite acknowledging the inherent value of intellectual property, companies must balance their safeguards with a more open approach in order to collaborate effectively, and thus reach their full potential. A great example of this kind of collaboration is the Human Genome Project: A few pharmaceutical companies were all working independently on their own human genome projects, but abandoned them and their property rights in order to collaborate with one another. Although some of them were competitors, they were still able work together on this specific project so that everyone could benefit from the results. However, companies can also make use of mass collaboration without ever endangering their products by using external resources and inviting the help of active consumers, dubbed “prosumers.” For example, the internet platform InnoCentive, which functions like an “eBay for innovation,” allows anonymous companies to take advantage of external resources by revealing the exact nature of a specific R&D problem, which the contributors then try to solve. Famous shoemaker John Fluevog is another great example of the way in which companies can use external resources. By creating “open source footwear,” he offered prosumers the chance to submit shoe designs and in doing so received many valuable ideas. Even though he alone chooses whether a design goes into production, his consumer-friendly strategy improved his reputation within his customer community. An effective collaboration starts in-house – indeed, the implementation of the principles of mass collaboration within one’s own organization is as important as finding good global partners. In fact, many companies already adopt this mindset: As the cost of finding partners continues to sink, it becomes more lucrative for businesses to focus on a core activity and then to outsource other functions whenever it is cheaper to do so. Since performing all the necessary tasks to produce a product in-house can be very expensive, it is only logical to delegate certain tasks to suppliers. For example, multinational firms like BMW make use of this logic in their business structure: while BMW itself focuses on managing, controlling and distributing its products, the “handwork” is increasingly handed over to specialist suppliers. And as the complexity of work and the expectations placed on employees continues to grow, giving autonomy to the workforce and welcoming enthusiasm in all its forms becomes an increasingly valuable in-house strategy. Indeed, vertical hierarchies prove counter-productive to the creative types of work, for example, which is often executed in teams. By forgoing these hierarchies and encouraging self-initiative and enthusiasm, companies can access the full potential of their employees. Google, for example, employs just this principle: their policy is to have their employees devote 20 percent of their work time to personal projects with the hope that this will prove profitable for Google in the long term. In addition, a company can simultaneously win their employees’ trust and motivate them to perform when they share important information with them. In fact, transparency within the organization guarantees that employees better understand their products, and can therefore better coordinate their work. Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz is also an advocate of this strategy, and regularly blogs about his job to ensure that his employees understand the decision-making process. Ultimately, mass collaboration is greatly beneficial to companies: it helps them to expand their operations, produce novel and exciting innovations, and create value in general. But perhaps most importantly, mass collaboration can bolster your bottom line: by collaborating with others on a massive scale, companies can squeeze more from less. For instance, mass collaborations can help reduce a company’s expenditures by splitting the cost burden between themselves and the cooperating companies, or they can boost their profits by sharing “useless” inventions. For example, Procter & Gamble did just that when they realized one day that they were using less than 10 percent of their patents! Rather than simply let this perfectly good intellectual property collect dust on the shelves, they decided to license the patents out in order to recoup the huge R&D costs of those languishing inventions. In addition, mass collaborations drive innovation and value forward by optimally allocating talent where it belongs, and by doing so can actually increase the speed at which innovations occur. For example, companies that partner with universities can take advantage of differing perspectives, thus helping them to not only focus on a single solution to a problem, but also remain open to many solutions. Mass collaborations also drive innovation by making it easier to find the very best person for the job: because people make willing, voluntary contributions to their collaboration, they are therefore more creative and successful. An example of this can be seen in Lego’s Mindstorm project, which served as an answer to consumers’ desire to participate in the development of their toys. Now each new idea contributed by the consumer makes the product, and the Lego company, more valuable. By now we’ve seen how mass collaboration can be a winning strategy for businesses; but it turns out that the implications of mass collaboration are much further reaching . . . Technology and the opportunities that it creates are an engine for social development. As a result, global collaboration is no longer limited to creating intellectual property, but has evolved into a culture in itself. The digital era has changed the way people think and therefore the way society as a whole functions. Indeed, the “Net Generation,” which has grown up amid ever-developing technology, has its own unique values, such as an emphasis on personal rights, co-creation of media content and skeptical views of authority, while valuing qualities like speed, transparency and playfulness. In addition, young people use technology in a way that might be foreign to older people: rather than simply being incredibly technically proficient, young people also use internet platforms as private spaces for self expression to overcome a lack of control and choice in the physical world. Furthermore, mass collaboration, specifically peer production, is transitioning from the immaterial world of the internet to the physical world. The classroom, which is generally thought of as a physical space, has begun to lose its tangibility: for instance, the TakingItGlobal’s Virtual Classroom project has revolutionized the learning process by connecting students and teachers from around the world, thus freeing them from the confines of the classroom. Global enterprises also use mass collaboration to produce goods by involving specialist partners for every step of the production process. In this way the end product is a sum of the many independent parts at work. A prime example of this is the creation of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner: its production involved 100 suppliers from six different countries who were granted almost complete freedom in implementing the part specifications. When they’ve completed their designs, they then send their work to Washington, where each part is fitted together like Lego building blocks. Clearly, the possibilities for development and creation are limitless with mass collaboration. Having moved from industry to society, we have to wonder where mass collaboration will lead next! The key message in this book: “Mass collaboration” isn’t a term that is often said aloud, and yet this phenomenon has a drastic impact on every part of our lives. Businesses face the choice of either collaborating or going the way of the dinosaurs, but it’s not all gloom: mass collaboration benefits us all through valuable innovations. Actionable advice: Collaborate to draw attention to your company. If you ever feel that your company is not being innovative enough or doesn’t get enough attention from consumers and the media, then you should consider finding ways to collaborate with other companies. By harnessing the power of the global community you’re more likely to find innovative solutions to your specific problems and rekindle your company’s relationship with consumers. Team up with other companies and share in the profits. If you have a great idea that you think will be groundbreaking, don’t hoard it for yourself! Go online and find people with similar ideas and collaborate with them. Doing so will help you to further develop your great idea, as well as share the cost burden of R&D, thus ultimately making your new product even more profitable.","headers":["What‘s in it for me: learn how to tap into the powers of mass collaboration.","In the digital age, mass collaboration affects almost every sphere of our lives.","The core principles of mass collaboration are openness, peering, sharing and acting globally.","The growing demands of a globalized economy mean that companies must massively collaborate or die.","Although mass collaboration offers many benefits, it also involves risks.","Companies should find the balance between protecting their intellectual property and opening up to mass collaboration.","The production and work process itself must be adequate to these strategies.

But some people, especially people who love to read but never have enough time to get through all the books they want to, might use one wish to gain the power to read with superhuman speed. There’s no guarantee that these blinks will give you superhuman reading skills, but you don’t need a genie to become a faster and better reader – you just have to learn how to shed some bad habits and practice a few techniques. 10 Days to Faster Reading explains that we can become faster readers in just ten days. These blinks compile the best of the book’s methods, tips and examples. Start practicing them right away with your daily newspaper, or any non-fiction material you might have lying around, and you’ll be on your way to becoming a faster reader, while remembering more of what you read. In these blinks, you’ll learn why we think about reading in the wrong way; how to get 40 percent of a book’s information without even reading it; and what happens to your brain when it’s not processing as much information as it could be. Too much to read, too little time. It’s a problem we can all relate to. Every day you find more interesting reading material, and every day the pile of “to-read” books grows taller and taller. But the problem isn’t necessarily time, per se. Rather, it’s that you’re not reading efficiently due to a few classic misconceptions about reading. First, you don’t actually have to read everything in a book or newspaper to understand it. In fact, it’s impossible to read everything that passes over your desk. Instead, you should get in the habit of selecting and prioritizing what’s actually important. We’ll come back to that point later, but as you’ll see, it’s quite easy once you know how to preview the material and efficiently determine the parts that actually interest you. Second, you don’t have to remember everything you read to get something from the material. We develop this misconception about reading in school, where we’re under pressure to remember everything we read in our textbooks because we’ll be tested on the material. However, memorized material is stored in your short-term memory and is forgotten after only a few days. If you want to retain the information for the future, you’ll need to create an easy retrieval system. Try writing down the crucial information (electronically or on paper), or make highlights and notes in the margins. Then, simply file the materials away. This way you can find the information easily, and it will also take away the pressure of memorizing everything. Finally, people have the misconception that they shouldn’t be reading during working hours. However, the opposite is true! Reading is actually part of your job description. Businesspeople tend to think that they’ll appear to be slacking off if they read on the job. Relevant reading materials, however, can help you come up with new business ideas, stay up to date on the market and find ways to beat the competition. So never be afraid to read at work – it’s crucial! If you do something enough times, you form a habit around it, and the same goes for reading. So what are some of the classic bad reading habits, and how do you fix them? A common bad reading habit is passive daydreaming. While we read, we’re thinking about a million other topics, none of which are related to what we’re actually reading. Our goal should be to turn this inefficient noodling into active mind wandering – a type of thinking that connects the information we’re reading to our own experience. This way, we bridge different types of knowledge: what we already know and the new information we’ll learn. Making the switch is as easy as steering your thoughts in the right direction. For example, imagine that you’re reading an article about Italian art. Allow your mind to wander to your trip to Italy last year. That connection works as a kind of brain glue to which you can easily stick new information. Another inefficient habit is regression, that is, rereading what you’ve just read. To avoid regression, try covering the text you’ve just read with a business card, leaving just enough space for the line you’re reading. Regression is often little more than wasted time, but if you really don’t get the author’s meaning or come across a word you don’t understand, it’s indeed worth going back over the material. Finally, lots of people subvocalize as they read, mouthing along to the words they read or mentally whispering the text. Normally, the brain can process up to 400 words per minute, but when we read at “talking speed,” we only read about 150 words per minute. So if you simply stop subvocalizing, you’ll be able to process more than twice as many words per minute! When you want to read for speed and stop subvocalizing, focus on the keywords and skip over the rest. Another strategy is to mumble, hum or chew gum while reading – these noises’ rhythms will speed you up. So now you know the bad habits. But how can you become a faster, more efficient reader? Start by following these three simple steps. First, have a clear purpose in mind and a sense of responsibility for what you read. This will help both with organization and concentration. Choose what to read and what to skip over by asking yourself, “Why am I reading this?” For example, if you want to improve your knowledge in a particular area or keep up to date with world affairs, then you can throw away the professional journals from two years ago! Then ask yourself, “Why do I need this information?” It can be for a test, a meeting or even to help your child to do better in school. But if your child already has good grades, do you really need to read over their work every day? So, before reading any material, ask yourself these two critical questions; if you can’t find a good answer, don’t read it. Second, pre-view all nonfiction material before actually starting to read in order to get an idea of what it’s about, as well as which parts will be relevant and interesting to you. Begin by reading first the first few introductory paragraphs to get an idea of where the intro is heading. Next, read the subheadings, titles and subtitles that are usually larger and bolded. Finally, read the first sentence of each paragraph in order to get a better idea of what each section is about. Pre-viewing provides you with background information, and thus helps you read and comprehend the text faster while reducing the tendency to reread. Once you have the background information, you don’t need to constantly reread to ensure you understood it correctly. Pre-viewing alone will give you a big portion – 40 percent, in fact – of the material’s key information. The rest is just elaboration, explanation or fluff. The third and final step is learning actual speed-reading techniques, which we’ll explore over the course of the following blinks. The third step in becoming an efficient reader is learning how to actually read faster. For most of us, reading training ended in elementary school, so our reading methods are quite outdated. These next blinks will provide you with new reading strategies that you can try out for yourself. Try them all, and see which ones work best for you. The first technique involves focusing only on important words and skipping over the rest. When we read, our eyes tend to jump around in stops and starts instead of a smooth flow. Getting into a better flow is as simple as finding keywords, which are the more important words in a sentence. Typically, they are longer than three letters and carry meaning. For example, try reading only the words in bold in the next sentence: The task is defined by a series of steps and elements. See? You don’t need to read the whole sentence to figure out the meaning, so just read the important words instead. Another strategy is to stop your eyes on thought groups instead of separate words. Imagine phrases as being separated by slashes: By looking for/thought groups,/you force your eyes/to move forward faster/while maintaining/good comprehension. Comprehending the whole phrase at each stop will require you to use your peripheral vision. You can train your peripheral vision in a number of ways, such as by quickly glancing at phrases and trying to repeat them. Or, if you’re in a traffic jam, you can quickly glance at the license plate of the car in front of you and try repeating it aloud. Don’t be surprised if your eyes feel strained as you practice these strategies, they’re just getting used to a new rhythm. The more you exercise your eye muscles, the better. Here are a few more great tricks to becoming a better reader: One way to overcome the habit of subvocalizing is to focus on the white space just above each line. This way, you can still see the top half of the letters and can thus easily understand them without becoming fixated on the words themselves. The idea here is to move through the words without getting stuck on any. You can do this more effectively if you aren’t looking directly at the words themselves. Another strategy called the indenting method involves using your peripheral vision. Instead of placing your eyes at the beginning of each line, try aiming them half an inch inside the left margin, and then stop reading half an inch before the right margin. You’ll still be able to see the beginning and the end of the line using your peripheral vision. By not focusing on all the words, you reduce the number of potential starts and stops that occur while glancing over the lines. If your eyes are stopping seven or eight times per line and you can cut it down by only one stop, your overall speed can increase by more than ten percent! This might feel unnatural for some. To help you get used to starting a line after it actually begins on the page, draw vertical lines about half an inch inside both margins. This way, you know exactly where to start and stop your eye movement. Re-learning a skill that you already have can feel frustrating. Just stick with it! It’s natural sometimes to get worse before you get better, and the rewards are definitely worth the frustration. When we learned to read as children, we always used a finger or another object to pace our reading and better understand the words. Why should we stop training that skill once we know how to read? We shouldn’t, and in fact it can be very helpful. Eyes naturally follow movement. For example, when there’s a fly in the room, your eyes notice it immediately. Likewise, pointing and moving your fingers can be used to guide your eyes more quickly through a text. Simply place your finger to the left or to the right of a line, and as you read across the line, move your finger slowly yet steadily down toward the bottom of the page. When reading narrow columns like the kinds found in newspapers, you can place your index finger in the center of a paragraph just under the line you’re reading. Move it either straight down or in the shape of a snake as you read across a line in order to guide your eyes. Next, cover the text you’ve already read in order to avoid regression. One way to do this is by using the business card method; another requires only using your hand. Make a fist with your left hand, and sticking your thumb out to the side. Then, just place your hand horizontally or vertically over the text you have just read. Just like the business card method you learned earlier, covering the text you’ve already read prevents you from rereading. These methods might be uncomfortable or even embarrassing, but they also help you develop fast reading habits. Just like training wheels, you can let them go once you no longer need them. The key message in this book: For most of us, reading training ends in elementary school, which means our adult reading habits are seriously outdated. If you want to get the most out of reading, you’ll need to re-learn how to prioritize, preview and speed up your reading in order to keep up with the fast-paced world. Actionable advice: Take a break every 20 minutes. Research shows that, while reading, people can only concentrate effectively for about 20 minutes at a time, so don’t overdo it. Give yourself a five-minute break every 20 to 30 minutes so your brain and eyes can rest. And don’t read for more than an hour before taking your break! What to read next: How to Read a Book, by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren By applying what you’ve just learned, you’ll soon be on your way to faster, and more efficient, reading. However, if you really want to take your reading skills to the next level, you should get our blinks to the aptly titled How to Read a Book, by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren.

You’re not alone. With Facebook, Instagram and smartphones always with us, constantly beeping and buzzing, craving our attention, getting things done is tougher than ever. So how do you fight these distractions and find your focus again? First of all, you need to accept that you can’t do everything. Then you need to make sure that the goals you have are really yours. Then it’s time to get going. Luckily, there are some neat tips and tricks that will make it easier for you to succeed. And it doesn’t require a lot of time either. Just 18 minutes. In these blinks, you’ll learn what Gmail’s “undo send” function can teach you about life; what jelly can teach you about choice; and why you should embrace your quirks. Sometimes waking up in the morning and looking at your to-do list can be overwhelming. Finding enough time to take care of everything can be a daily struggle. But with the right plan and some focused attention you can be your most productive self. First, find your focus by pausing for a moment, reflecting on what needs to be done and finding the best and most fruitful course of action. This pause will also lead to you making fewer mistakes. Take Gmail’s “undo send” function, for example. This feature gives you five seconds to reconsider whether you might regret that email you just sent. And five seconds is all most people need to pause and realize they’ve made a mistake. Of course, it’s more productive to avoiding writing and sending that email in the first place. Our initial instincts are often emotional, and the part of our brain that controls our impulses needs those few extra seconds to take control and put us on the right path. So, before you take action, slow down and take a moment to consider and to avoid wasting time. This pause can train your mind for long term success. You can think of life in terms of a marathon: It requires constant effort and endurance. Marathon runners gain endurance by breaking their week into four days of short runs, one day of a long run and two days of rest. And just like these runners you need this rest to reflect and put things in perspective. Pausing also allows you to think in new ways, leading to new possibilities. Without that break you’ll be on constant autopilot, acting out according to your idea of how things are supposed to be. This is the kind of behavior that leads to mistakes and missed opportunities. When you pause it gives your mind the chance to calm down, see things accurately and recognize the possibilities for productivity. So take the important first step and pause. Are you so ambitious you don’t know where to start? To find the best option for you, try to organize your life and focus on the things that matter most. Ask yourself what you want to accomplish in a day, week, year or lifetime. To attain these goals, you will need direction, and the key to getting on the right path is limiting your choices and taking advantage of your strengths. It is easier to take action when there are fewer options from which to choose. A simple way to narrow your options is to focus your attention on the things you are good at and work toward those talents and strengths. This can be a formula for being strategic about the things to which you dedicate your time and energy. Use this method to focus on approximately five things that will make a difference in your life. It might be improving your social life, being a better parent or launching a new product. By devoting 95 percent of your time to these goals, you’ll be directing your time and energy in the best possible way. Focusing on your strengths doesn’t mean ignoring your weaknesses. It is actually a good idea to embrace them! For example, say that one of your weaknesses is that you look at issues in very black-and-white terms. The author’s friend turned this weakness into an advantage by working on the issue of health reform. By not getting bogged down in unproductive arguments over gray areas, he used his stance of “I am right, you are wrong,” as a source of power to move things forward and excel at his job. So, when you are looking for direction in your life and choosing what to work on for the next day or year, take into consideration your strengths and weaknesses. You’ll be on your way to getting the right things done. Have you ever considered what makes you different and unique as a disadvantage? Don’t! It is a competitive advantage to be different from the rest! Today’s marketplace is crowded and people have more options than ever from which to choose. From bars and restaurants to technological gadgets and mobile applications, it’s the ones that offer something unique and different that stand out and succeed. If you are wondering what kind of successful project to work on for the next year, focus on the ones that have that special feature and stand out from the rest. Often times these differences can lead us to pursue our passion. It’s much easier and more enjoyable to spend time on things we are passionate about. It can take a lot of time to master something or perfect a certain skill, so it’s wise to turn your attention to something about which you’re passionate. Take learning an instrument, for example. A study at the Berlin Academy of Music revealed that it takes 8,000 hours of training to become a professional violinist. Those hours will go by much more quickly if you love what you are doing. But to be successful you have to avoid the pitfalls along the way. One common pitfall is the tendency to give up after a failure or misstep. Don’t fall into this one! Instead, pick yourself up and look at a failure as a chance to learn from your mistakes and make improvements. Another pitfall involves being paralyzed by uncertainty about the future. In reality, no one knows what the future holds – even a winning lottery ticket might turn into a future disaster! It’s better to focus on the present and creating your opportunities. So, now that you know what to look for – and what to avoid – it’s time to follow the plan. To follow through on a plan, you have to spend your time wisely. And to do that you need to have a system to keep you focused and on track. Luckily, there’s a simple 18-minute ritual you can follow every day. First, put aside five minutes in the morning to go over your plan for the day. In addition to things you would like to do, create an “ignore list” of things to avoid. This will help you navigate the work day and stay on target. For example, if one of your goals is to become a better parent, today you might decide to avoid seeking the advice of other parents and instead focus on listening to your child. Scheduling is a useful tool for getting things done. And this doesn’t mean saying, “I’ll get to it tomorrow.” Studies have shown that people are more likely to accomplish a task when they set a very specific time and place. Of course, sometimes things don’t go according to plan and you’ll need to reschedule. But don’t postpone things for more than three days. Try to find time later that same day or sometime soon, and if it still doesn’t get done it might be best to let it go. The next step is to give yourself a one minute pause every hour during the day. It’s easy to get overwhelmed at some point and lose your focus. In order to stay on track, take a short pause every hour to reflect on the progress you’ve made and what lies ahead. Afterward, you’ll be refocused and reenergized. The final step is to take five minutes at the end of the day to review. This is time to think about what did and didn’t work over the course of the day. Remember, learning from mistakes as well as victories is key to long-term success. Now that you have the power of the 18-minute daily plan it’s time to be the boss of your distractions. So, even though you may have a plan in place and a daily ritual to help you stick to it, you might be asking, “What about all the daily distractions?” Defeating distraction isn’t easy, and often the hardest part of accomplishing a task is getting started. You might find that simply changing your environment will help keep you focused. It’s easy to get distracted if you’re looking at the exact same wall every single day. Simply rearranging the chairs in a conference room can help people stay sharp in meetings. Staying motivated is easier when you make accomplishing your tasks fun. Say you have a long-term project in front of you on which it’s intimidating to even get started. Try making a game out of it. Split the project up into different levels to ease the pressure and set up gradually increasing rewards for “beating” those levels. Setting clear boundaries is important for a distraction-free work zone. If you’re working from a closed office, make it clear to everyone, even your kids, that your privacy is to be respected. If you have a knock-first-before-entering policy or a set do-not-disturb time, make sure to keep it enforced or else it can run the risk of being only a suggestion. Sometimes we are our own worst distraction. Here’s a counterintuitive trick to help: distract yourself from your distractions! Often times you can resist temptations to snack or check Twitter by simply stopping and sidetracking yourself. This is similar to pausing and re-focusing yourself on the task at hand. Now that you’ve mastered your distractions, it’s time to start your plan. So here’s a final tip: Start off small, the rest will come naturally. The key message in this book: Don’t do what others are expecting or what seems necessary, do what is right for you. Look at your unique strengths, weaknesses and passions. Then plan your year and follow the ritual of 18 minutes to help you reach your goals and overcome the distractions in your way.  Actionable advice: Celebrate and use failure instead of fearing it. Did you know Iceland is the happiest place on earth? That’s because Icelanders don’t stigmatize failures. And you shouldn’t either. By accepting and learning from your mistakes you will adopt a growth mind-set which can enable you to maximize your potential. Failure is inevitable but also educational. What to read next: Four Seconds, by Peter Bregman As you’ve just discovered, all you need is 18 minutes a day to keep on track with your goals and life plans. But, as valuable as this technique may be, you may still have moments when you feel overloaded or stressed. This is totally normal – but, unfortunately, in such moments it’s easier to act on impulse than to think rationally and carefully. In Four Seconds, you’ll learn how to control yourself in these moments of stress. If you pause briefly and focus on your breath, you’ll greatly improve your ability to make the right choice, even when the pressure is on. To discover more about how to maintain your composure, including why you should treat leadership like learning to ride a bike, head over to the blinks to Four Seconds. Got feedback?

Whether you’re working so hard that you can’t switch off to spend quality time with your family, or you’re so involved in looking after others that you never take any time for yourself, the pressures of the modern world can cause you to become disconnected from some parts of your life. But what if you could fully concentrate on everything you do throughout your day, from high-focus work to plain and simple rest and recharge? Rather than trying to find more time for one activity over another, Jeremie Kubicek and Steve Cockram have laid down the concept of 5 Gears, helping you to understand and apply the most appropriate gear to each part of your day. From slow speeds when you start and stop your engine to full-speed cruising down the freeway of your day-to-day, these blinks will explain what the different gears are and when you should use them. By following their lead, you can become more connected to all the situations and people you encounter every day. You’ll also find out why you should always pay attention to the kiss cam; how one of the authors ended up watching a professional wrestling match; and what you can learn from a three-wheel car from 1970s Britain. Have you ever been sat on a beautiful beach only to realize that your mind is still at the office? Well, you’re not alone. Many people find themselves not fully present but instead disconnected from the situations they’re in. Why? Just look at the experience of one of the authors, Jeremie Kubicek, who was working so hard that he was habitually late for dinner, his head still in his office paperwork, until his wife became so exasperated that it put a strain on their marriage. How did he get to that point? The disconnect stems from moving at different speeds to those around you. Imagine driving your car around the suburbs but traveling at freeway speeds; you’re bound to cause trouble and probably run somebody over. It’d be the same driving slowly down the freeway; you’re going to get in the way of other cars. Now imagine that the freeway is your office, and the suburbs are your home; if you don’t match your speed to your environment, then you’re going to hurt those around you. In short, Kubicek was driving too fast for his home! This led him and Steve Cockram to develop the concept of 5 Gears. In cars with manual transmission, you have multiple gears; you start in first and shift up to reach faster speeds, each gear being more appropriate to certain speeds than others. If you apply this idea to yourself and learn and understand your different gears, you can match your speed to your space. First gear is for individual recharge; second gear is for connecting deeply with friends or family; third gear is for casual socializing; fourth gear is for working and getting multiple tasks done; fifth gear is fully focusing on a single project. As in a car, each of these gears has a good and bad application, and smooth transitions are required to reach the different speeds properly. Over these blinks, we will look into and understand the pros and cons of each gear, as well as when to use them – or not. Let’s start with fifth gear. Have you ever been so in the zone and focused on something that time just flies by? This is fifth gear, where you effortlessly run at your most productive speed. Some people love this gear, but it’s not always appropriate, so how do you use it properly? Well, it’s brilliant for getting something specific done. Fifth gear is the highest in a car, maintaining fast speeds with less effort for a while. In the same way, your passion or competence at something allows you to get lots done with less effort once you transition into high gear. Look at Andrew, a client of the authors’ at Ford Motor Company, who uses fifth gear throughout the day to get in the zone and focus on getting important tasks done. However, it can cause conflict if he has to communicate with others. Andrew also operates an open door policy for constant communication with his team and found that he had trouble giving them his full attention if they came to him when he was in fifth gear, meaning the policy wasn’t helping anyone. Another example is a funny video on YouTube of a kiss-cam incident at a basketball game, where a man is so focused on the court that he ignores the camera on him and his date, causing her to kiss another man instead! Too much focus can cause you to miss opportunities at which you might otherwise jump. So how can you make sure you use fifth gear correctly? By detaching yourself from other interactions! Andrew eventually found that if he let people know that right now he was in fifth, they would leave him to it and come back later, allowing everyone to get what they needed. In the same way, if you schedule specific times for fifth gear and let people know they’ll have to wait, you can be sure to get your projects done without sacrificing focus or being too distracted to help other people. When the authors teach clients about the 5 Gears, a whopping 85 percent of leaders say that they’re most commonly in fourth gear. No wonder, since this is the most productive gear, jumping around between multiple tasks and dealing with many events in the course of a day. But is there a bad side to this? Well, as we saw earlier with Kubicek’s own experience, there unfortunately is. The more you try to do in fourth gear, the longer your to-do list gets, and the less you seem to be able to step outside of it. Renowned sports psychologist Dr. Jarrod Spencer likens the mind to a computer, that, at the end of each day, closes and files the documents we have been opening all day. But if we’re constantly opening new files without properly closing old ones, we can’t fully shut down and often have a harder time sleeping – or worse. Joe Hill from Minnesota is a client of the authors who used to work constantly and operate in fourth gear, running himself ragged until he burnt out. He narrowly avoided a premature death from blood clots in his lungs because of this! That’s not to say fourth gear is exclusively bad for you. In fact, it’s vital to getting things done no matter what your profession, but it needs to be balanced out by other gears and shifted into and out of appropriately. One of the most common examples of this is waking up and checking your emails, meaning that you run headfirst into the day in fourth gear. But imagine a sports team playing an important game; they don’t come charging out the locker room and straight onto the field without warming up first or warming down after! You also need to work up to fourth gear by spending a bit of time first and last thing every day in one of the lower gears. And if you use them appropriately, you’ll find that when you are in fourth gear, it runs even better! With that in mind, let’s shift down to third. Are you the sort of person who enjoys coffee-shop meetups or dinner parties with your friends? Then you’re the sort of person who enjoys third gear, which is all about informal socializing with others. But there’s more to third gear than having fun; it’s great for getting to know people and forging relationships, both personal and professional. This is why companies take clients out to lunch or to play golf: to get to know people better and decide whether they want to work with them and shift up to fourth gear. So why is it that despite its importance for work and pleasure, many people still dislike or feel uncomfortable using third gear? Well, it’s probably because of the diverse interests of the people with whom you end up socializing. No matter what you’re interested in talking about, you’re bound to meet people who’d rather discuss other things. But a little bit of curiosity in other people’s interests can bring you opportunities and increase your influence. Look at one of the authors, Kubicek, who once asked a fairly unassuming leader about his passions, expecting to hear something like “stamp collecting” only to be told “professional wrestling!” They ended up at a big wrestling event together that evening and had a great time. By being just a little curious, he was able to really get to know someone and make a brand new friend and business partner. In the same way, you can create new opportunities in third gear by being genuinely curious about other people’s interests and giving them your full attention, since you never know where it might lead. Just remember not to spend your whole life socializing in third gear – you wouldn’t get anything done or have time to relax and develop real relationships as you would when you shift down to second gear. You know those few people with whom you have a real connection? Maybe it’s your partner, your family or some close friends. The time you spend together forging those relationships is time spent in second gear. So why is this gear important? Because it’s about taking third gear and bringing it to a more meaningful level, moving from deciding if you’d like to know more about someone to developing a deeper relationship with them. Being truly present with someone and building more of a bond with them will bring personal growth, inspiration and peace of mind. However, it’s easy to think you’re in second gear when you’re not. Consider Debbie Corea, a senior associate of the authors’ company from Phoenix, whose work as a realtor puts her on call at all hours, so that she’s in fourth gear even at home, with her phone nearby. She was hardly present when spending time with her family. Even her husband and kids were constantly working or using social media, avoiding second gear and never actually connecting with one another despite spending time together. Second gear requires the most joint responsibility, as everyone must be truly in gear for it to work. Just as the open-door policy clashed with fifth gear, if someone comes to you in second gear and you’re not present too, you’re only wasting their time. So how can you make sure you reach second gear when you need it? You can start by putting your phone down. Another senior associate of GiAnt, Tom Nebel, used to lose quality time with his son to both of their phones until they finally agreed to shut them off and commit to second gear. He likens it to cowboys taking their guns off when entering the saloon, making sure everyone knew they weren’t looking for a fight! Make sure not to force it either; there’s nothing wrong with a bit of third gear if it’s not the right time for going deeper. And by the same token, sometimes you might just want to shift down to first. Imagine your phone only has ten percent battery, and you have an important call in an hour but no charger. It’s not going to happen, is it? Your phone just doesn’t have the energy to complete the call. So why do people think that they can run on empty without properly recharging? This is where first gear comes in, where you take a bit of time to yourself and replenish your spirit. Proper recharge is not the same as crashing in front of the TV every evening and weekend but gives you the energy to come alive, rather than just hiding from life. As with your phone, if you’re not fully charged, you won’t be fully present, at least not for long. So if you want to be at your best when you’re in other gears, you have to start by using first gear properly. So how exactly do you recharge? Well, that is the million-dollar question, since it’s different for everyone. For example, if you’re introverted, you may enjoy running or walking alone for exercise, reading a novel or maybe just pursuing a particular hobby. But if you’re extroverted, you might prefer exercising in a group, reading about your hobbies for inspiration or even talking with someone in second gear. It’s really up to the individual, but remember that it’s not a substitution for second gear; if you come home from work and go straight into first gear, you run the same risk of not being present during the second-gear phase as mentioned before. No matter how you recharge, just remember to try and fit in some first gear both first thing in the morning and last thing at night, whether it’s a morning yoga session or cooking family dinner in the evening. After all, you wouldn’t try to start or stop your car without using first gear, so why do the same with yourself? If you recharge regularly and effectively, then all your other gears will also run smoothly throughout your day. So we’ve now seen all 5 Gears, but there is still one more gear on a car’s transmission. In the 1970s, a UK car manufacturer built a three-wheeled car called the Reliant Robin. It was quite a comical-looking car with several drawbacks, most notably having no reverse gear. This was not a particularly nimble car, having to constantly struggle forward even when it was clearly a bad idea. In the same way, if you don’t know how to use your reverse gear and apologize for your mistakes, you won’t be living a very nimble life. It’s the difference between being responsive or resistant. Responsive people are aware of their responsibility for their actions and will reverse and make amends when it’s needed. Resistant people, on the other hand, would rather pass the blame than admit their mistakes and will fight instead of reconciling, thereby digging deeper and deeper holes. The distinction between responsive and resistant is important because it affects the way others view and respect you. Imagine watching a sportsman make a serious mistake; do the crowds prefer the one who tries to blame his teammates or the one who puts his hand up and admits he messed up? It’s always the latter – so long as they don’t do it again! Responsive people are also much easier to work with and be around because they can change direction and because they try to resolve issues instead of avoiding them. So how can you make sure you reverse correctly? Probably the most important thing is to use it sincerely – using an apology to get out of disagreements or manipulate others into getting what you want is not healthy behavior and the opposite of being responsive. Make sure you reverse only when you know you’re wrong, and then make sure you do it every time. The only other thing is to be sure to always learn from the experience; when you’ve overused another gear and run somebody else over, reverse, apologize and try not to do it again! So, now that you understand the 5 Gears concept let’s see how you can incorporate it into your routine. If you’re serious about understanding your gears and being present in each part of your day, then you need to get ready to work. You can’t expect to change just by hoping for it; you have to intentionally adjust your actions from here on out. The first thing to remember is that there is a correct time and place for every gear. Whenever you find yourself disconnected from a situation, missing opportunities or running somebody over, chances are you’re using the wrong gear for the context. The authors’ research found people generally move between five circles of influence: Self, Family, Team, Organization and Community. Each of these requires different gears to navigate appropriately, such as your family needing more second and third gear, or your self-focusing on first and fifth. The trick is to be aware of which circle you’re in at all times and which gear would be most appropriate. This awareness of context is the first step to maintaining the right gear. However, the most important step is to know yourself. The authors have a method for this: the CORE Process. First, you Call the issue, Own it, figure out how to Respond to it and then Execute this plan. If you apply this to yourself, you need to start with an honest appraisal of which gears you use the most; try ranking them from most to least used – and be truthful about it. Once you’ve called this, own it and try to understand how you’d rather have them ranked; do you need more first or second gear for yourself and your loved ones? Perhaps there’s too much socializing happening in third gear? Whatever you need, respond by figuring out a plan to make the adjustments, and then execute it! Whether it means putting your phone away when you’re with your family or using a landmark on your commute home to remind you to shift out of fourth gear, if you consciously make the effort to find a balance of all your gears, you’ll find yourself more and more present in every part of your day. You know the method; it’s time to utilize your gearbox to its full potential! The key message in these blinks: Many of us are stuck in one mode, but this isn’t enough. Understanding each of the 5 Gears and when best to use them is the key to being present in every part of your life. From the high focus of fifth gear to multitasking in fourth, socializing in third, connecting with your loved ones in second or taking time for yourself in first, each gear has a right and wrong time and place, even reverse! So long as you know which gears you lean on and which you avoid, you can start to apply the correct one to each part of your day, until you’re fully present in each situation. Actionable advice: Incorporate the language into your office or family. If you bring the terminology of 5 Gears to your home or office, you can easily let others know when you or they are in a different gear to what’s needed. If a colleague is still talking business at lunch, just tell them to switch to third, or if your child is looking for attention while you’re in fifth, flash them five fingers. The message is clear, and no one gets offended by a personal slight – it’s just a case of changing gear! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

We don’t have to traipse over to the library when we’re in need of some important information; we simply look it up on our smartphones. We don’t need to wait two weeks for the photos from our latest vacation to be developed; we can simply scroll through them on our iPhone or download them onto our laptop. And yet, despite these awesome benefits, living in a digital world also causes many problems. For one, the constant supply of information from our newsfeed and social media keeps us overloaded with information, and then there is our inbox, overfilled with tasks and reminders, demanding our attention. How to deal with this surfeit of input? These blinks outline some simple steps that’ll help you diminish the negative side effects of the digital world; follow them, and you’ll reap the benefits of being connected without suffering the costs. In these blinks, you’ll discover why no one should use a computer mouse, ever; why the best e-mail inboxes are completely empty; and why your to-do list should be online, not on paper. For centuries, whenever people wanted to record something important or transmit knowledge, they had to use paper, and as a medium for disseminating information, paper does offer plenty of advantages: it’s durable, easy to use and exceedingly cheap. Over time, however, we’ve begun to see paper’s disadvantages. For one, information stored on paper takes up lots of space. Just think of the shelves full of tomes in your local library. In our modern world, we’re replacing paper with bits, an information storage medium with unique properties that make it more time- and energy-efficient than any other. Bits are tiny electrical impulses in which huge amounts of information can be stored with almost no need of physical space. Combined with their very high transmission speed, bits can be shared easily with numerous recipients. Today, you can send an e-mail or publish an article that reaches millions of people worldwide in just a second – all with the click of a button. In the past, this kind of reach would’ve required many trees to produce the paper, and much ink for the writing out of the information. Your text would then need to be shipped around the world, consuming both fuel and time. Today, the number of bits in existence is constantly growing and flowing thanks to the internet and to interactive devices. Laptops, smartphones, tablets, PCs, cameras, and so on – all these devices produce, store and send bits. The internet has even freed bits from the limitations of physical space. A single article can be accessed all over the world – for years – without being subject to physical wear and tear. Virtually every industry has seen the benefit of bits and is integrating them into their production and distribution processes. As a result, the number of bits you deal with on a daily basis will only continue to grow. As you learned before, bits are merely electrical impulses – they have no weight. And yet they have the power to weigh people down, both mentally and emotionally. Today, we have more channels than ever before to interact with one another across various bitstreams, all demanding our constant attention and engagement. Text messages, instant messages, Twitter, Instagram, multiple e-mail accounts, Facebook, and so forth – how many of these channels demand your daily attention? If you are unable to manage these bitstreams, you may quickly become overloaded. While most people have learned the fundamentals of using a computer (web browsing, word processing, etc.), hardly any of us know how to deal with this constantly increasing influx of bits. There are two common reactions to bit overload. The first is passivity and avoidance of bitstreams. Is your e-mail inbox ever-growing and cluttered? Is your desktop full of files and icons? Then you’ve become passive due to bit overload. The second is the “always on” lifestyle, characterized by a hasty and urgent reaction every time your smartphone beeps. Both approaches lead to a gradual loss of control. As the bits pile up, they become stress-inducing distractions that affect productivity and quality of life. You can see this basically everywhere you go. Just think of all the parents and children that fiddle with their smartphones at the dinner table instead of spending quality time with one another. When faced with bit overload, your goal should be to reduce the load to zero, thus bringing relief and the ability to actively choose what to deal with next. And this is where Bit Literacy comes in – using your resources and tools to efficiently deal with the incoming bitstreams, always looking for reasons to delete, filter and let go of the bits in order to “achieve emptiness.” Okay, but how do you engage with bits in a healthier way? Our following blinks will give you the tools you need to engage with bits on your terms. How many unread e-mails are in your inbox? 1,000? More? The most commonly mishandled bitstream of all is e-mail. But why? In part, this is because people use their e-mail inbox to do things it wasn’t designed for, thus leading to an ineffective and demoralizing workflow. For example, many people think it’s clever to use their inbox as a to-do list, sending themselves reminder mails to keep track of important tasks. However, each e-mail competes for your attention with all the other e-mails, making each e-mail (including your reminders) hard to find, easy to forget and impossible to prioritize. The same applies to using your inbox as a storage system for passwords, contacts, lists, bookmarks, and so forth. Like your to-do lists, this important information gets lost in the clutter.   Obviate this problem by differentiating your e-mails from their content. The content of an e-mail should determine how it is handled. For example, if you have an e-mail instructing you to write a report, you should put this task on a to-do list, where you can prioritize it with other to-dos. Similarly, dates should be marked in your calendar, addresses should be saved in your address book, links in a bookmark, and so on. Empty your inbox at least once a day by moving e-mails to their proper places. Start by reading through personal e-mails from friends and family; savor the experience, and save the ones you want to keep in a personal folder. Delete the rest. Next, it’s time to go through any newsletters and other “FYI” e-mails. If you have the time, read them. Otherwise, delete them. Finally, if you have any to-dos in your inbox, go ahead and take care of them, as longs as they’ll only take two minutes or less. Otherwise, create a to-do on your to-do list. By establishing a daily routine that keeps your inbox completely empty, you minimize the time you have to spend with e-mail, leaving more time for actual work. Once you’ve emptied your inbox, savor the feeling for a moment. Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment.  Now it’s time to move on to your to-do list. Notepads and Post-Its won’t do in our bit-happy world. There’s simply too much to do and not enough paper to keep everything organized. So try using Good Todo, the simple yet incredibly efficient bit-literate to-do tool. Good Todo has a calendar with a prioritizable to-do list for every day, allowing you to focus on only today’s work without worrying about the future. Each task is assigned a time when it is to be worked on or completed – because before that date, it’s just a distraction.  To understand why this is important, imagine that you’ve put a sticky note on your refrigerator that says “Pick up dry cleaning on Friday.” Today, however, is Monday. You’ll have to see it for at least three days without being able to take action! Not only is this demoralizing, it also makes it easy to forget if other things come up. Another one of Good Todo’s benefits is simplicity. It’s exceedingly easy to create to-dos: all you have to do is forward or CC an e-mail. For example, by simply forwarding a message to 2w@goodtodo.com, you’ve created a to-do that is due in two weeks time. The subject line becomes the summary of your to-do, and the message will be saved in a detail field. This simplicity makes Good Todo perfect for things like follow-ups. For instance, if you e-mail someone about a report they are to hand in, BCC the e-mail to 1w@goodtodo.com to create a reminder set for one week from today. Then, you’ll be sure to remember to check whether you got the report! Do you ever feel guilt or embarrassment for not being well informed? Perhaps you wished you could take part in a heated pop-culture or political discussion, but instead stuck to the sidelines, smiling and nodding. In today’s world, it’s easy to get information about anything online. Since the information is there, you might as well become an expert, right? Actually, wrong. While we have access to more media than ever before, it’s impossible to read through all the available sources, and unhealthy to even try. Some years ago, urbanites had access to about a dozen different media sources. Since the advent of the internet, however, we now have thousands or millions of different media choices. Trying to consider them all – let alone read them! – is simply out of the question.  Instead, you should maintain a media diet, a small set of carefully selected sources that provide you with the information you actually need.  Note which media continually offer you valuable information; these are the sources with content worth reading all the way through. Know which media sources reliably offer you some valuable information, and are thus worth skimming (but not reading thoroughly). Also, you should always know why you consume a specific piece of media. Was it valuable in the past? Did you find it amusing? Did it offer you a specific piece of valuable information? The answers to these questions will help you streamline your media diet. Remember, it’s your responsibility to keep your media diet as light as possible. Whenever you read anything, ask yourself: “Is this worth my time?” If it’s not, skip it. Most people’s desktops are cluttered with files. The problem is that they follow the “organization by default” scheme, saving files to the destination suggested by the program they are currently using. This strategy quickly reduces our desktop to a chaotic and confused stockpile. A better approach is to minimize potential locations for files and photos by using a two-level storing system and naming your files effectively. Create a single “top level” folder for each of the projects you are working on. It could be your master’s thesis or your cooking projects, the draft of your novel or some other important work project. Each of these folders will have only a single sub-level of folders. For example, in your work folder, you could have a sub-folder for e-mail conversations, deliverables, memos, team contact information and so forth. It is simply not necessary for you to complicate things with “deeper” organization. Next, name your files such that each part of the name gives you information about it. Use this system consistently so that all your newly saved files are automatically sorted. For example, written documents, like reports, notes, and so on, could be named using the following scheme: author initials-month-date-topic. A book draft submitted by Joe Schmoe on January 22, for instance, would be named: js-0122-bookdraft. Then all you have to do is let your computer automatically sort it by date. However, most kinds of data are photos, and the challenge is not only storing them, but also filtering out the ones you want to keep and letting go of duplicates and poor shots. In the digital era of bits, taking photos is free and easy. While taking lots of photos increases the odds of getting a good shot, you’re then left with tons of imperfect ones as well. To stay organized, focus on quality, not quantity. Keep only those really fantastic shots, and let go of the rest. When people get excited about something they’ve found online, they understandably want to share it. But they aren’t always mindful of how they share. They send you e-mails with cryptic or unhelpful subjects, like “Read today’s business section” or “Saw you in the newspaper.” Luckily, with just a few tricks, you can share information in a more bit-literate way. A bit-literate message structure gets to the point as fast as possible, backs up the information and then ends. This is called frontloading – the ordering of pieces of information from most to least important. Instead of writing a subject line like “Everything you need to know about the upcoming conference in Chicago,” write something more too the point, like “Chicago conference: schedule, agenda, directions.” Not only is the second option more descriptive, it’s also shorter. Frontloading also applies to the body of an e-mail and any other bit medium, such as Powerpoint presentations, documents and memos. Here, you should be especially careful to make sure that the context of the information you’re sharing is obvious to the recipient. By default, e-mails include contextual information, such as the date, sender and subject line. PowerPoints, documents and memos, on the other hand, do not. It’s up to you to include the who, when, for whom and why. Furthermore, when drafting e-mails, remember that the recipient is probably also overloaded. Like you, they value their time – and don’t have much to spare. For example, if you send your friend a link, she has to deal with the extra burden of figuring out what it is and why she should read it. Instead, create a text file or e-mail that includes the URL of the site, the source, date, author, a short reason why you think it’s important, followed by the article’s complete text. This way, the recipient doesn’t have to do any extra work. What would you think if you saw someone start their car by getting out, opening the hood and fiddling with the wires, then closing the hood again and getting back into the car. You’d probably think: “What a goof! Why don’t they just use the ignition?!”  Well, this is basically what computer geeks think whenever they see you use the mouse to save a document. Bit-literate users avoid using the mouse as much as possible in favor of using the keyboard. Grabbing the mouse and moving the cursor across the screen is slow, and requires conscious effort. On the other hand, typing is both fast and easy – meaning that keyboard shortcuts are, too. Learning keyboard shortcuts and one-touch access allows you to easily access and manipulate bits as quickly as you can think. There are many programs out there that can help you make use of your keyboard. QuicKeys, for example, allows you to bind an application to a certain key. F5, for instance, could be for your e-mail client; F6 for your text editor; F7 for your browser; and so on. Once you’re in a program, virtually every operation is associated with a keyboard shortcut. Imagine, for instance, that you want to save an article’s text for a friend. Press Ctrl-A to select the text then Ctrl-C to copy it. Open your text editor with F6, and press Ctrl-N to make a new file. Press Ctrl-V to paste the text in the document and Ctrl-S to save the file. The whole thing takes less than five seconds. Another bit-literate habit is delegating repetitive tasks to the computer by using programs – such as Typinator – to define your own abbreviations and correct misspellings on the fly. For example, if you often have to write out the name of your firm, you could define “mf-space” as the fully written name of your firm. Take note of phrases you have to constantly write out and define shortcuts to save yourself some time. The key message in this book: In the world of bits, information comes at us constantly from every direction. It’s time to get “bit literate” by taking responsibility for the way you engage with bits. By developing sleek organizational systems for your computer use, you can free up your time to get some actual work done.

Whether it’s your phone buzzing in your pocket with the latest tweet, a colleague interrupting you in the middle of an important task or the daily barrage of emails, your time is constantly being stolen from you, minute by minute, hour by hour. And once you’ve lost that time, you can never get it back again. To remain focused and make sure these time thieves don’t get the upper hand, you need to keep a few tricks up your sleeve. These blinks will get you started. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the number 1,440 is so important; about the 321-Zero system; and how many books George W. Bush read throughout his presidency.   Do you ever wish you could have an extra hour in the day to read, exercise or hang out with the people you love? Well, you can and there’s no magic required! But first, you need to understand how precious time is. That’s why the first secret of time management is learning that time is your most valuable asset and that, once it’s lost, you can never get it back. A good way to monitor this precious resource is by breaking it down. For instance, there are 1,440 minutes in a day, each of which should be invested wisely. To remind himself of this fact, the author taped a “1,440” poster to his office door. It reminds him of the limited time in each day. But why use minutes? Why not think about the 86,400 seconds that every day offers? Well, there are a bunch of daily tasks that you can actually do in a minute, like knocking out 30 sit-ups, reading a poem or watering a plant. This fact makes minutes key to monitoring your time. Okay, now that you appreciate how valuable time is, it’s time to start prioritizing it. This is where the second secret comes in: determine and prioritize your most important task, or your MIT. This is the single task that will have the biggest impact on your life or work. Just take Therese Macan, a professor at the University of Missouri-St Louis. She found that one of the most important productivity determinants is the ability to identify priorities. So pinpointing an MIT is central to time management. For instance, if a senior executive sets a goal of developing a new app, her MIT might be to hire a new programmer. Or the MIT for a start-up CEO could be to prepare a great presentation to land a major investment. Research has shown that having a daily MIT, whatever it is, results in greater levels of happiness and improved focus. Lots of people are weighed down by never-ending to-do lists. Take a look at yours. How many of the tasks have been lingering there for weeks, unnecessarily stressing you out? You probably have at least a few such tasks, and the best way to deal with them is by pulling out a good old fashioned calendar. Here’s where the third secret comes into play: ditch your to-do list and pick up your calendar to de-stress your day. Research has found that an average of 41 percent of items on to-do lists never actually get completed. One of the reasons for this shocking statistic is that the tasks on such lists usually aren’t accompanied by a note stating how long it’ll take to complete them. As a result, tasks that are more difficult or less important generally get left undone. That might not be such a problem, except for the fact that the unfinished items on your to-do list will inevitably produce a lot of stress that could just as easily be avoided. In fact, researchers from Florida State University discovered that you can avoid this stress by simply coming up with a plan to complete a task. The Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller offers a good example. She succeeded at spending time with her family, completing her school obligations, training for the Olympics and even doing media interviews, all by scheduling time for important tasks. This strategy is known as time blocking or time boxing and, incredibly, all it requires is maintaining a detailed calendar. By doing so, Miller forced herself to prioritize tasks that would bring her closer to achieving her goal and, to this day, she keeps an almost minute-by-minute schedule. However, you’ll inevitably encounter tasks on your calendar that you can’t accomplish. When this happens, instead of letting them drift into the past, simply reschedule. For example, if you usually make it to the gym at noon, but have a flight to catch at the same time, simply move your workout to earlier in the day. Everyone’s been there: an important deadline is creeping up and, instead of working on the project at hand, you’re planted in front of a screen – scrolling through Facebook, texting a friend or watching your favorite TV show. Procrastination is a tough one, but, luckily, there are strategies to break free from it and start getting things done. This is where the fourth secret comes in: procrastination can be overcome by imagining your future self. After all, you don’t procrastinate because you're lazy, but because you don’t have sufficient motivation. Imagining yourself in the future can fix this problem and it’s as simple as asking yourself two questions: “What pleasure will I get by doing this thing?” and “What pain will I feel if I don’t do it?” For instance, if your goal is to work out every single day, but you can’t get yourself to exercise, just imagine having a huge beer belly and feeling totally sluggish. Such a mental routine will get you off the couch and onto the treadmill. At the same time, being honest about the actions your future self will take can also help you achieve your goals. For example, if you know you’ll be inclined to eat unhealthy snacks during a future break, you can protect yourself by throwing out all the junk food in your house. You could even go a step further by filling the house with healthy options like baby carrots and hummus. From there, you can move on to the fifth secret: there will always be more to do; you can’t do everything. And, actually, that’s fine! In fact, prioritizing and scheduling the tasks you want to do is much more valuable than crossing off as many items as possible. Just take President George W. Bush as an example. He knew there would always be more to do. So instead of trying to do everything, he made it his priority to read tons of books, since he found it therapeutic and educational. As a result, he read some 95 titles during his presidency! Have you ever had an incredible idea while shopping for groceries or walking the dog? Wouldn’t it be great if, instead of straining to remember it later, you could just jot it down right then and there? That’s why the sixth secret is to always have a notebook handy. After all, writing down your thoughts helps you hold onto them. Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson says he never would have built his business empire without his trusty notebook. He was so committed to writing down his ideas that, one time when he had a business idea and no notebook, he wrote down the thought in his passport! For him, if an idea doesn’t get written down, it could be lost forever. Taking notes by hand also helps your memory. For instance, the psychologists Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer found that students who hand wrote their notes during a TED talk were better able to recall the material than students who took notes on their laptops. Writing down your thoughts is crucial – as is maintaining control over your schedule, which is where the seventh secret comes into play. It says that you should avoid checking your email too often, lest other people dictate how you spend your time. In fact, contrary to popular belief, constantly checking emails is unproductive. That’s because the anticipation felt when checking your inbox is comparable to pulling the handle of a slot machine. Often, you check your messages, and there’s nothing new. But sometimes there is a new message. This unpredictability is addictive, and one begins to check more and more often, hoping for the hit of dopamine that a message affords. Obviously, this costs you time and interrupts your focus. A good way to untether yourself from your email is by unsubscribing from newsletters by using a program like unroll.me. But you can also adopt the 321-Zero system. To do so, just limit yourself to three email checks per day, while trying to get your inbox to zero in just 21 minutes. If you’ve ever had an office job, you know how incredibly boring meetings can be. But that’s not the only problem with meetings. The eighth secret is that most meetings are inefficient and you should only schedule them as a last resort. In fact, a 2015 survey found that 35 percent of respondents considered weekly status meetings to be a waste of time, for these two primary reasons: First, in accordance with Parkinson’s law of triviality, meeting participants tend to waste lots of time on insignificant issues. Second, extroverts usually dominate meetings, making others less likely to participate. As a result, valuable information might not be shared during such gatherings. That being said, if you absolutely have to have a meeting, opt for a stand-up affair rather than a sit-down one. This might seem odd, but researchers at Washington University found that meetings during which participants stand result in better collaboration, less attachment to ideas, higher levels of engagement and more effective problem-solving. The Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, offers another good tip: by scheduling meetings based on increments of five or ten minutes, she’s able to have up to 70 meetings a week. If she stuck with the standard 30-minute block she would never be able to accomplish this. In other words, controlling the timing of meetings will prevent people from sucking up your time. This is key since other people will constantly ask you for things, a fact that dovetails nicely with the ninth secret: achieve your immediate goals faster by saying no to most things. After all, every time you say yes to something, you’re saying no to something else. The Olympic rower Sara Hendershot is a good example. She’s a pro at saying no to social and other engagements. This hard-learned skill enabled her to keep her eyes on the prize in the lead up to the 2012 Olympics in London, where she qualified for the finals. As a cherry on top, research has even found that people who tend to say no in response to requests for their time are happier and have more energy.  By now you know that it’s essential to spend your limited time on tasks that will have the greatest impact. The tenth secret can help you do that. It says that by applying the Pareto Principle you can uncover shortcuts to success. Here’s what that means: In the 1890s, the Italian philosopher and economist Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto found that 20 percent of the pea plants in his garden produced 80 percent of his healthy peapods. He extrapolated this 80/20 rule into the general principle that now bears his name. It can be applied to a number of areas. For instance, by applying the 80/20 rule to your employees, you might decide that the majority of your salespeople should be let go since they’re your lowest performers. From there, you could focus your energy on the remaining 20 percent, who already generate 80 percent of your sales, by giving them rewards and greater levels of support. The end result will likely be an overall improvement in sales. Or you could use the 80/20 rule in your personal life by analyzing the tasks you do on a weekly basis, then identifying which of them has the greatest impact. That being said, you can also accomplish more by critically assessing the tasks in front of you. The eleventh secret is designed to help you do that. It says that leveraging your skills and delegating work will increase your productivity. Just take a 2013 experiment published in the Harvard Business Review by the professors Julian Birkinshaw and Jordan Cohen. It found that 43 percent of workers were unsatisfied with the tasks they do at work. By simply training employees to slow down and ask themselves a few questions, the study’s authors were able to identify important tasks, freeing up an extra eight hours per week. The first question they had people ask themselves was, “How important is this task to the company?” Then, “Is there anyone else who can complete it?” And finally, “How could this task be accomplished if I had half as much time?” On a normal day in the office, do you ever have difficulty focusing? Most people do and a little bit of advice here can go a long way. This is the twelfth secret, which says that grouping your work into recurring themes each week will make you more effective. A great example comes from Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square. He says that the secret to running both his companies was to have a theme for each day. For instance, on Mondays, he would focus on management; Wednesdays would be dedicated to marketing; and Sunday would be reserved for reflection, feedback and strategy for the next week. Or take the entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan. He recommends theming each week based on three types of days to stay focused and remain invigorated. The first type is called a focus day, which is for vital activities like revenue-growing tasks. The second type is called a buffer day, which is for catching up on emails, returning calls, having meetings, delegating tasks and doing paperwork. And finally, a free day is one on which no work should be done. This last type is reserved for vacation, family time and charity work. Another simple way to boost your efficiency has to do with tackling small tasks. This is the thirteenth secret, which says that you should immediately take action on tasks that’ll take fewer than five minutes to accomplish and avoid returning to the same task over and over. Just consider the straight-A student Nihar Suthar. He completes five-minute assignments right away, avoiding a long list of tiny tasks. Or take the author. His sister Debbie recently emailed him, but instead of writing her back, he called her to make sure they could talk. By scheduling a call in his calendar and thereby saving the mental energy he would otherwise spend trying to remember to get back to her, he decided to handle this task immediately. If he had instead put it on a to-do list or left it in his inbox, he probably would have never remembered to address it. Imagine waking up at six in the morning, working out for 45 minutes and then whipping together a delicious, high-protein breakfast. It might sound difficult but the fourteenth secret shows why it’s essential. It says that dedicating the first hour of each day to a morning routine will enhance your health – mind, body and soul. In fact, starting the day with a workout is a great way to get your creative juices flowing. Just consider the New York Times best-selling author Dan Miller, who starts off each day by meditating for half an hour, then working out for 45 minutes while listening to audio programs. He avoids checking the news or looking at his phone during this time, devoting his first hour to positive and inspirational experiences. He even claims that his most creative ideas come to him during this daily “me time.” From there, you can further increase your energy and well-being by eating a healthy breakfast and drinking lots of water. This is huge for the best-selling author and podcast host Shawn Stevenson. He considers energy to be everything, and so he starts off each day with what he calls an inner bath. He simply drinks 30 ounces of purified water to jumpstart his metabolism by flushing out waste. In fact, according to the fifteenth secret, energy is paramount. The secret is that productivity isn’t about time, but about maintaining focus and energy. That’s why Francesco Cirillo came up with the Pomodoro Technique – a method designed to reduce distractions and boost productivity. His approach involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, devoting your full attention to a single task for the full 25 minutes and then taking a five-minute break before repeating the cycle. Author Monica Leonelle found ample success with the Pomodoro Technique after realizing that she didn’t have a single spare hour in the day. By using the Pomodoro Technique, she recharged during her breaks, maintaining steady energy throughout the day and, with the help of other techniques, went from writing 600 words per hour to 3,500! The key message in this book: Highly successful people consider time to be their most valuable asset. By applying their most effective life hacks – which do everything from prioritizing tasks to boosting your energy and keeping you focused – you too can make the most of your time.  Actionable advice: Design a morning routine! When forming your morning routine, use the LIFE S.A.V.E.R.S system developed by the success coach Hal Elrod. This acronym will help you include the most important things. S stands for Silence to foster gratitude and meditation A is for Affirmations of goals and priorities V is for Visualizations of your ideal life E is for Exercise R is for Reading And the final S is for Scribing in your journal.

Did it hit you when you were reading Twitter or group texting some friends? Or maybe that genius thought struck you during a two-hour session of YouTube binge-watching? No? Well, if you, like the author, realized that the last time you had a brilliant thought was the last time you were bored – whether you were taking a long, aimless walk or an extended shower – you’re not alone. In fact, our brains need boredom in order to get truly creative. So how can you unplug from all the digital distractions and benefit from that rare human emotion of boredom? These blinks show you the way. They explain how boredom fuels creativity and give you some pointers for improving your digital habits. Finally, you’ll be given a challenge that’ll help you unplug entirely – at least for a little while. In these blinks, you’ll also learn that mobile games aren’t just a waste of time; how to improve your memory; and the right way to take a fakeation. It’s Sunday afternoon and you’ve got nothing to do. Truly nothing – the internet is down, you’re all alone, your phone is dead and there aren’t any books. You get the picture. Does this sound like the most mind-numbingly boring and awful thing ever? To give you a sense of the level of dislike we have of boredom, consider a study conducted at the University of Virginia. In the experiment, participants were exposed to three types of stimuli: music, images and mild electric shocks. After some time, the participants were asked whether they’d be willing to pay to stop the shocks, and 75 percent of them said they would. The participants were then given 15 minutes to think things over. They were left alone and given a button that, if pressed, would shock them. Here’s the weird part: one-third of the participants who’d said they’d pay a fee to make the shocks stop decided to press the button in an attempt to keep the boredom at bay. So we prefer the pain of minor electrocution to the agony of boredom. This is a shame, because boredom is a boon. For starters, it can boost creativity. Think back to the last argument you had. Did you manage to deliver quip after biting quip, utterly vanquishing your opponent? Or was it later, when you were alone, that you came up with those perfect comebacks? When we’re engaged in the moment, our executive attention network kicks into action. Although this makes us more ready and alert, it inhibits and controls our attention, making it harder to cook up great ideas. It’s only in moments of boredom that this network switches off, and our brains shift toward creative thinking. You see, our brains don’t just shut off when we’re bored. They’re still very active, using about 95 percent of the energy that an engaged brain requires. The difference is this: when bored, we become less focused and our mind starts drifting, shuffling through old memories and reflecting on the present and the future. We create unexpected connections, which lend themselves to creativity. So boredom isn’t all bad – but it sure is rare these days. Take a walk down the street, or spend a few minutes on the subway or a bus, and you’ll see them: hordes of people with their heads lowered, each gazing at the screen of some device. Sure, smartphones and tablets are great – you’re probably using one right now! – but they’re also altering the way we think and act. For one, we no longer read or process information as we used to. When investigating why people were having difficulty getting immersed in books or other long texts, writer Mike Rosenwald made a discovery: the internet has altered the way we read. Pre-internet, people read linearly. Today, our reading is utterly nonlinear – we scroll and skim and follow links to other stories. And all this skipping, skimming and scrolling is affecting our ability to engage with long stretches of text. An ironic case in point is that only 30 percent of the people who began Rosenwald’s article about his research managed to read it to the end. But it’s not only the internet that’s at fault; screens are also reducing our reading comprehension. Anne Mangen, a professor at the University of Stavanger in Norway, conducted a study that had some participants read a mystery story on an e-reader and others read the same story in a bound book. The emotional experience of reading was similar for all participants; however, those who read the story in book form were much better at answering questions about the chronology of events. In a similar vein, digital photography, and our incessant picture-taking, is affecting our memory. These days, people take dozens of pictures per day, attempting to capture and broadcast every moment. But it’s been shown that the moments we try to keep this way actually become harder to remember. In an experiment, Linda Henkel of Fairfield University had subjects tour a museum. They were told to take photos of some objects. Others, they were instructed to merely observe. The result? Participants had a much easier time remembering the details of objects they’d only observed and hadn’t photographed. What do drug dealers and people in the tech sector have in common? No, the answer isn’t, “Too much money.” It’s that they both call their customers “users.” This is no coincidence. Many of today’s devices and platforms are as addictive as any drug – and companies want it that way, for our attention is their most valuable asset. Indeed, companies know how to exploit our instincts so that we remain riveted. Have you ever heard of the endowed progress effect? Well, here’s how it works: We tend to favor tasks that we believe we’re close to completing. The human brain has evolved to long for completion, and the endowed progress effect makes people feel that they’re on the verge of it. This is why LinkedIn, among other companies, displays a profile “completion” bar. By constantly reminding you that you’re almost done, the site increases the likelihood of your sticking around and actually setting up a profile. In the opinion of digital marketing expert Nir Eyal, such subtle manipulation is a kind of mind control, which can be as addicting as alcohol, cigarettes or any other drug. Eyal argues that between 2 and 5 percent of technology users become severely addicted; reason enough, he claims, to mark digital devices and products with a special label: potentially addictive. But many modern companies do more than exploit our preexisting instincts and deep-seated habits; they seek to create completely new habits, too. Have you ever thought about why mobile gaming companies limit the length of play or the number of lives you have? Well, we value scarce resources – so having little play time or limited chances to play makes us value the game. It also forces us to play again and again, which is habit-forming. Companies have even found new ways to give comfort. People don’t like uncertainty, which is why Uber, right after you request a ride, shows you precisely where your driver is. The comfort derived from this experience makes users more likely to use the service in the future. You’ve probably seen “no laptops” signs in cafes by now. There is, in fact, a fast-spreading no-tech trend, with people organizing technology-free retreats and some live music acts even forbidding the use of phones. But what good can pocketing your phone really do? Well, for one, disconnecting from technology can help you connect with others. In a Virginia Tech study, participants were put into pairs and asked to talk with each other for ten minutes. Some people chose to put away their mobile device; others put it on the table or held it in their hand. And the presence or absence of these devices made a big difference. Empathy levels were reported to be higher when mobile devices were absent. Even if the discussion partners knew each other well, the presence of a device drove empathy below the level of device-free partners who were complete strangers. Or consider Laura Norén, an NYU professor who decided to act on research from Princeton and UCLA that indicates that taking handwritten notes improves information retention. After noticing that students seemed less engaged when typing, word for word, what she said in class, she put a classroom ban on laptops. And this dramatically improved the students’ ability and willingness to join in class discussions. Taking a break from technology is similar to taking a break from work, which most companies now know is absolutely crucial. BCG Consulting learned this the hard way. Yes, it was a top management-consulting firm. Yes, new employees were always committed and eager. But there was a problem. The work was intense, and consultants were on call every day, at all hours, and those initially chipper and excellent workers usually burned out in under five years. So economist Leslie Perlow proposed a solution: select a midweek day on which consultants wouldn’t be allowed to work or make any team communications. She got a team of consultants to take a free day, and, being utterly unused to having any time for themselves, they initially panicked. But this solution proved remarkably effective. BCG’s management backed it, and the consultants both recovered in their personal lives and improved their teamwork. So taking a break from technology, or from work, certainly has its benefits. It’s up to you to actually take that break. Most of us have done it. We install a game on our phone, thinking it might be a fun, occasional pastime, but before we know it, we’re totally hooked, playing whenever there’s a free minute. Whether it’s Candy Crush, Clash of Clans or Two Dots, these games are often regarded as a waste of time. But that’s an oversimplification. Depending on how we play them, mobile games can actually be beneficial. According to Jane McGonigal, an author and game developer, there are correct and incorrect ways to play games. It’s best to play them in brief spurts, and to make meaningful connections between the game and reality. Doing this can, according to McGonigal, improve your mental state. On the other hand, you shouldn’t get so immersed in the game that reality falls away. If you do this, you may be using the game to escape your real-life problems, which, more often than not, only makes these problems worse. So choose your games wisely. McGonigal believes that some games can reduce stress and anxiety, so if you struggle with these feelings, playing the right game occasionally for about ten minutes can have very beneficial effects. It’s equally important that we teach our children healthy gaming habits, rather than banning games entirely. Consider computer teacher Joel Levin, who introduced his daughter to Minecraft when she was four years old. The game allows players to explore a randomly-generated world, and Levin watched as his daughter interacted with each new world. It struck him that the game would be an excellent teaching aid. Indeed, with its help, his daughter had already learned to spell her first word. So Levin introduced his class to Minecraft. It was such a hit that he eventually developed an educational version with the game’s creators. Today, MinecraftEdu helps students in more than 7,000 classrooms, spread across 40 countries, learn math, history, social studies and much more. When approached correctly, games have the potential to do plenty of good. So it’s important that we teach, and model, healthy digital behavior – and that’s what the next blink is all about. Kids like excitement. And there’s a lot of excitement available these days, from mobile games to flashy ads to YouTube videos. But the drawbacks of nonstop excitement and stimulation are myriad. Modern-day technology has such a powerful effect on childhood development that many tech giants don’t let their kids use any devices at all. Steve Jobs, for example, wouldn’t let his kids use an iPad. And there’s a good reason for these strict policies. Consider the research of Dr. Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, who studies the way youths interact with social media. Her findings show that children who frequently use social media tend to be both less empathic and less adept at creatively solving real-world problems. It’s also been shown that social media affects how young people form opinions. In one study at UCLA, Lauren Sherman created a simulated Instagram feed and had individual participants from a group of youths rate the pictures. But here’s the twist: Sherman would sometimes shuffle around the number of likes that each photo had. No matter how she shifted the pattern of likes, the photos with more likes were always the most popular with the youths. So how can we counteract these negative side effects? Well, one technique is to ban technology completely, which is what Waldorf schools attempt to do. Before seventh grade, students at Waldorf schools aren’t exposed to technology at all. Oddly enough, this has made them particularly popular with Silicon Valley CEOs, who also tend to believe that technology hampers development. However, there’s another way to do things: give guidance and let children establish their own limits. This method certainly worked at Longacre Leadership Camp in Pennsylvania, where a staff member named Matt Smith conducted a daring experiment. Instead of following the lead of most summer camps and banning technology, Smith decided to allow it after the first week of camp. At first, technology use shot up – but after this initial surge, campers began enforcing their own limits. And they not only monitored themselves; they monitored each other. Campers would be called out for overusing their headphones, for instance, or for texting outside of quiet time. If we can guide them and set a good example, there’s no reason our children can’t form healthy relationships with technology. So how can you set a good example for others and form better technology habits? Why not start by taking on the Bored and Brilliant challenge? It’s a weeklong program that encourages better technology-usage habits, with a new mini challenge for each day of the week. Here’s what the first four days look like: Day one is about self-observation. Over the course of a normal day, take note of your digital habits. There are two apps that can help you do this: Moment, for iOS, and Space, for Android. Both will show you how many times you unlock your phone per day, and how much time you spend on the device. At this point, you just want to get an idea of your typical device usage, so there’s no need to alter your behavior yet. On day two, you should avoid using your device when you’re on the move. Whether you’re on a walk, on your commute or standing in an elevator, don’t give in to the urge to take out your phone. And don’t do it by halves – really don’t use it at all. No podcasts, no music, nothing. Leave your phone in your pocket or purse and observe the world around you. Day three is photo-free day, which is pretty straightforward: just don’t take any photos at all. This will both help you occupy the moment and make it easier for you to remember your experiences later. If this is too easy, try not to share or like photos, either. On day four, you should delete an app. You know the one – you overuse it, especially when you’ve got a down moment. And don’t cheat – really delete it. And it has to stay deleted. Once it’s gone, you’ll be free to enjoy all those moments that you used to waste! Beginning the challenge is the hardest part. But once you’ve done that, you can begin the second part of the challenge, which is all about creating healthier digital habits. Now that you’ve taken steps toward breaking your unhealthy digital habits, it’s time to form some new, positive ones. Once you’ve established these habits, you’ll be ready to tap into all your hidden reservoirs of creativity. It’s day five, which means it’s time for you to take a fakeation – that is, to designate a window of time during which you’ll be completely unplugged from all digital devices and distractions. You should use this time either to focus on a project you’ve been meaning to complete or simply to enjoy a bit of notification-free peace and quiet. Now determine how long this fake vacation needs to be, whether that’s half an hour or the whole day. Before unplugging, set up an auto-response message on your email, letting people know that you’re otherwise occupied and can’t respond immediately. Do this even if your break ends up being very short – and then do the same for the other channels through which people tend to contact you. On the next day, day six, your challenge is pretty simple. All you’ve got to do is go to a public space and spend a period of time watching and listening (without any digital devices, of course). If you don’t like the idea of lurking around one place, go take a long, aimless stroll. Pay attention to the buildings, the people, the sounds and smells. This won’t only calm your mind and excite your creativity; it may even open your eyes to something you’d have otherwise missed altogether. Day seven’s challenge brings together all the work you’ve put in so far. On this day, you should pinpoint an issue in your life that makes you feel anxious or confused. Once you’ve done this, spend 30 minutes alone, with no distractions and no interruptions. Then get a sheet of paper and fill the page with ones and zeros. Make the numbers as small as possible, so that it takes a while. Then, when all this mindless activity has made you terribly bored, you should grab a new sheet of paper and start writing possible solutions to the issue you identified earlier. If all goes well, your creativity will have been sufficiently stimulated by all this boredom and you’ll cook up a solution that you would never have thought of otherwise. Don’t think the Bored and Brilliant challenge will solve your problems overnight; it won’t. However, it should provide you with the tools necessary for improving your digital habits and your relationships to your devices. The key message in this book: Technology is incredibly helpful, but it can do a great deal of harm, too. By being mindful of how we interact with our devices, and by creating space to be bored, we can break the control that technology too often exerts. Furthermore, children need to be taught to use technology responsibly. This doesn’t mean keeping it from them; rather, it’s a matter of teaching them what healthy usage looks like. We can improve our own digital habits, and become better role models, by taking on the Bored and Brilliant challenge. Actionable advice Do some quick meditation.

For starters, we’re experiencing a first in human history: the need to create space, not fill space. For over a thousand generations, we’ve been exploring, expanding and filling up the vast space around us. But now we’re at a point where people are feeling overcrowded and overscheduled, and they need to create space to get some relief. This new development in human history was one reason the author felt compelled to write Create Space. The other was the realization that leaders must prepare a space for themselves to grow and develop, which means that creating space is a prerequisite for growth, improvement and development. With these two ideas in mind, Derek Draper went to work organizing all the ways creating space can help you develop a better life and career. Essentially, there are four domains: thinking, connecting, doing and being. And within each of these domains, there are ways to develop skills around reflection, self-awareness, relationships and productivity. In these blinks, you’ll find out how many minutes per day a CEO has for solitary concentration; why providing answers isn’t the best way to be a leader; and how reflecting on death can connect you to your purpose in life. If you want to be good at what you do, you need self-awareness. Knowing your own strengths and weaknesses is a fantastic advantage, whether you’re an artist, the CFO of a corporation or an administrative assistant. With self-awareness, you’ll be in a better position to avoid potential problems, create more effective plans and make better decisions. The key to knowing yourself is reflection, or what people sometimes call “having a meaningful conversation with oneself.” Since the days of Confucius and Socrates, great minds have been championing the intellectual benefits of reflection – but it comes with a host of practical benefits, too. For example, it can greatly boost your decision-making abilities and reduce mistakes. Before taking an action, you should take time to reflect on possible side effects and any alternative options. Then, after taking an action, you should analyze the results and identify what went right or what went wrong. Doing this regularly will guarantee that you’ll make fewer mistakes. But for deep and meaningful reflection to happen, you need space. In fact, you need four kinds of space: temporal, physical, relational and psychic. Temporal and physical space are time and location, respectively. Relational space refers to the benefit of having someone else to bounce ideas off of, and psychic space is about being open to improvement and feeding your mind new and enlightening information. Creating all this space takes effort. According to a study from Harvard University, CEOs typically have less than 15 percent of their workweek available for solitary work. And if CEOs can’t make space for reflection, it’s probably not much easier for the rest of the workforce. Even if you do find the space to reflect, it's not always an easy thing to do. Shutting out the numerous distractions that fill our days can be tough. More challenging still is the fact that reflection doesn’t always lead to pleasant realizations. Reflecting on past actions might lead you to discover that you behaved foolishly in the last managers meeting, or that you treated your assistant in an inconsiderate manner. Nevertheless, if you want the benefits of self-awareness, you need to acknowledge these unpleasant realities. And there are benefits of being more aware. Just consider a study of commuters in the United Kingdom, in which it was found that commuters who used their ride home to deliberately reflect on how their day went were happier and more productive than those who didn’t. So make the space to reflect! Staying open to learning goes hand in hand with having space to think. While reflection is often a way of learning about yourself, you also need to create space for learning by adopting the right mind-set, one that is receptive to growth and development. Generally speaking, everyone has one of two mind-sets – either a fixed mind-set, where you believe learning stops at some point since the brain can only hold a fixed amount of information, or a growth mind-set, where you believe you can always learn more. The fixed mind-set, though, has been scientifically debunked. Neuroscientist Dr. Michael Merzenich has shown that our brains are all “soft-wired” and capable of neuroplasticity. In other words, your brain is always changing based on the input you provide it. This means that a healthy brain is always capable of learning, allowing us to grow and change to overcome our fears. Take the fear of failure, for example. In one 2015 study, one-third of all Americans reported that they feared failure, with millennials being the most susceptible. But as widespread as fear of failure is, there’s a straightforward way to deal with it – incorporating failure into a growth mind-set and accepting it as a learning opportunity. One of the author’s clients, Rachel, worked for a global snack company. Rachel had such deep-seated fear of failure that she was prone to what’s known as catastrophic thinking – believing that if she made the slightest mistake, everything would fall apart and she’d end up destitute. The author worked with Rachel for weeks, providing space for her to reflect on the source of her fears so she could start learning to think differently. Together, they discovered that her fear of failure stemmed from her mother, who had been unemployed and homeless for some time. As a result, Rachel had the unconscious fear that any mistake, or even asking for help, could cause her to end up like her mother. Over time, Rachel learned to think differently and eventually came to see that asking for help isn’t a sign of failure. As with reflection, you must put in the effort to create a space for learning. This includes making time, as well as finding a good place and helpful resources, such as a mentor, for self-improvement. The second kind of space that’s necessary for success is space to connect. This is extremely helpful in building stronger relationships, of course. But forging such relationships won’t be possible until you establish a quality connection with yourself. Like creating a space to reflect, creating a space to connect with yourself is about looking within; this time, however, it’s about checking in to see what’s going on in both your body and your mind. This means observing your emotions. As human beings, all of us are subject to strong emotions, which can control our actions and decision-making if we’re not careful. But by creating a space to connect with yourself, you can routinely check in and make sure that you, and not your emotions, are in control. There are a number of ways to do this. One is to perform a feeling and number check-in. Here’s how to do that: Sitting comfortably, take some deep breaths and ask yourself, “How do I feel?” Once you recognize a feeling, rate it on a scale of one to ten based on how strong it is. You can then move to physical sensations, like tightness in your shoulders or chest, and give those a number as well. If you feel overwhelmed by a lot of competing emotions, imagine you’re an observer situated above it all, rather than the one caught up in the middle. Checking in is essentially a way of growing your emotional intelligence. The strength of someone’s emotional intelligence is reflected in how adept they are at controlling their own emotions, as well as maintaining relationships and being empathetic. Having the space to reflect and check in will help you grow your emotional intelligence and put you in a good position to recognize what the author calls your core pathogenic beliefs (CPBs). If your career is stuck in a rut, it may be due to a CPB. In the previous blink, Rachel’s CPB was that if she made a mistake or asked for help, her world would collapse. Other clients have had CPBs like “I am unworthy of receiving love,” “I am unworthy of giving an opinion” or “everyone is untrustworthy, so there’s no sense in being nice.” Many CPBs are the result of past experiences, often those from childhood. It takes effort to get to the bottom of these, and it definitely requires space to think and connect. Along with connecting to your own emotions, it’s important to connect with others. To do that, you need to create space for sharing and relating. This will allow you to build strong teams and meaningful relationships with everyone in your life. The author worked with a team that was routinely missing its targets for a global beverage company. The team leader, Beata, was cheerful and confident, but the team’s CPB soon became clear: they felt they always had to be nice in order to work well together. As a result, problems, concerns, mistakes and conflicts were kept quiet and left to fester, hurting the team’s ability to grow, develop and perform at its best. Once this was spotted and corrected, they became a team with space to share. This meant that they practiced transparency, with problems, concerns and mistakes being raised and resolved without fear of repercussion. This created an important sense of safety, where members felt free to take risks and sometimes fail, which is part of learning and growing. Needless to say, the team was soon on the right track with a renewed sense of purpose and vitality. Creating space to relate is another way to connect, and it’s extremely helpful in building strong relationships. In their book, Real: The Power of Authentic Relationships (2016), authors Duane and Catherine O’Kane share the results of their clinical studies that suggest all of our problems can be traced back to relational issues. Low levels of productivity and morale, high levels of stress, anxiety and depression – whatever the issue, it can always be linked to issues you have with other people in your life. Making space to relate and improving your relationships can help correct problems like these, and a stakeholder map is a great tool for identifying which relationships to start with. On a piece of paper, put yourself in the middle and draw lines to all the people in your life, from your partner and teammates to the security guard at work. Then rate the relationships on a scale of one to ten, with ten being extremely deep and strong. Every relationship doesn’t need to be a ten, but this map should show you which ones need to be worked on. It might feel like an awful lot of work, but the better your relationships are, the better you’ll feel, and the better you’ll be at leading. Some people find it exciting to be spontaneous, but when it comes to being productive, the first thing to consider is planning. If you don’t plan, you could end up like Red Technologies. Red was led by two brothers, Tom and Darren. Tom was the tech geek, while the charismatic Darren handled the business side of things. The company got off to a strong start but became messier and less coherent as it grew. A big part of the problem was Darren. He refused to set clear goals, so his staff were increasingly unsure of what they were supposed to prioritize. Meetings were held without agendas, and everyone deferred to Darren as he pulled solutions out of thin air before moving onto the next emergency. A lot of start-ups tend to balk at long-term plans, and it is wise to be flexible in a fast-changing marketplace. But there’s more than one kind of plan, and you can make flexibility a part of a one- to three-year plan by setting regular meetings to reassess your goals and vision for the company. To properly plan, you need to do two things. First, create a clear goal – what needs to be done. Then, create a clear plan for achieving that goal – how it should be done. When the author decided to write Create Space, he knew that he needed to write about 120,000 words. So he devised a strategy for making that happen by forming a year-long plan. That plan committed him to writing an average of 10,000 words per month, 2,500 words per week and 500 words every day. Being human, sometimes he came up short. Other times he exceeded his goals. What was important was that the plan kept him focused on delivering. Of course, being productive and actually delivering is different from simply being busy. Darren liked to constantly put out fires – “saving the day” instead of planning and being organized. This approach made him feel useful and needed, and it certainly kept him busy. But he wasn’t actually delivering. He was just reacting to the chaos that he himself had created. A lot is written about how distracted most people are these days. Studies show that CEOs only get around 28 minutes per day of uninterrupted work time and that the average worker has an eight-second attention span! What’s more, for every interruption, it takes ten minutes to return to your previous level of concentration. Clearly, distractions eat away at your space to deliver, so it’s crucial that you avoid them. But that is easier said than done. That’s because distractions aren’t just productivity-killers; they’re also a source of dopamine, the addictive neurochemical that your brain releases when you do something pleasurable. Receiving emails and text messages triggers little hits of dopamine, so it’s no wonder millennials are likely to open an incoming email within 90 seconds. But given how damaging a distracting email notification can be to your concentration, you’d be better off hiding your phone when you’re working and keeping those pop-up notifications out of sight. Then you can stay focused and in the zone, which is where the best work takes place. Open-space offices can also leave you vulnerable to distractions, so put on headphones or move yourself to a conference room or a café – wherever you’re able to remain focused on doing the work. One of the keys to productivity is knowing how to prioritize, and to do this well, it helps to have an organized to-do list because trying to keep everything in your head is bound to backfire at some point. One useful method for prioritizing is the 4D Rule, which stands for Do, Defer, Delegate or Drop. This starts with deciding which tasks qualify for the Do category – set the bar high for this and include only tasks that are essential, urgent and which can’t be done by someone else. Then, put the most difficult of these things first on your daily schedule, so you can’t procrastinate your way around them. Next, put items that can’t be done immediately on the Defer list, and anything that doesn’t need your personal touch on the Delegate list. Finally, anything that isn’t really essential is something you can simply Drop. Moving forward, don’t forget to check in with the items you’ve deferred and reclassify them as Do or Drop when you can. You can delegate them, too, but this can be tricky. Indeed, knowing the hows and whens of delegation is one of the hallmarks of a good leader, as you’ll see in the next blink. Next up is a rather unique space: the space to lead. It’s unique because it involves what is known as “the third space,” which is created when two people attempt to work together. When Yulia met the author for coaching, she had just been promoted to a CEO position that involved managing other leaders. While she was great at stepping into situations and doing what needed to be done, she tended to make a common mistake in how she treated the third space. Basically, Yulia would take over the space by providing the solution and leaving no room for the other person to be involved in solving the problem. While some people are grateful when a leader does this, it can be disempowering for those who want to learn and grow, since it gives the impression that their bosses don’t trust their abilities to rise to the occasion. A good leader always aims to inspire and empower, guiding others into the third space and letting them come up with solutions themselves. As the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, “A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.” In other words, leadership isn’t about you; it’s about them. So rather than coming to a situation intending to provide an answer, ask yourself: What questions will allow the other person to discover the right answers on their own? Another tool of empowerment is delegation. Yet, many well-meaning leaders feel guilty about delegating, as if they’re dumping hard work on someone else. They think they’re being nice by not delegating, but they could just as easily be conveying that they don’t trust a person to do a good job. Instead, you should think of delegation as a way to help people grow and develop their skills, and a sign that you trust them to do a good job. With this in mind, ask yourself what kinds of tasks will challenge them just enough to push the boundaries of their skills? And what sort of tasks align with their personal career goals? Finally, when assigning a task, remember to be clear in your expectations for what needs to be done and what the outcome should look like. Avoid telling them how to do it. You never know – they could come up with a much better way than yours! When you were in school, what did you love to do? Are you still doing those things now? If not, what happened? Asking yourself these questions is a big step toward creating space to be. When the author met Oscar, he was the CIO of a major bank – but he was also miserable, and the reason soon became clear. What Oscar really wanted to do with his life was to farm. His fondest memories were of growing up on his family’s farm and tending to the land and the animals. Unfortunately, the family had to sell their farm, and Oscar went to college and eventually ended up stuck inside an office all day. After his coaching with the author helped him reconnect with his true passion, Oscar tendered his resignation so quickly that it caused a minor emergency at the bank. But it was the right thing to do. Like Oscar, you, too, can create space to be. Start by looking within and being honest about why you’re doing what you’re doing. Many of us end up in jobs that are “sensible” or that meet someone else’s expectations. So many, in fact, that it’s one of the most common deathbed regrets. People regret they didn’t live life as they truly wanted, but as someone else expected them to live it. Keeping death in mind can help us avoid this kind of regret – after all, death is a fact of life, even if it is an unpleasant one. So ask yourself: if you had six months to live, what would you be doing? A lot of people assume that work has to be a hellish experience. But that’s not true. It might be difficult from time to time, but, in general, work should feel good and satisfying. If it doesn’t, you may be doing the wrong job or need to find a better work-life balance. Trevone, for example, assumed that work should be a chore that made you feel shitty. When he met the author, he’d just been hospitalized for exhaustion, panic attacks and depressive bouts. He thought the author would help him resume the lifestyle that had put him in the hospital. What he needed to do, though, was delegate, get more sleep and stop spending 80 percent of his life at work. Most overworked people will find that by working less and sleeping more, they’ll be setting themselves up for sustainable success by avoiding the kind of burnout Trevone experienced. The last space to be explored is the space to grow, which is about setting yourself up for your ideal future. Like many of the other areas, this space can be made by taking an honest look within and being open to some unpleasant realities. Growth, like life, is full of difficult choices. And choosing one thing always means saying no to something else. This is called an “opportunity cost,” and being aware of such costs is a vital part of creating room to grow. Take Almantas, for example. He had the opportunity to be closer to his mentor and position himself for his dream job, but it would mean relocating to a new country, where his wife would have to adjust to a very different culture and his kids would have to learn a new language. The opportunity cost seemed high. Fortunately, Almantas did get the position he was looking for, and his boss stuck with him through a bumpy transitional year. After that, he was crushing his quarterly targets, just as he had been in his old position. Things like relocating, taking pay cuts and having to go back to school are all common opportunity costs that can seem like a big burden. But they’re a small price to pay if they bring you closer to your dream and purpose in life. Finally, while you’re making your plans and setting your personal and career goals, it’s important to schedule regular No. 1 Meetings, which are meetings with yourself. No. 1 Meetings can provide a big benefit to your growth since they give you a chance to check in on your progress and consider any necessary changes. The author suggests weekly No. 1 Meetings, during which you should keep these three objectives in mind: setting a strategy, adopting a growth mind-set and raising productivity. The author recommends organizing your meeting around questions like: How is my strategy progressing? Are the goals realistic? Are there any resources that could help me stay on track? Are there distractions keeping me from meeting my goals, and how can I better avoid them? Remember, life is rarely perfect. Often, you have to be satisfied with good enough. So allow for mistakes and have faith that your hard work will pay off. The key message in these blinks: If you want to grow and be the best you can be, you need to make space for that growth to happen. This space needs to be focused on self-awareness, willingness to learn, interpersonal relationships, productivity, accountability and delivering consistently great work. Creating this space is hard work and requires honest reflection on your weaknesses and experiences that may be difficult to confront. But if anything is worth the trouble, it’s your self-improvement, finding your true purpose in life and making the most out of what little time you have. Actionable advice: Need to relax? Try square breathing. This technique is used by yoga practitioners, Navy SEALs and executives alike in order to calm down and focus. It's called square breathing since it's a four by four structure. As you breathe in, you count to four, then you hold on to that breath for four seconds. Then you breathe out for four seconds, and pause for four seconds before breathing in and starting the cycle over again. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

When this click of approval debuted in 2007, on the long-forgotten social feed aggregator FriendFeed, it was only a matter of time before it became a standard feature on every social media platform to come. After all, this simple feature, and the endless notifications it generates, is a great way to collect data on our preferences and behaviors, and to keep users hooked. It’s no wonder people are finally starting to push back against social media and recognize that these technologies may be doing more harm than good. Indeed, a steady output of research has been opening our eyes to the many negative effects related to social media and smartphones. In this book, professor Cal Newport conducted his own experiment. 1,600 volunteers followed his guidelines for a month-long technological sabbatical, providing him with valuable feedback. The result of this study is digital minimalism: a way to step back from the onslaught of digital distractions and find a more satisfying and rewarding way of life. In these blinks, you’ll find out how social media is like big tobacco; how the Amish can help you to better use your smartphone; and how your attention became more valuable than oil. In 2016, New York magazine ran an article by the popular writer Andrew Sullivan. In 7,000 words, the author described how the constant onslaught of news, images and online babble finally “broke” him. There’s a good chance you’re familiar with the symptoms of what Sullivan was writing about – the constant urge to take out your smartphone and check your texts, email or social media feeds, the strange dull sensation of a moment when you’re not using digital media. How did we end up here? One important thing to realize is that the technology at the center of this problem was never intended to be used in the way it is now. When the first smartphone, the iPhone, debuted in 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the device as “the best iPod ever.” It was a cool way for you to make phone calls and also listen to your music. According to Andy Grignon, an Apple engineer on the first iPhone project, Jobs dismissed the idea of the iPhone becoming a platform for third-party apps and gaming. As for Facebook, it’s well known that in 2004 Facebook was considered a clever novelty – a way to find out more about a friend of a friend – not a major source of news or even a popular time waster. For most college students in 2004, the computer strategy game Snood was far more popular than Facebook. So, when people first brought iPhones and Facebook into their lives, they weren’t signing up for something they would spend hours every day looking at. This dangerous and addictive side to technology is something that’s crept up on us, thanks to the very intentional work of social media engineers. In a 2017 episode of the HBO talk show Real Time, Bill Maher referred to the “social media tycoons” as being the new big tobacco, selling products designed to be as addictive as possible. Indeed, much has been written about the tactics used to get and keep our attention, including the way some tech companies take advantage of the natural human desire for social approval. One of the most significant developments took place in 2009 when Facebook introduced the thumbs up button, a variant of FriendFeed’s “like” button. Now, when someone posted something, it became a deeply interactive experience. How many people in my tribe would like what I posted? There was a primal urge to keep checking in and we have become finely attuned to the notification sounds accompanying these responses. If we hope to protect ourselves against the bright minds of Silicon Valley, eager to exploit our vulnerabilities, we need a strong defense. This is why the author, Cal Newport, proposes a lifestyle he calls digital minimalism. There are plenty of people recommending quick fixes like simply disabling the notifications on your smartphone, but Newport doesn’t trust these little adjustments to make much difference in the long run. After all, the author of one such article said he disabled the notifications on 112 apps, which begs the question, do you really need that many apps in the first place? Cue digital minimalism, which is about the time-honored philosophy that better living can come from less. The name is purposefully similar to the minimalist lifestyle promoted by people like author Marie Kondo, who propose only letting things into your life that bring joy. Newport is applying this to the apps and digital media you take in, suggesting that you ask: Does this website, app or service really support what I value in a way that nothing else can? Digital minimalism takes a further step in asking you to optimize this technology in a way to maximize the value while reducing the cost to your time and energy. So, if Twitter is something that your career clearly benefits from, you can use it wisely by setting purposeful rules around it that allow you to go in, do what needs to be done and get out. Tyler was one of the 1,600 people that signed up for the author’s experiment with digital minimalism. He’d signed up to a few social media platforms because he valued staying connected to friends, entertainment and networking. But following the principles of digital minimalism, he realized that the benefits of social media were actually small compared to the time it cost him. Tyler closed his social media accounts, and a year later, he’s still thrilled with the change digital minimalism has brought to his life. He’s getting more exercise, reading more books, volunteering and learning to play music. Even with all this, he has more time to spend with his family and feels more focused at work. Tyler knows people who say they can’t quit social media, but at this point, he can’t see any reason to continue using it. Digital minimalism is based on three principles – clutter is costly, optimization is important and intentionality is satisfying. The first principle relates to the New Economics famously promoted by Henry David Thoreau in his book Walden. Basically, New Economics includes life costs when calculating what something is really worth. For instance, if you want to buy a car to drive into town instead of walking, Thoreau would remind you that the price you pay for the car isn’t its only cost, it’s also the time, stress and effort it takes to earn this money and to keep the car secure and in working order. In the end, the cost may far exceed the healthy act of walking into town. This same scrutiny should go into every bit of digital media you let into your life. Ask yourself what you are really gaining from it, and what the time and attention costs are. Are you sure you can’t perform the same task in a different way? The second principle relates to another economic hallmark. That is, the Law of Diminishing Returns, which explains why you can’t just keep adding stuff and expect continued improvements. For example, if you’re manufacturing cars, the first workers you add will increase your output. But you’ll eventually reach a point when the assembly line can’t handle anymore strain. Workers are bumping into each other, and things begin to slow down. Let’s say, instead of making cars, you want to stay informed about current events. Going from zero to two news sites will be a big improvement. But if you’re cramming a social media feed with dozens of different sources, it’s bound to become a never-ending, incomprehensible distraction. Instead of adding sources, you need to optimize your tools. For example, maybe the Instapaper app would work better than social media. This app allows you to collect interesting pieces throughout the week and read them over the weekend, without any ads! For the third principle, let’s look at the Amish way of life. People often mistake the Amish for being anti-technology, but in reality, it’s not that simple. The Amish don’t reject technology without testing and questioning it first. Sometimes, as with a state-of-the-art milling machine, they’ll happily use it. However, if it doesn’t support their fundamental values of family and community, it’ll be banned. You should apply the same value-based approach to every tool you use. Does it really benefit and support your values and what you’re trying to do, or are you better off without it? If the principles of digital minimalism sound good, then the way to begin is to undergo thirty days of digital declutter. It’s important to recognize that this isn’t a digital detox period since a detox implies that you’ll return to your regular habits afterward. This period is about stopping what you’ve been doing in order to consider a new way forward. With this in mind, for thirty days, plan on cutting all non-essential technology from your life. This means anything that you don’t absolutely need to keep working and functioning on a day-to-day basis. At first, you might feel down when you realize how many addictive habits you’ve developed. But most of the people in Newport’s 1,600-person experiment reported that they soon forgot about their smartphone or whatever app they would reflexively open up. When identifying what is and isn’t essential, don’t confuse convenience for necessity. You may think you’ll irreparably damage a relationship if you quit Facebook. But you might find that without social media you’ll actually strengthen the relationship by calling the person, meeting them and speaking more often. The other task during this period is to look within and understand what’s really important to you. What are your interests, the things you value in life and enjoy doing outside of the world wide web? This is important because the next step is about finding something that will fill the void created by the absence of social media and new technology. After these thirty days, a carefully thought-out reintroduction period begins. This involves asking yourself three questions about any technology you’re considering keeping in your life. The first question is: Does this technology support something I deeply value? If so, move on to the second question: Is it the best way to support this value? Instagram may support the value of staying in touch with faraway relatives, but calling them on Skype every Sunday may be the far more meaningful way to do this. In fact, most people find that social media does not pass this screening process. But if something does pass the first two questions, it’s time for the final question: How can I use this tool in a way that maximizes its benefit and minimizes the harm it causes? A digital minimalist doesn’t just use or not use something. If they use Twitter, they probably don’t use it on their phone. They use it once or twice a week and only follow meaningful people they couldn’t otherwise connect with. The problem with a lot of “life hacks” and quick fixes is that they don’t set you up for sustainable change. They might prompt you to start a healthy new habit, but once you hit a snag or run into a problem, it’s all too easy to give up and say the fix didn’t stick. This is why digital minimalism has a variety of recommended practices that align with the lifestyle and are proven to have the kind of meaningful and rewarding value that is missing from a lot of digital-based activities. The first recommendation is solitude – a valuable commodity that new technology often takes away. If you were born before the mid-80s, you probably have clear memories of life before the smartphone. But people born between 1995 and 2012 essentially grew up with smartphones, and now spend an average of nine hours a day on these devices. World-renowned generational researcher Jean Twenge noticed a shocking uptick in psychological health issues with this group, dubbed the “iGen,” with a higher percentage of depression, suicide, eating disorders, homesickness and, above all, anxiety. Another term for what iGen is suffering from is solitude deprivation, a lack of time away from screens and input from outside sources, which is crucial for processing emotions, reflecting on relationships and what’s important in life, and giving the brain a chance to find some calm clarity. The silver lining is that solitude is easy to find. It can be experienced in a crowded cafe or subway train, just as long as you’re free to be with your thoughts and your thoughts alone. So the next time you go out, try leaving your phone at home. If you remember the days before smartphones, you know that this isn’t a dangerous or crazy thing to do. However, if you’re worried about an emergency, you can compromise by putting it in your glove compartment or somewhere where it isn’t readily accessible. Likewise, long walks are one classic source of solitude, with many of the great thinkers in history extolling its virtues. Thoreau was perhaps its greatest champion, but Arthur Rimbaud, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche also considered walking the inspiration for their best ideas. Of course, this is to be done without earbuds or a screen in sight. We’ve spent thousands of years developing a brain that has a complex network of neurons for the purpose of processing an intricate social life. It stands to reason that this brain would not be satisfied with emojis and hashtags. It may come as no surprise, then, that according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, the more time spent on social media, the more likely you are to feel lonely. So the next recommended digitally minimalist practice is to stop clicking “like.” In fact, don’t even leave any of those superficial comments like “so cool” or “love it.” Don’t fool yourself or anyone else into thinking these are meaningful human interactions or a valid alternative to a real conversation because they aren’t. Instead, stay silent and save your comments for the next time you call your friend or meet up with them for the kind of face-to-face conversation that we’re built to find satisfying. If you’re worried your friends will find this social media silence troubling, just tell them you’re stepping back from these kinds of interactions. And remember, if you visit a friend and bring some food with you, it will mean more than a hundred likes. The reality is that less social media equals a better social life. This is because you’ll be more prone to actually meet and talk to people. The same goes for texts, messaging and emails as well. An actual phone call is more rewarding to our social needs than any number of emojis. Of course, texts are extremely useful when you’re running late to a meeting or just need a quick confirmation. But when it becomes your standard means of communication, it can raise your level of loneliness. One Silicon Valley executive has come up with a pretty useful practice that you can start implementing, which is to set regular conversation hours. He tells everyone that any weekday at 5:30 p.m. you can call him and discuss anything. This is an effective way to discourage getting into a lengthy text-based back-and-forth, since he often writes back to say, let’s discuss this – just call any day at 5:30. This doesn’t just apply to phone calls, either. You can have a standing invitation to be joined at your favorite coffee shop on Saturday mornings at 11 AM, for instance. Whatever you prefer, just promote real conversations, and you’ll be happy you did. You shouldn’t underestimate the value of quality leisure time. As the legendary philosopher Aristotle pointed out, to live the good life, one must have the downtime needed for deep contemplation, for no other reason than to enjoy the activity itself. As Aristotle expert Kieran Setiya elaborates, activities that provide a “source of inward joy” are vital to a satisfying life. The author calls these activities high-quality leisure while calling digital distractions such as social media and absent-minded bingeing low-quality leisure. Therefore, one aim of digital minimalism is to make more room for the high-quality while purposefully limiting low-quality time. In looking at what exactly makes a high-quality activity, the author has found that hobbies requiring strenuous effort are often among the most rewarding. This may sound tiring at first, but as the influential British writer Arthur Bennett once noted, the more effort you put into your leisure activities, the more you’ll be rewarded with satisfaction and even come away feeling energized. Engaging physically with real, three-dimensional objects is also key, as Gary Rogowski points out in his book Craftsman. As such, poking your finger at a small screen is unlikely to ever be a truly satisfying or rewarding human endeavor. This is why one of the “leisure lessons” of digital minimalism is to engage with the physical world by applying skills and working to create things of value. And for this, technology can be a great aide. With the abundance of YouTube tutorials out there, you can easily spend a rewarding weekend either building your own wooden headboard or learning some basic techniques to become a weekend carpenter. You could also set leisure-time goals, like learning the guitar parts to five Beatles songs in time for a mini-concert at a friend’s Sunday barbeque in three weeks. Deadlines like this are great for keeping high-quality momentum going. To make sure you don’t succumb to the weekend-killing temptations of low-quality leisure, the best plan isn’t to go cold turkey, but rather to schedule these activities for specific times. Going cold turkey can easily backfire and result in a relapse of old behavioral patterns, so start by scheduling isolated chunks of low-quality time on evenings and weekends while you give the rest of your free-time over to high-quality activities. Chances are you’ll feel the difference in quality, and the digital distractions will gradually become less of a concern. With so many people glued to their smartphones and social media accounts, you may think of digital minimalism as an extreme and unusual idea. But the truth is, digital minimalism is just one part of a growing worldwide movement known as the Attention Resistance. This movement gets its name from the industry that many of today’s major tech businesses are in – the attention economy. Companies like Facebook make their money the same way tabloid newspapers did in the 1800s. They draw a big audience and then sell that audience’s attention to advertisers who pitch them their products and services. The more people they attract, and the longer they can keep their attention, the more money they get from advertisers. These days, getting attention is more valuable than getting oil, with Google valued at $800 billion, Facebook at $500 billion and ExxonMobile at $370 billion. With this much money at stake, companies in the attention economy are serious about exploiting human vulnerabilities and doing whatever it takes to keep you distracted. This is precisely why people have gotten serious about retaining their autonomy and resisting these tactics. One of the many effective methods used by the Attention Resistance is to dumb down your phone. So, if you see someone with a circa 2000 flip phone, this is likely a member of the Resistance who’s decided to remove themselves from the attention economy. Another method is to make your computer a single-purpose device, just like the earliest versions of Macs and PCs. You can do this by using popular blocking software like Freedom, which author Zadie Smith thanked by name in the acknowledgments of her 2012 bestseller NW. Now, some people think it’s heretical to revert your computer to a single-function machine like early versions of Macs and PCs as if you were purposefully making your computer less powerful. But whether you make your computer run programs simultaneously or not has nothing to do with its power. In fact, you could say you’re making it more powerful, since you’ll be more productive while using it as a single-purpose device! While the bright minds in Silicon Valley may have a lot of resources to gain your attention, with digital minimalism and the tools of a growing resistance, you can maintain your autonomy and stay focused on what really matters. The key message in these blinks: Digital minimalism is a way of life that attempts to respond to the emerging dangers of today’s digital media landscape. An increasing amount of data is contributing to two realities – that businesses in the attention economy are purposefully making their products addictive and that increased exposure to these products is detrimental to our health. It is only sensible that we reexamine our relationship to these services and our smartphones in general. By following the methods and principles of digital minimalism, we can reclaim our attention and gain an increased sense of satisfaction in life.    Actionable advice: Delete social media from your phone. When most people apply the screening process of digital minimalism to any social media platform, they find that the costs outweigh the benefits. But if you have good cause to maintain a presence on social media, it is then recommended that you at least delete the app from your phone and only engage with it through a web browser. Not having constant access to social media will already noticeably improve your life. By putting in this small amount of extra effort, many people either realize  that social media was not beneficial at all, or they become optimal users who spend as little time as they need, thereby gaining more time for high-quality pursuits.

Most of us find ourselves in that position far more often than we would like. When it comes to bringing our creativity to life, it can be almost impossible to get out of these ruts. So, what exactly is this inner resistance that stops us from achieving our goals, and where does it come from? These blinks offer the help you need to identify the causes of resistance and how it stops you from taking action. Explore various techniques to overcome resistance and get back on track, so you can finally make your dreams, ambitions and goals a reality. In these blinks, you’ll learn how aviator Charles Lindbergh was helped by his ignorance and arrogance; why your enemy in the struggle to get things done might be you; and why author Michael Crichton slept in hotels to save his marriage. Certain things help you move toward your goals, while others get in the way. Good music might motivate you to work out, for example, while your favorite television show might make you want to stay home. These are the allies and enemies in your life.  Ambition and self-awareness are the real keys to achieving any goal, but they’re always under threat by a common enemy: resistance.  Resistance manifests itself in a number of ways. When you’re working on something meaningful that you have real passion for, but find yourself bogged down by self-criticism and doubt, that’s resistance setting in.  Any activity that requires a lot of energy and time can draw resistance. Actually, the more important an activity is to you, the more you’ll have to fight the resistance that acts against it.  Acting was so important to Henry Fonda, for instance, that he would throw up every time before he went on stage – even when he was 75 and already one of the most famous actors in the world! Passion and dedication are strong allies, but they aren’t the only ones. Traits that we tend to perceive as negative – like ignorance and stubbornness – can be allies too, especially for artists and entrepreneurs. Such “negative” characteristics helped famous American aviator Charles Lindbergh accomplish extraordinary feats. He had no idea how difficult it would be to fly for 33 hours straight, but his ignorance and stubbornness, along with his arrogance, made him believe he could do it.  And he succeeded: Lindbergh was the first person in history to be in New York on one day and Paris the next.  Stubbornness also helps you stay dedicated to your work, especially in difficult times. Steve Jobs was notorious for being stubborn, and this was instrumental while guiding his company, Apple, from its modest beginnings to becoming one of the most successful technology companies in the world. Have you ever had a great idea, but failed to put it into practice because you spent so much time preparing for it? If so, you aren’t alone.  Let’s look at some strategies for avoiding this counterproductive habit.  Excessive preparation and overthinking prevent you from getting things done, so learn to resist them. Working is like meditation – you have to get into a mental state where you can assess your own thoughts and feelings objectively. If you start to feel self-doubt, learn to ignore it – that doubt is a form of resistance.  It’s better to act first and reflect on it later, especially when you’re starting a new project. Start focusing on doing work, not thinking about it.  So if you’re a writer, for example, action means putting words on the page, while reflection means evaluating what you’ve written the next day. Don’t try to do these two things at the same time; instead, create productive schedules and structures for yourself. One useful structure to apply is the three-act structure. In the three-act structure, you divide your idea into its beginning, middle and end. This basic structure can even be applied to the creation of the social media site Facebook. In the beginning, Facebook was a digital meeting space where anyone could create their own page. Its middle act was that each person could decide who is allowed to access the page, creating an interconnected web of contacts. Now, in its end phase, people can communicate and share anything they want through a worldwide community of friends.  So, when you’re ready to take on a big project, stop and ask yourself some basic questions. What is this project about? What is its theme? What’s missing? It’s normal to hit a block now and then when you’re working on something creative. Most of us lose confidence when this happens, but there are ways to overcome creative blocks.  When you hit a wall, stay calm and remember that it’s always possible to get past it. Recognize that there’s an enemy force that’s actively working against you and your dreams.  This enemy isn’t hidden within your boss, your children or your spouse – it’s inside you. It’s in your head and only you can defeat it, so don’t place blame on the outside world.  But remember that just because this enemy is inside you, it doesn’t mean that it is you. You haven’t done anything wrong yourself; it’s just resistance trying to block your true creative self.  You are a knight and your resistance is the dragon. To overcome this fierce and persistent creature, find your love for your work, and for what you have already created. When resistance appears, it forces you to ask two questions of yourself; only one answer to each of these will allow you to go on with your personal pursuit.  The first question is, how badly do you want this? If your answer is that you’re just in it for the money, fame or power, you simply won’t succeed. You must be completely committed to pushing yourself toward your goal, which is why the only answer to this question that will allow you to push on is “totally committed.”  The second question is, why do you want this? It’s alright if you want something just for the fun or beauty of it, but your answer should include something along the lines of, “because I have no choice.” Only this kind of profound dedication and determination will push you to do what you really want. At some point in your career, you’re almost certainly going to face the Big Crash, a major obstacle you have to overcome. Perhaps your computer suddenly crashes and takes your unfinished novel with it, or maybe a major problem in your personal life pushes you off track.  You can’t predict when a Big Crash will hit, but when it does, remember: it’s just another problem, and you can get through it.  Crashes can be extremely difficult and demanding, but they can be of benefit to you in the long run. A crash forces you to figure out what is and isn’t working in your project.  The author experienced this after he finished his book, The Profession, which had taken him two years to write. He gave it to his friends to read and, to his surprise, they hated it.  After several long conversations with colleagues, he was able to improve the book – but only after another year of hard work.  You may also experience a crash when you advance to a higher level in your work or creative pursuits, and realize that you’re about to cross a threshold. Much like a child taking his first steps away from his mother, each new attempt to do so will bring the courage to go further.  Like new advances, the fear of success is also a sort of crash. In fact, it lies at the very core of resistance itself – the fear of success is an enemy you will have to face.  But resistance is often strongest when you’re about to finish a project and have to push through it. Take bestselling author Michael Crichton as an example: whenever he was about to finish a novel, he would wake up earlier and earlier each morning to keep his creative momentum going, working around the clock until he was finished.  Sometimes he would even stay in a hotel because his increasingly erratic routine would drive his wife mad! The good news about overcoming struggles like this is that the more problems you overcome, the easier they’ll be to overcome in the future. Crashes ultimately help us become wiser and stronger. The key message in this book: Often we stop dead in our tracks just when we’re about to start achieving real success. Instead of just going for it, we can overthink our actions. Take the time you need to identify your enemies and allies along the path to your goal, and stay focused. Remember that challenges are just an opportunity to grow stronger; you can defeat resistance if you remain completely dedicated.  Actionable advice: Don’t let fear overcome you. Fear kills passion. When you feel the urge to abandon your work, take a step back and try to quiet the chattering in your mind. Focus on the joy and satisfaction your work brings you, rather than on the fear of failure. Conquering this fear is a major step toward always working with passion.  Suggested further reading: The War of Art by Steven Pressfield In The War of Art, author Steven Pressfield helps you identify your inner creative battles against fear and self-doubt and offers advice on how to win those battles. An inspirational book for anyone who’s had trouble realizing their passion, it offers an examination of those negative forces that keep you from realizing your dreams, and shows how you can defeat your fears to achieve your creative goals.

Perhaps you’re in charge of a team or a department, or maybe you’re convinced that you could be a leader, but aren’t sure which next steps to take? Well, in any of those cases, these blinks are for you. They explain what it takes to become an effective leader – that is, someone who achieves his or her goals and who excels at solving difficult problems, not by any means necessary, but by doing the right thing. They also explain how to become more efficient in doing the great work you already do so you can achieve the same results in less time and with less effort. There are twelve concrete measures that will help you achieve superb results; these blinks introduce you to nine of them. You’ll also discover about a top company that didn’t invest in a young start-up called “Google”; why sleep makes you a better leader; and what the medical term “triage” has to do with excellent time management. Being the leader of a company is like being the captain of a ship: It’s your job to get your company and its crew to the desired destination while steering clear of any iceberg-like disasters. And just as there are guidelines to help captains effectively navigate ships, there are simple practices that can help leaders stay on the path to success. The first practice is to set clear goals for your team that align with the overall mission of the company. With the right kinds of goals, you can do a number of important things. Goals give focus, and by focusing your team members you provide them with a sense of purpose. And purpose leads to productivity. A tangible goal is the engine driving your team. It gives meaning to their work. It allows them to see the big picture, which will motivate them to continue working even if they’re stuck with a difficult or boring task. In short, meaning will imbue your team with determination. But remember: make sure the goal is perfectly aligned with the company’s strategy. This alignment will prevent people from wasting time on projects that don’t advance the company in the right direction. This brings us to the next practice: communication. If you’re not clear and specific about what your team should be doing, there’s a good chance you’ll waste time and money on ineffective workers who are unsure about how they can be useful. One company was handling a job for a client who needed a specific spelling for a certain word. But due to a communication breakdown, the team was never told how important this request was and hundreds of copies of material had to be revised and reprinted. Obviously, you don’t want to end up in a situation like that. So, to practice good communication, remember these three things: Remind your team of what’s expected in a simple and straightforward way. Make sure everyone knows exactly how they’re contributing to the goal. And provide both written and verbal instructions to ensure there’s no misunderstanding. Change: some people love it and some people hate it. There are those who can’t wait to get their hands on the newest gadget and those who prefer to do things the old-fashioned way. But whatever your personal preference might be, as a leader, you need to be willing to adapt and change with the modern world if you hope to keep your company profitable. It’s a simple fact: As the world changes, the way people do business in your industry will change, too. If you look at today’s most successful companies, they’ve all adapted to globalization and the technological innovations associated with mobile computers and the internet. Inevitably, the companies that refuse change, and insist on playing by the same old rules, are doomed to fail. Imagine if a shipping company in the 1990s insisted that the internet was just a passing fad, and the company’s leader refused to start a website or use email. Do you think they’d still be around today? What people who fail to embrace change and innovation don’t realize is that they’re missing out on great opportunities. When Google first emerged, the shortsighted executives at Yahoo actually rejected an offer to invest in the young start-up, and you can bet that they’re still kicking themselves. By embracing new ideas, you can also attract new clients and keep your company looking fresh, modern and relevant. And when it comes time to implement a change or execute a decision, a leader must do this with confidence. It can be easy to get stuck procrastinating or hung up on details, so keep this in mind: Results are what matter most in business, and there are no results without action. And action, of course, requires a plan. So, once you have a good and thoughtful plan – and a policy for what to do if it doesn’t work out – act on it! Even if it turns out to be a dud, it’ll probably prove better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all. When you hear the word culture, you probably think about art and literature – or perhaps a biological sample. Yet there is such a thing as business culture; it refers to the social environment of a workplace, which is something every leader must tend with care. So another practice for successful leadership is to create an open work culture that allows your team to be as efficient as they can be. Some leaders are satisfied with having a team that puts in just enough effort to produce average work. The most successful leaders, however, will push and encourage their team to be the best they can be. If you push your team to work hard, you’ll get amazing results from those promising employees who get bored when they’re not being challenged. This is crucial, because a lack of inspiration anywhere in the team will spread like wildfire. All it takes is one bored person to damage the morale of the entire team. If you’re uncertain about how to properly motivate someone on the team, don’t be afraid to ask what kind of task he or she might find particularly challenging. Another tip that can increase efficiency is to reward team members who come up with ways to save time. Simplifying how your team can get things done and removing any obstacles that might be in the way is another important part of any leader’s job. A successful team is one that is able to perform at its best. It shouldn’t have to wrestle with outdated software, a slow internet connection or faulty computers and printers. So if your team needs new equipment or training in order to do a better job, it’s up to you, the leader, to spot this problem and fix it. Remember: The team is trying to reach the goal you’ve set. Any distractions or obstacles need to be removed. Also, keep an eye out for unnecessary paperwork or redundant procedures that might be slowing things down. Sometimes, the way things are being done can create problems. In the previous blinks, we touched briefly on motivation, but the importance of being a motivational leader can’t be understated. Motivation is what gets your team to be passionate about their work. It’s what will make them dedicated workers who can tackle the most difficult tasks. When your team is motivated, you’ll find there’s nothing they can’t do, whether it’s handling endless requests from the fussiest of clients or being creative enough to launch an app that makes learning calculus fun. So it’s the leader’s job to motivate their team and get them to care about the work they do. There are many ways to do this, but it’s especially important that each and every team member understands why their work is important so that they’re not just working for a paycheck. It’s also important to avoid micromanaging. Motivated employees need a sense of ownership, and they won’t feel that they own their work if you’re constantly telling them to do things your way. Micromanaging can also be an obstacle to action. You don’t want all your team members feeling like they need to get your permission before they do anything. Plus, don’t forget to celebrate the accomplishments your team makes. Instead of jumping from one goal to the next, throw a party when you meet a milestone or complete a big project! Another crucial part of leading a motivated and loyal team is to earn their respect. These days, it’s common for an employee to jump from one job to the next, hunting for the best-paid position at the most prestigious company. But this doesn’t mean that you can’t win the loyalty of a good employee. At the heart of a successful company is a feeling of mutual respect between the team and its leader. To establish this, you must first show them your respect, which you can do by regularly asking for their opinion and never dismissing their concerns. And to solidify their respect, always keep your promises and show solidarity by putting in just as much hard work as you ask of them. One of the most challenging aspects of being a leader is finding the time to manage your team without neglecting all the other work you have on your plate. This challenge is compounded by the fact that multitasking increases your chances of spending too much time on something that is ultimately unproductive. This is where prioritizing comes in. To sort out your work and make sure you’re doing what really needs to be done, adopt a triage mentality and rank your tasks by how important and productive they really are. Triage is more often used in a medical setting to make sure the sickest patients get treated first, but it applies perfectly to business as well. Just like sick patients, there are some tasks that need more urgent care than others, and there are certain projects that need to be dropped altogether. There are also disruptive activities that can seriously hurt your productivity, such as checking your email every few minutes. Every time your focus shifts to a new activity, you disrupt your workflow and waste time, because you then need to re-focus your attention back to the more important work. So be more efficient by de-prioritizing your email and setting specific times to visit your inbox. Another key practice is knowing when to cut off the amount of data you let in. You can spend a lifetime trying to educate yourself about a certain problem. This may feel like the only way to make an informed decision. But, in reality, our brain can only handle so much information before we become confused and distracted. So limit the time you spend gathering data and you’ll be more productive and make better decisions. Finally, don’t forget to take care of yourself. With so much going on, it can be easy to forget to prioritize your own health. Making decisions and solving problems can be just as tiring as physical labor. And mental overexertion can have some unpleasant side effects. People who are overworked and sleep deprived often feel burnt out, moody, sick and have trouble focusing. So remember to take breaks, have fun and get enough sleep. It’s not only good for your health; it’ll lead to being more productive and better leadership, too. The key message in this book: As an executive you are responsible for the environment in your company, and for the performance of your team. You are their leader, but you’ll find productivity only when you act like you’re a part of the team. That means establishing goals, being respectful and, perhaps most importantly, looking out for the team’s (and your own) well-being.  Actionable advice: Don’t overthink it. The next time you need to make an important decision and you’re torn between several options, don’t think too much. Simply compare the possible benefits and repercussions of every action, ask yourself what’s best for your team and business, listen to your gut – and act. What to read next: The Effective Executive, by Peter F. Drucker As we’ve just discovered, becoming a productive and effective leader isn’t easy. The steps outlined in these blinks will help you up your management game, but if you want to take your leadership skills even higher, you need to consult Peter F. Drucker, the ultimate authority in business leadership. In The Effective Executive – first published in 1967 – Drucker offers a step-by-step guide to becoming the best leader you can be. Millions of aspiring leaders, including Jeff Bezos, have benefitted from Drucker’s classic work, and you can too.

In this age of abundance, we feel like we need to have and do it all. However, this attitude runs headlong with an unfortunate fact: we can’t do it all. We can’t be an expert in every field, we can’t have every toy, nor can we have every possible experience. Not only that, but having and doing everything won’t necessarily make us more happy. In fact, we’ll find our closets cluttered with junk we never use and our schedules filled with tasks we can’t complete, at least not well. Instead, we should be focusing on what we should do, thinking instead about what is essential to our happiness and well-being. In these blinks you’ll learn all about how to identify the essential things in your life and what you can do to cut out everything else, thus giving you the mental and emotional fortitude to perform those most vital tasks to the highest standards possible. You’ll learn: why you should probably go ahead and throw away that stupid, howling-wolf shirt in your closet; what happens when airlines try to have it all and what sleep-deprived overachievers and drunks have in common. Our lives are so jam-packed with tasks and responsibilities that we struggle to identify which of them are the most important to us, that is, our priorities. Even if we make a concerted effort to go through all our tasks and pick out the ones we should prioritize, we still end up with too much on our hands. This overload of stuff massively hinders our productivity. Luckily, however, we can get our priorities straight by adopting essentialism. Essentialism focuses on four main points: Do less, but do it better. The cornerstone of essentialism is the never-ending task of identifying the less important things in your life to cut out, and doing what’s left over to a higher standard. Reject the notion that we should accomplish everything, and choose instead specific directions in which you can excel. Essentialism isn’t about making tiny progress in many directions. Instead, choose a direction and make great strides in the things that matter most to you. Constantly question yourself and update your plans accordingly. The process of deciding what’s worth doing and what should be let go is ongoing. The essentialist is always deciding whether what she is doing is actually worth her time or if she should invest her time and energy in a more productive area. Finally, once those few vital tasks have been distilled from the trivial many, the essentialist wastes no time in ensuring that the changes are put in place. While all that might seem easy, most of us are actually far from the mark. In the next few blinks you’ll discover how far away most of us are from the essentialist approach. Do you tend to say ‘’I have to” rather than “I choose to”? If so, then you are following the non-essential path. So many of us lose control of our ability to choose through learned helplessness, that is, becoming so used to the feeling of being overwhelmed that we approach our lives with passivity. To explain this a bit more, here’s an example: The term learned helplessness originates from experiments on dogs. In the experiments, the dogs were given electric shocks. Some of them were given a lever that would stop the shocks, others received a similar lever which had no effect and the last group received no shocks at all. Later, the dogs from all groups were put together in a huge box divided in two: one half administered shocks and the other emitted none. All the dogs from the earlier experiment who had the chance to stop the shock or had experienced no shock at all ran to the shock-free side. The ones whose levers were powerless, however, stayed in the shock zone and did not adapt. In other words, they had learned to be helpless. If we surrender our power to choose, we essentially give others permission to choose for us. When people think that their efforts are futile, they tend to respond in two ways: They either give up completely or become overly active, accepting every opportunity presented to them. At first, their activity might indicate that they have not developed learned helplessness. However, these people aren’t actually exercising their power to choose the opportunity which is best for them. They simply do everything. The ones who offer the possible choices, on the other hand, are the ones who hold the real power. If you had the power to travel back in time and build a fortune by investing in a company, which would you choose? IBM? Microsoft? Apple? While the success of those companies might make them an obvious pick for some, the biggest return on your investment would actually come from Southwest Airlines. In fact, Southwest Airlines displayed a remarkable level of success for a period by concentrating on one of the key tenets of essentialism: doing only a few vital things very well. Rather than offering their customers lots of choices, such as first class seating, meals and seat reservations, Southwest concentrated on one thing: flying people from point A to point B, and that’s it – no frills necessary. They realized that if they tried to do everything, they would undoubtedly fail. However, by concentrating on doing a few things very well, like getting travellers to their destinations, then they could be successful. Adopting this approach means being willing and able to make trade-offs, which can prove to be difficult. While it might seem simple enough to cut out unimportant tasks and leave only the most vital, in practice, we just end up becoming convinced that we can do it all. For example, when the success of Southwest became apparent, Continental Airlines decided to imitate their strategy. However, instead of cutting back to a few vital essentials, Continental erroneously decided that they could do it all. Their solution was to carry on with their traditional airline and create the separate brand, Continental Lite, to offer the budget service. However, the operational inefficiencies caused by pursuing both strategies meant that Continental Lite wasn’t price competitive. In the end, because they couldn’t sacrifice the nonessential and focus on what was vital, they lost millions. Now that you have a good idea of how far people often stray from the path of essentialism, the following blinks will show you what you can do to find the path again. Nowadays, hardly anyone has time to be bored. Modern technologies like our smartphones mean that we have access to a wealth of communication and entertainment. Since no one actually likes being bored, this sounds like a great thing. However, boredom can actually be good for you. A period of time in which you have nothing to do can give you an opportunity to think clearly about what needs to be done. In order to ensure that you have that time, clear a break in your schedule every day to give yourself time to escape: to think. Creating a space in your schedule just to think about your life – what options, problems or challenges you face – will help you assess which are vital and which aren’t. In fact, some of humanity’s greatest minds, such as Newton and Einstein, used this technique. Both of them confined themselves in solitude in order to escape, thus allowing themselves time to think about their groundbreaking theories. Many of today’s most successful CEOs do the same, scheduling a few hours of “blank space” in their calendar every day in order to do some thinking. However, escaping isn’t just a way to isolate vital tasks from the rest; you can also use it to ensure that you remain focused on the big picture. People often get so lost in the small, day-to-day tasks that they lose track of the reason they are doing those things in the first place. In order to maintain focus on what’s important, essentialism teaches us to always concentrate on the bigger picture. One way to do so is by keeping a journal, but instead of writing down everything you experience, force yourself to write as little as possible. This will require you to think through everything you’ve done and sift out only what you consider essential. And as you read back through your journal entries you will see the big picture emerge. Unfortunately, we adults tend to make a sharp distinction between work and play, having decided that play is something that is trivial and unproductive. It is there purely for entertainment, and doesn’t help us to advance our goals. In other words, it’s a waste of time. The essentialist, however, recognizes that play is a vital tool for inspiration. If you want to discover what’s vital in your life, you can use play to free your mind so that you can approach this subject creatively. Play can serve this purpose because: it helps us to develop novel connections between ideas that we would have never otherwise considered; it is an antidote to stress, which is one of the key factors in unproductivity and it helps us to prioritize and analyze tasks. We see the importance of play reflected in the culture of companies such as Twitter, Pixar and Google, who promote play by doing things like offering improv comedy classes or by decorating the office with a huge dinosaur or thousands of Star Wars figurines. Why do they do this? Because they know that a playful employee is an inspired and productive one. But as important as play is, it should never take priority over rest and sleep. Non-essentialists view sleep the same way they do play – as a luxury, a waste of potentially productive hours. This approach is totally backwards, as sleep increases your ability to think, connect ideas and maximize your productivity during your waking hours. One hour of sleep actually results in several more hours of higher productivity the following day! In fact, studies have shown that going 24 hours without sleep or getting a weekly average of just four to five hours of sleep per night causes a cognitive impairment equivalent to what you would have with a 0.1 percent blood alcohol level – enough to get your driver’s license suspended! Often, we fall into the trap of thinking that all of our tasks and responsibilities are vital in one way or another. Surely you’ve experienced something similar when you’re going through your closet during spring cleaning: you start with the mindset that “if I never wear it, it’s got to go,” yet, you soon find yourself making exceptions, and telling yourself things like: “I know I never wear this howling-wolf shirt, but I might want to one day!” So, you keep it and your closet remains as crammed as ever. So how can you avoid this trap? In short, be extreme with your criteria. One way to do so is by adopting the 90-percent rule. Start by considering the most important criterion for the decision you are making. For example, if you’re cleaning the closet, that criteria might be, “Will I ever wear this again?” Then, give it a score between zero and 100. With the 90-percent rule, anything that is less than 90 (even an 89) is a zero. After considering all the options, discard everything that scored less than 90. Another method is to decide that “if it isn’t a clear yes, then it’s a clear no.” A simple way to put this into action is to list the three minimum things that something must have in order to keep it, as well as three ideal criteria that you want it to meet. Then when deciding on what to keep, something must pass the three minimum requirements as well as at least two of the ideal ones. Thinking this way will hopefully allow you to avoid having trivial matters slip through. For example, there is absolutely no way that the howling-wolf shirt in your closet would pass the three minimum requirements: (1) “Is it stylish?” (2) “Would I wear it everyday?” (3) “Will no one laugh at me for wearing it?” So what do you do once you’ve made a list of everything that needs to go, that is, everything that is not essential to achieve your goals? It’s relatively easy to part with a shirt you never wear, but these decisions become more complicated when other people are involved. We tend to fear saying no, feeling both socially awkward as well as pressured not to disappoint the people around us, and are concerned that saying no might damage our relationships. However, often times we should say no, and reserve yes only for the things that really matter. To do so, you’ll need to separate the decision from the relationship. The pain of saying no may cause regret for ten minutes or so as you worry about someone else’s disappointment or that you’re missing out on something, but you might regret saying yes for way longer. Always remember, failing to say no to the things which aren’t vital can lead you to miss out on the opportunities that truly are. Once you’ve gotten used to saying no when it’s in your best interest, you can focus on planning the vital tasks that are left over. Be clear about your goals by having an essential intent: one main objective that is both inspirational and concrete. Imagine, for example, that your goal is to end world hunger. Although this goal is certainly inspirational, it’s not at all concrete, and thus fails as your essential intent. Trying to follow an objective of this magnitude will become cumbersome due to its vagueness. Now consider this goal: build 150 affordable, environmentally friendly, storm-resistant homes for families living in the lower ninth ward. Not only is this goal inspirational, but it’s also specific and concrete. In other words, your objective is abundantly clear. One way of checking whether your goal is clear is by asking yourself: How will I know when I’ve reached my goal? If you can reasonably answer this question, then you know you have clarity about what you are doing. Have you ever ended up doing something that you knew was a waste of effort simply because you committed to it? A lot of people fall into this sunk-cost bias. The sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue investing money, time, effort and/or energy into something we already know is unlikely to succeed. Unfortunately, every little investment makes it harder for us to let go, while simultaneously increasing the amount we are sure to lose. To illustrate this, consider the spectacular failure of the Concorde jet. Although it was an astonishing engineering achievement, the cost made it unprofitable and doomed to commercial failure. Regardless, the French and British governments fell into a sunk-cost bias, and continued investing in it for four decades, fully aware that most of their money would never be recuperated. You can easily avoid this trap by developing the courage to admit your errors and mistakes and let them go. If it’s clear that something isn’t going to work out, then don’t be afraid to cut your losses and abandon ship. Moreover, you can avoid this entire scenario by setting clear boundaries. While a non-essentialist sees boundaries as unnecessary constraints, boundaries are in fact liberating on a fundamental level. Imagine, for example, a schoolyard on a busy street: at this school, children are only allowed to play in a small part of the yard next to the school buildings, and the teachers have to keep a watchful eye that the children stay within this boundary. But what if a fence was installed that clearly demarcated where the children can safely be? Then the teachers could use their time better, since they wouldn’t have to be so concerned with children being near traffic, and the children could play freely within that space. Boundaries are not there to constrain you, but to make your life easier and more enjoyable. For example, you could consider setting a clear boundary between work and family. If your kids aren’t allowed in the office, then work shouldn’t be allowed in your home. Once you’ve committed to the principles of essentialism, it’s time to grapple with the last step: execution. Becoming an essentialist requires you to identify what’s slowing you down and then eliminate it, rather than simply finding ways to work around it. For example, imagine that you’re a boy scout leader and need to get your troop to camp before nightfall. In order to keep things fair, each scout is carrying equal provisions in his backpack. But, you’ve got a problem: some of the scouts are much faster than others, and thus the group spreads out and the kids in the back risk getting left behind. Your first (non-essential) solution is to make stops every so often so that the stragglers can catch up. Next, you try taking the kids from the back and putting them at the front so everyone stays together, but this just slows everyone down. Finally, you see the essentialist solution: you take some of the weight out of the slower kids’ backpacks and put it in the fast kids’ backpacks. By thinking with the principles of essentialism, you’ve eliminated the problem! In addition, you can prevent unnecessary obstacles by being prepared. One of our biggest mistakes is assuming that our plans will go as expected. An essentialist, however, does not think this way. Instead, he assumes that things might go wrong and thus makes the right preparations. Whatever you do, whether it’s taking your kids to school or delivering a presentation at work, always give yourself a buffer of 50 percent of the time you expect it to take. This way you can always leave room to correct anything that ends up slowing you down. If you’ve ever achieved something in one fell swoop, then you experienced luck first hand. Most of the time, it won’t work out that way. In reality, creating success is all about building upon your previous progress with small, incremental steps. Small wins create momentum, which gives you the confidence to further succeed. Moreover, they allow you to stay on track by giving you the opportunity to check whether you are heading in the right direction. While it might be frustrating to take small steps, remember that the consequences of even small steps can be far-reaching. Take the police department in Richmond, Canada, for example. For years they tried to lower the rate of recidivism by using sweeping measures, such as more stringent laws and stronger punishments, with poor results. Then they decided to totally reshape their reforms by taking small steps towards crime prevention: When police saw young people doing something good, like putting their trash in bins instead of throwing it on the street, they gave them a small reward, such as free tickets to movies and youth events. These measures helped keep the young people off the streets, and after a decade of this policy, the rate of recidivism dropped from 60 to only eight percent. But no matter what your approach, you’ll need to ensure that you stick with it by designing a routine. Routines create a habit, thus making difficult things become easier over time. It’s therefore prudent to create a routine that aligns with your goals. For example, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps’s coach got him to follow a routine during his training. Every time Phelps went to bed and as soon as he woke up in the morning, he had to visualize a slow-motion video of what he imagined to be the perfect race. Phelps then tried to replicate this video during training. Sure enough, he did this for so long that, when the Olympics came, his habits took over and swam the perfect race again and again, winning him a number of medals. The key message in this book: In spite of how it might seem, only a few things are actually vital to our goals and well-being, and everything else is unimportant. By focusing on these few essential things and learning to do better by doing less, we can craft a life that is far more productive and fulfilling. Actionable advice: Be an editor.  Rather than constantly adding more and more responsibilities and material possessions to your life, try instead to find ways to cut things out. The more trivial things you can eliminate from your thinking and routine, the better you’ll be at what’s left; the things that truly matter.

Pozen","summary":"People tend to think that increased productivity is going to be exhausting. They believe that they’ll have to work all the time, at full capacity, to fulfill their ambitions. But in fact the opposite is true. The more productive you are, the faster you can finish your work. That means more time to do the things that matter to you. And, as a consequence, you will be more happy and refreshed, which will make you even more productive. So how can we enter this positive cycle? It’s really all about simplicity. Productivity is about developing a certain Zen sense of busyness, expending minimal effort for maximum results. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to plan your work efficiently; how to stop losing time and find focus; and why you really can work less than eight hours a day. Planning ahead, whether it’s for next year, next month or even next week, can be a daunting task when you’re drowning in work. But looking down the line will pay off big time in the long run. To get yourself thinking more long-term, begin organizing your work. Split up tasks into aims, objectives and targets so that you can begin to prioritize. A good strategy is to divide tasks according to how long they take to accomplish. For instance, career aims take five years or more. These are things like expanding your business network or landing an executive-level promotion. Objectives take between three and 24 months. For example, if you work for a shoe company, an objective might be to re-brand a sneaker line. And finally, targets are anything that will take three months or less, such as writing progress reports or finishing part of a major project. Objectives and targets are both essential. After all, if you don’t focus on these baseline endeavors, you’ll never reach your larger career aims. But it’s also important to prioritize aims, objectives and targets that both you and your employer are on board with. You should first focus on the things that both you and your boss want to achieve; once that’s done, you can address the tasks that concern only you. For example, say you want to meet more people in your industry and also want to re-brand your firm’s sneaker line to boost profits. Since your employer also wants the second thing to happen, you would do best to focus on the re-branding first. Then, once you’ve parsed out your tasks, it’s time to set some top priorities, that is, the projects on which you’ll spend the majority of your time. To ensure you’re doing this effectively, you should track your work days, monitoring how you allocate your time. You might discover that you spend lots of time on activities that don’t have much to do with your objectives or targets. Maybe you’re going to too many internal meetings and failing to prioritize the important ones. How you allocate your time is crucial to your productivity, which leads us to another issue: procrastination. Have you ever found yourself with tons of work to do and no idea where to start? Situations like this can be paralyzing, so it’s essential to know how to deal with them. One approach is to break your projects down into smaller targets, for which you can set mini-deadlines. After all, if you’re like most people, you’ll only start working when the pressure begins to build. But instead of waiting until the last minute to churn out a sloppy piece of caffeine-fuelled work, a better approach is to set smaller deadlines that split tasks up into more manageable chunks. That way you can finish your work step-by-step, well ahead of its due date. When using this approach, you should set your deadlines at similar intervals and avoid having them all pile up at the end. For instance, say you have to write a 6,000-word report in four weeks. Your deadlines could be to write 2,000 words every week for the first three weeks and to spend the final week proofreading and adjusting. From there, you can hold yourself to your deadlines by sharing them with your boss, which adds some extra pressure and makes you more accountable. For instance, you could tell your boss that you’re working on an analysis of your company’s competitors and that you’ve split the task into four chapters. From there, you could say that you’re going to begin on Monday and that you’ll have the report in her mailbox by Friday. You could even make a calendar event that you invite your boss to so that she gets a reminder about the due date. Such an approach guarantees that you’ll deliver on your promises, since you won’t want to disappoint your boss. But remember, it’s also key to reward yourself after successfully meeting a deadline. So treat yourself to a nice meal or an interesting book to let yourself know you’ve done well. At one time or another, you’ve probably spent so much time on small, simple tasks that you never got around to completing the tasks that truly matter. That’s why, when doing work, it’s important to get the smaller pieces out of the way right off the bat. After all, spending too much time on a small, low-priority task will waste both your time and your patience. So instead of allocating a lot of time to work that’s not super important, do the simple things quickly to free up more time for the meatier tasks. For instance, each day you’ll be faced with different requests from your colleagues, your boss and your family. As these tasks come in, it’s important to decide as quickly as possible whether or not you’re going to handle them. If you are, it’s then up to you to do so hastily. A good approach here is to apply the OHIO principle, also known as “Only Handle it Once.” For example, say you receive an email inviting you to a conference. You quickly browse the email then set it aside. Three days later, you remember the message, but don’t remember the name of the sender. As a result, you spend countless minutes scrolling back through your inbox. From there, you’ve got to read it again, wasting yet more time! On the other hand, if you were using the OHIO principle, you’d check if the date was free and the topic interesting and make a decision straight away. Another way to move forward with your work, is to fight the temptation to be perfect when it comes to your low-priority tasks. Remember that not everything needs to be done flawlessly. You should reserve this privilege for your top-level work, since this is what your boss will see and judge. Nobody is going to be pleased if you spend loads of time answering meaningless emails, so handle such tasks accordingly: get through them quickly and move on to the important stuff. Anytime you read anything, whether it’s a novel or a blog post, you get a glimpse inside the mind of the author. Pretty quickly, you can ascertain whether that mind is neatly ordered or dramatically chaotic. And, if you yourself are a writer, your readers will learn much about the inner workings of your brain from the flow of your prose. So to improve the efficiency and quality of your writing, you need to add structure to the process. You can do this by brainstorming, categorizing and then outlining. In the brainstorm phase, write down whatever thoughts come to mind about the subject. Don’t worry about order and structure; paint in the broadest strokes possible. For instance, imagine you’ve been tasked with writing a pitch to your company’s executives about how to make the firm more environmentally friendly. You could begin by brainstorming things like company image, product package redesign, energy costs, carbon emissions and LED bulbs. From there comes the categorizing phase, during which you add some order to your ideas. Group your ideas into categories and then into subcategories. In the case of the environmental pitch, your categories might be intangible gains, such as company image and values; waste and energy, into which packaging and LEDs would fall; and profits and losses, which covers energy costs, carbon emissions and strategic positioning. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to outline your piece by arranging your categories in a logical sequence. In the above example the categories are already in the correct order and all you’ve got to do is write them out, adding an introduction and conclusion. But efficient writing isn’t just about structure. It also requires time and quiet. After all, how are you supposed to focus with your phone ringing, emails constantly flying into your inbox and colleagues pestering you? Try going to the office early, when nobody is around, or staying a bit later, after your coworkers have left. Or if your job involves traveling by train or plane, take this excellent opportunity to do some focused writing! Do you judge the quality of a book on how long it took the author to write it? Of course not. And the same is true of work. Results are what count. The number of hours spent on any given project is irrelevant. After all, can you think of a single customer or colleague that would want you to spend more time on something if that extra time led to worse results? For instance, say you write two reports. The first one, on which you spent eight hours, turns out bad because you started it late and were anxious while writing it. The second, which took you only three hours to write, is excellent because you prepared for it and knew just what to write. Which one do you think your boss will prefer? The point is, it’s totally irrational to value the number of hours you spend on something over the quality of the result. That being said, while working faster doesn’t mean you always leave the office early, it does mean should feel free to take some time off. It makes no sense to embrace a culture that favors long hours over productivity. Unfortunately, lots of managers still put more emphasis on hours worked than on results produced. They tend, often subconsciously, to value workers who put in overtime and weekend hours. As a result, many managers claim to favor results but in practice prefer employees who work long hours. Given what you now know about productivity, this is obviously a problem. However, it’s one that you can change by preventing such a culture from taking root. To do so, simply avoid making remarks that reinforce the importance of working long hours. For instance, if a colleague leaves early, don’t say things like, “Hey, banking hours?” And, if a coworker comes in late, avoid comments like, “Look who finally decided to show up!” By avoiding such snide remarks you’ll be improving your workplace culture. Of course, there are other benefits to cutting back on long hours. For one, it gives you more time for your private life, whether that means an outing with your family or getting some exercise. Most people just work and work and work, thinking that’s the most productive approach. But productivity is about much more than work. It’s also closely connected to your personal life and general lifestyle. After all, the point of being efficient at work is to make time for your life outside of work. It’s important to prioritize non-work related activities and to stick to the standards you set. This is essential for protecting your personal and family time. For instance, you could make a rule that you’ll always be home by a certain hour. If something urgent comes up that absolutely can’t be postponed, make a plan with your boss to finish it from home or come in early to finish it up. Remember, making sure you have time to spend with your family is essential, whether that means cooking together, sharing a conversation over dinner or, if you have kids, reading them a bedtime story. However you do it, it’s key to make sure that you’re there for the ones you love. But to make such a goal a reality, you need to show your boss that you’re reliable. Build trust with her and she’ll allow you to go home earlier or make up time another next day. If possible, learn to say no to late meetings. Simply postpone them, making a strong point that you need to go have dinner with your family. And in the best-case scenario, just take a job at a company with flexible working hours. A 2008 survey found that flexible hours are the single most important determining factor for employees when considering a job offer, which, as these blinks hopefully made clear, makes perfect sense. For instance, imagine your partner suddenly falls ill, or that your kid is in a play that starts at 5 p.m. You wouldn’t want to be stuck at work during such important times and, the truth is, you don’t have to be. The key message in this book: Productivity relies on efficiency. That means nothing will stop you from becoming a faster, smarter worker if you set clear goals and priorities. This results-driven approach will do away with procrastination, break up big projects and clearly define your working hours. Actionable advice Increase your productivity by reading faster. The key to reading faster isn’t to read more words per minute. It’s to read fewer words in total. To try this out just pick up a book on a topic that interests you. Read the introduction, then the conclusion and end by skimming the body for the information you want. You will almost certainly have gleaned the most important information you were looking for.

Or you’re ten weeks into your new three-month fitness program. But you just. Can’t. Finish. Are you lazy? Incompetent? Simply doomed? No. You just haven’t identified your true enemy yet: perfectionism. And that’s where these blinks come in. Here, you will learn all about perfectionism, how it stunts your progress and how you can push back against it to finally finish those long-overdue projects and bring your dreams that much closer to reality. You’ll also learn why perfectionism is like the cuckoo bird; how fear can make things fun; and why you should sometimes choose to be bad at stuff. We’ve all been there: you start an exciting new project, but somewhere along the line, it stalls and remains unfinished. Our excuses are always the same, as we’ll tell ourselves or others that “life just got in the way,” or “I was never able to get back on track.” But if we’re being truthful, a more accurate explanation is “I quit once it stopped being perfect,” because the real roadblock to finishing our projects is perfectionism. Any plan can be ruined by perfectionism. Once, the author, Jon Acuff, began a new year with an ambitious new exercise regime. It started off perfectly, with over 70 miles run in the months of February, March and April. But then came May, and he only completed eight miles, followed by June, with only three. With his excellent streak ruined, Acuff gave up. Acuff had the same thought a lot of us have: “If it’s not perfect, then it’s not worth doing.” But this is dangerous thinking, because nothing in life is perfect and no one should go around thinking everything will go their way. If we limit ourselves to perfect work, we’d never accomplish anything! Instead, it’s best to expect imperfection and understand that when it arrives, the real work begins. It’s normal for imperfection to arrive first thing on Monday morning. Before you even sit down at your desk, there may well be multiple problems that need fixing. How you deal with these imperfections, and how you proceed once they arrive, is what determines your success in meeting goals. In fact, it’s the actions on the day after something went wrong that separate the quitters from the achievers. Did you skip the gym and sleep in instead? Did your diet go out the window after you devoured a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts one afternoon? The day after imperfections like these are when you need to accept that life is messy, and push on with your goals. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that excellence can only be achieved through perfection when, in reality, perfectionism is the killer of excellence. Perfectionism isn’t the only roadblock to finishing; we also make things difficult by creating overly ambitious goals. When Jon Acuff was a college freshman, he dreamed of being a field-goal kicker for his college football team – this despite the fact that he was short, out of shape and had never kicked a field goal in his life. So it’s no surprise that Acuff failed to turn this dream into a reality. While this example might seem frivolous, most people do set goals that are unrealistic. Scientists refer to this excessively optimistic thinking as planning fallacy, and it’s the main reason current statistics say that 92 percent of us fail to achieve our goals. The concept of planning fallacy was pioneered by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. They found that people typically reveal a bias toward optimism by constantly underestimating how much time a task will take to complete. For example, one psychologist asked his students to predict how long it would take them to complete their thesis papers. On average, students estimated they would need 34 days to finish, but the reality was an average of 56 days – nearly double their estimates! A reliable way to avoid both planning fallacy and perfectionism is to cut your goal in half. This will greatly reduce the chance of quitting due to being overwhelmed or biting off more than you can chew. The author runs a “30 Days of Hustle” program, which is designed to help people set and achieve goals, and on the ninth day of the program, he asks everyone to cut their goals in half. By doing so, participants routinely find their performances go up by an average of 63 percent, and 90 percent of the participants report feeling more motivated, since their goal suddenly feels more attainable. So with this technique alone, you can stop falling short and start finishing what you’ve started. No one enjoys producing bad work, but sometimes letting yourself be lousy at one thing allows you to finish more important work. In the author’s case it was his front yard, which was an unruly, overgrown mess that was being taken over by weeds. He could have taken on the chore of cleaning it up and making it look good, but it would have required a lot of time and effort, two things he needed to reserve for his kids. This brings us to the next pitfall of productivity: thinking that we need to be great at everything, when in fact it’s beneficial to be bad at some things. While Acuff was bad at gardening, he could rest easy in knowing he was being a good dad. Our optimistic and perfectionist streaks will try to convince us that every single task and chore can be taken care of, without a problem. But this is just another way of setting unrealistic goals. Instead, you need to practice strategic incompetence; admit that you don’t have time to do everything and let things go, or give it the minimum amount of effort required. While Acuff was finishing his new book, he had to use strategic incompetence when answering his e-mails. There was no way he could answer them all and finish the book, so he decided to limit himself to dealing with 10 percent of his inbox. Obviously, there are some chores we can’t ignore, but many of these can be simplified such that they don’t interfere with the more important stuff. One of the author’s friends is Lisa, a goal-oriented mom who gets a lot done by simplifying chores like doing the laundry. Sometimes, getting the clothes washed and dried is enough, and her family have to get by with wrinkly clothes, since there just isn’t enough time for ironing and folding. Luckily, there’s plenty of help these days with simplifying, as apps and online services can help us take care of things like shopping and banking. When you think of the word “goal,” do you associate it with enjoyment? Or do words like, “pain,” “discipline” and “grind” sound more appropriate? You would certainly be better off enjoying the work you do, since you’re more likely to achieve your goals if they involve something you like doing. This is something many people discover when they take on a goal like exercising more. They might start jogging for a couple weeks, but will then quit because they never asked themselves, “Do I enjoy running?” This kind of question is extremely important, as researchers have found that the two decisive factors in setting a goal are satisfaction and performance success. These refer to how satisfying you find the work itself, and what it is you’re actually achieving. So, when your ultimate goal and the work it requires are two things you really enjoy, you have a recipe for success. During his “30 Days of Hustle” programs, the author found that when participants had a goal involving work they found satisfying, their performance went up by an average of 31 percent. And when they chose an enjoyable goal, this increased their performance by another 46 percent! Another way to look at this is through a simple equation: fun = success. We don’t always get to pick our goals, but we can often turn them into work that is fun. Let’s say a person’s goal is to lose weight. Now, a goal like this can either be motivated by fear, which isn’t fun, or reward, which can certainly be fun. You can think up prizes to add at the end of every week when short-term goals are reached, like taking a long lunch on Friday and going to see a movie. Deadlines can also be turned into a fun motivator. A lot of people dread deadlines, but they also provide a certain rush. So, instead of one monthly or weekly deadline, you can set up multiple deadlines every day to get that recurring thrill that keeps you going. Are you familiar with the deceptive tricks of the cuckoo bird? It’s a unique bird in that it manages to lay its eggs in the nests of other species, tricking the other birds into feeding and raising its young. This is very similar to the deception that perfectionism plays as it nests in our minds and tricks us into thinking things that aren’t true. One of the biggest lies related to perfectionism is that perfection is attainable if we follow certain rules. Now, these rules can vary from person to person, and they can make it impossible for people to finish their projects, so it’s helpful to figure out your own perfectionist rule. A couple of the author’s classic perfectionist rules are, “If something is easy, it can’t be worth doing,” and “If it’s not successful in ten days, it’s a failure.” He identified this second rule in 2008, after he experienced some early success in writing a blog. The immediacy of the positive feedback made him think that if good results didn’t come within ten days, a project was a failure. Not surprisingly, this rule made him quit a number of projects far too early. Often, we aren’t conscious about how we follow these rules, but they can be identified if we stop and question our motivations. When the author was speaking with a woman trying to lose weight, she thought her perfectionist rule was to get down to a particular number on the scale; if she didn’t hit this number, she wasn’t successful. The woman believed that since this unrealistic goal had become her primary motivation, she was having problems reaching her goal. But then she asked herself the one question everyone should ask themselves: “What do I really want?” Once she did this, she realized that her real motivation had nothing to do with attaining the perfect weight; rather, behind her desire to lose weight was a will to be healthy and avoid heart disease and diabetes. Upon making this realization, she could finally take the focus away from perfectionism and start getting good results. It’s not a coincidence that “cuckoo” is synonymous with “crazy;” these perfectionist rules will drive you nuts if you let them. Let’s say you’ve begun work on a new project and you’ve done everything right so far. You’re doing something you enjoy and find satisfying, you’ve accepted the imperfections, you’ve cut your goals in half and have overcome your perfectionist rules. If you’ve gotten this far, you might think it’s smooth sailing from here, right? Not so fast. Perfectionism will strike once more, on the day before done. One of the tricks of perfectionism is to think ahead to “what-if” scenarios, and as the finish line draws near, these thoughts can turn to fears that will cause you to stumble right before the end. If you’re writing a book, you might be nearing the end and start thinking, “What if the critics hate it? What if no one buys it?” The easiest way to avoid frightening scenarios is to just ditch the work and start something else. After all, critics can’t criticize something that is never published! But if you do this, you’re bound to be bitter and hard on yourself for giving in to your fears. As the legendary author Stephen King once said, “People are extremely hard to live with when they have a talent they aren’t able to use.” So, instead of playing “what-if” games, see what happens – and don’t waste time and energy worrying about things that haven’t happened yet. You should also be honest with yourself about the reasons you have for dragging your feet on finally finishing a project. People can get comfortable when others see them as a martyr, selflessly putting their dreams on hold to care for their kids or someone else in their family. Be honest about your motivations, and if this kind of situation applies to you, it’s probably time to reassess your fears and rewards, so that you can give yourself that final push to finish. Remember, no external praise will compare to the personal joy and satisfaction you’ll get when you follow through and keep the promises you’ve made to yourself. The key message in this book: The main stumbling block that people encounter when they try to finish their projects is not laziness, but perfectionism. Perfectionism convinces us that anything less than perfect is a failure, and the only worthwhile goals are one that are grand and difficult – and make you miserable. If we accept that nothing will ever be perfect, we can start to enjoy the rewards of productivity and accomplishment. Actionable advice: Celebrate your imperfect progress by using data. Perfectionism constantly tells us that we’re failing as we progress toward our goal. You can combat this feeling by measuring your actual progress, instead of just relying on that vague voice of doubt in your head.

We’re forever trying to fit more into our already busy schedules. That’s why we crave – you guessed it – more productivity. But how far can we stretch ourselves and our schedules? Michael Hyatt shows us an alternative to this path to self-destruction. In Free to Focus, he argues that we’re aiming for the wrong target – we don’t need to be doing more, just more of the right thing. This is easier said than done, especially in a workplace teeming with distractions that sap our attention and ability to focus. But Hyatt explains that if we can get a handle on these things, our productivity will soar and we’ll leave work feeling calm and content. In these blinks, you’ll find out that time is a zero-sum game; why getting more sleep means getting more done; and what to do in a “distraction economy.” Workdays are filled with an endless litany of tasks – there are meetings to attend, presentations to give, reports to write and projects to complete. But our efforts are seldom enough. Sometimes it feels like we’re in a leaky boat, frantically bucketing water over the side. The water builds up, and we start to sink. That’s the moment we start buying into the myth of productivity. We think if we could work a bit faster, we’d be okay. We start to look for life hacks, each promising to give us a few more minutes of time. But obsessing over speed actually decreases our productivity. That’s because we try to do more with our time, and squander any time saved by cramming more things into our overflowing schedules. Finding a quicker way to write our daily emails, for instance, just means we’ll start preparing tomorrow’s emails sooner. In another flawed approach to increasing productivity, we start working overtime to finish all our tasks. Sometimes we justify this by telling ourselves the overtime is temporary and things will calm down soon. However, the opposite is true. Jack Nevison, the founder of New Leaf Project Management, compiled the results of several major studies looking into workplace productivity. He found that workers who clock more than 55 hours per week are actually less productive than those working 50 or less, due to stress and mental fatigue. Our current myths about productivity are unsustainable and inefficient. That’s why, instead of productivity, we should start aiming for freedom.  Freedom can mean many things. The freedom to focus, for example, which means finding the time to focus and accomplish uninterrupted deep work. This is the most important and often most difficult type of work, as it yields more results and involves tough mental labor. Because deep work involves intense focus, it’s draining and is only possible for a limited time each day. This makes another objective of productivity even more important – that is, the freedom to do nothing. It sounds counterintuitive, but most of our breakthrough ideas actually happen when our minds are at ease. Being productive during the week means we gain the freedom to do nothing in our time off, and that’s when the creative juices really begin to flow. When our calendar starts to overflow and our to-do lists become longer than shopping lists, we instinctively cut down on recreation and relaxation. For most of us, busy periods mean canceling dinner with a friend or getting a few less hours of sleep. But not only does skimping on rest and leisure damage our emotional health, it’s also completely ineffective. Many of us believe that time is flexible and our energy levels remain unchanged throughout the day – we think we can extend our workday by 20 percent and accomplish 20 percent more. But time is fixed, and energy levels are finite. We usually get our best work done in the morning, when our minds are fresh, while after lunch we’re slower and less productive. This is daily proof that energy levels are flexible, and focus and willpower are finite resources that must be replenished. Here’s another principle of productivity that seems paradoxical: if we want to maximize our focus and become more efficient, we can’t skimp on rejuvenation. It reinvigorates our tired brains and energizes our bodies. The most important – and often ignored – form of rejuvenation is sleep. This is the very foundation of productivity. In his book Dreamland, David K. Randall states that sleep deprivation makes it harder to solve problems, stay focused and make good decisions. Likewise, the neuroscientist Penelope A. Lewis argues in The Secret World of Sleep that sleep-deprived people have far fewer original ideas. Our social lives are another casualty in our endless march toward productivity. Humans are innately social creatures, and intimate relationships are essential for our emotional wellbeing. Some of our most important relationships are those we have with our family, and neglecting these for work is a terrible idea. If our personal relationships deteriorate, our energy, motivation and mental health suffer – and this affects our productivity. Finally, don’t underestimate the power of play. Play refers to any recreational activity undertaken for the pure joy of it. This includes hiking, painting, fishing or just taking the kids to the park. These outings may seem inefficient – after all, playing means you’re not working toward your looming deadline – but they are actually a powerful productivity tool. Play is one of the best ways to recharge your mental batteries and launch into your work with a new, laser-sharp focus. Clearly, productivity should give you more time for rejuvenation, making you more focused and efficient – but how can you achieve this? The first step involves acting like a gardener. To save time, you need to prune away the nonessential tasks in your workday. Doing less to be more productive may seem strange, but it’s the most important secret to efficiency. Productivity isn’t about doing more of everything – it’s about doing more of the right things. This means identifying key tasks to focus on and trimming away everything else. You can identify candidates for elimination by assessing your passion and proficiency for each task. Passion refers to the high level of motivation that you bring to certain tasks. Proficiency, on the other hand, means that you’re skilled at the task and that this task significantly contributes to your work. By evaluating your passion and proficiency for each task, you’ll find the best ones to cut out – those tasks that score low on both passion and proficiency. Perhaps ordering office supplies bores you, and you always get it wrong anyway. If you’re in a management position, you might start delegating this to employees. Tasks that you’re proficient in but have no passion for can also be pruned. For example, though you might handle your team’s quarterly budget successfully, perhaps staring at numbers makes you sleepy for the rest of the day. If you’re self-employed, a clear solution would be to hire an accountant or CFO. Tasks that you’re passionate about, but not particularly proficient in, are trickier. These are easy distractions, but low proficiency means that you’re not adding value to your company by doing them yourself. If you love web design but aren’t very experienced with it, you could easily find yourself getting bogged down creating new pages when a dedicated web developer could create them for you far more quickly. Spending your time on tasks you’re both passionate about and proficient in is the most enjoyable and high-value way to spend your time. By making tasks with high passion-proficiency scores your guiding professional light, and cutting away everything else, you’ll be more productive than you ever knew you could be. Today, it’s easy to be overworked and overcommitted – the hard part is having the discipline to prioritize. How is it that some people manage to accomplish so much more than others in the same amount of time? One reason is that highly productive people understand the power of no.  Productivity superstars can say no, both to unnecessary tasks, as we saw in the last blink, and to requests from their colleagues and clients. They know that if they allowed them to, these tasks and requests could take up all their time and energy and prevent them from focusing on truly important work. Saying no like this becomes far easier when you understand that time is a zero-sum game. You can’t add a few extra hours to the day, or find spare time like loose change in the sofa. Remember – there are only 168 hours each week! For yea-sayers who struggle with no, remember that there is one lurking behind every yes. If you agree to meet for breakfast at 07:00 a.m., you’re saying no to your morning run. Saying yes to working overtime means saying no to dinner with your partner. Bear this in mind when someone next asks something of you, and be strict with yourself. If someone asks you to proofread their report this evening, but you were planning on working out, simply say that you have an appointment later. This is entirely true – you have an appointment with yourself. Rituals are another tool that can help protect your time and maximize productivity. This means establishing small routines throughout your week that structure your behavior. One of the best things about rituals is that they give you clarity for the day ahead or closure on the day behind you. In the morning, this clarity translates into work that targets your crucial goals. In the evening, the sense of closure will leave you content and help you rejuvenate, ready for a productive day tomorrow. Rituals are also extremely useful – once established, they’re huge timesavers and take very little willpower to execute. Two great rituals are the morning ritual and the workday startup ritual. The finer points will vary from person to person, but a morning ritual can include things like making coffee, meditating, journaling and reviewing the upcoming day’s goals. Likewise, a workday startup ritual can include catching up with emails, reviewing your schedule and informing colleagues of the hours when you’ll be unreachable today. As we’ll see in the next blink, rituals aren’t the only way to structure your working life. How many of us walk into the office with no plan in place, passively reacting to the day’s developments? But this behavior is setting us up to fail. The author Robin Sharma once wrote, “you will never be able to hit a target that you cannot see.” This makes a lot of sense – what’s the point of being productive if our actions are unstructured and we’re not aiming for anything specific? For productivity to have meaning and for focus to have an outlet, we need direction. Therefore, it’s essential that we plan our day beforehand. This clearly sets our target and gives us something to aim for. We can do this by planning our day around a big three – three tasks that we must accomplish that day. These are our priorities, and anything else achieved is a bonus. Three might seem like a small number, but we can choose complex tasks. The advantage of this system is that it forces us to prioritize our objectives. Another great way to supercharge productivity is by having an ideal week mapped out. Start with a blank week planner and design your perfect week. Don’t do this when you have existing appointments, like the dentist or a meeting – this is an ideal week! For example, you might want to schedule all your appointments for Mondays so that they don’t interrupt the rest of your week. You could devote Fridays to working on team projects and dealing with clients, and schedule in a couple of hours overtime on Wednesdays to catch up with any backlog. Be sure to schedule in plenty of time for rejuvenation! Perhaps you’d like to go to a yoga class on Thursday evenings and hike on Saturdays. When planning our ideal week, we should also plan our days. You might want to spend the time from 07:00 a.m. to 08:00 a.m. every day learning a new skill like a language, or take an hour at 01:00 p.m. to catch up with your team. Obviously, our ideal week won’t be achievable every week – we’re constantly pitched curveballs, and issues arise that disrupt our rhythm – but that’s okay. Life isn’t perfect. When we have a clear picture in our mind of an ideal week, we gain a new sense of purpose, a target to aim for and a sense of satisfaction when we hit it. Instant messaging, push notifications, web surfing and the endless scroll of social media – these things are embedded into our daily lives, and all conspire to rob us of our focus and concentration. And while many of them have brought considerable benefits to our personal and professional lives, they’ve also made it easier than ever to procrastinate. In fact, we can view the instant gratification culture that technology has fostered as a new type of economy – the distraction economy. Things like phone calls, emails, social media and news sites are all competing for our attention, and this is a valuable commodity – that’s why we call it paying attention! But these diversions, hidden behind a mask of speed and convenience, have made it harder than ever to focus and conduct deep work. We start to write out a weekly report, pause to check Facebook and suddenly find ourselves checking the news and refilling our coffee mugs. When we return, we’ve interrupted our train of thought, and we have to work to get back in the zone. For example, a study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, found that once interrupted, it takes an office worker an average of 23 minutes to return to her original task. If you’re interrupted five times a day, that’s over two hours of wasted time! So, what can we do to retain our focus and concentration for longer periods? The key to fighting the distraction economy is to make it easier to stay focused. Start by checking your emails only twice a day, in the morning and after lunch, and make good use of your phone’s “do not disturb” mode when you need to complete deep work. If you want to take things further, try a focus application. These are computer programs that let you customize what software and websites you can access during certain periods of the day. Finally, take control of your workspace. One 2011 study by Princeton University found that, because of the visual stimuli, a cluttered environment significantly reduces your ability to process information. So, simplify and organize your desk, your wider office space and your digital files. The distraction economy is hard to get a handle on, but once we realize how damaging it can be to productivity and take steps to limit its impact, we'll be free to focus. The key message in these blinks: Productivity isn’t about saving a few minutes on each task and using that time to blindly take on more work. We need to be smarter about which tasks we choose to focus on, ensuring that these are high-value jobs that most benefit our business. If we are more discerning about what we undertake and combine this with high-quality rest and recovery, we set ourselves up for a highly productive day – as long as we can negotiate the minefield of the distraction economy. Actionable advice: Create a not-to-do list. As we’ve seen, the secret to enhanced productivity is not doing more, but doing more of the right things. And for productivity-minded individuals, the hardest part often comes when trying to decide which tasks and responsibilities to eliminate from their weekly schedule. To tackle this challenge, consider creating a not-to-do list. For example, don’t want to waste time dealing with issues outside your department? Put these on your not-to-do list, and stick to that. This will help shift your attitude away from a damaging “take on everything” mindset. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You have lost half of your staff, several of your factory buildings have been destroyed and supplies are scarce.  How do you manage? That’s exactly the situation many Japanese industrialists faced after the World War II – and manage they did. In fact, they found a way to elicit superb results with minimal resources, and Japanese industry experienced a meteoric rise as a result. As a manager, you’ll always want to achieve more with less. Luckily, it’s possible right now, anywhere, without an expensive upgrade in technology.  Many Western companies already emulate the thrifty Japanese modes of production, and thrive while doing so. So what’s the secret? In these blinks, you’ll learn about one of these techniques: Gemba Kaizen. You’ll find out how to analyze your work protocols, cut out anything that’s not necessary and involve all your employees in the process.  You’ll also learn how red tape can help you become more productive; how to get to the bottom of every problem with just five questions; and why it can actually be a good sign if a manager is not in her office all that often. So, you want your company to become more productive. Perhaps you’ll hire a specialized consultant, or invest in some new equipment. But increased productivity isn’t necessarily achieved by adding more. In fact, it’s often quite the opposite.  The Gemba Kaizen strategy guides you to greater productivity through elimination. When we analyze working processes, we often find several elements that consume time and energy without contributing anything to the end product.  These wasteful elements are called muda. By eliminating muda, we can free up resources, which in turn can be put to more effective use. For instance, muda could be overproduction, or the waiting time created by inefficient transportation. Even the time you spend walking from A to B is muda! In fact, the notion that walking is wasteful sparked radical improvements in a US hospital. Through clever design, the distances staff had to walk were reduced by several miles. Employees subsequently completed 100 percent of their tasks in half the time! Employees don’t just benefit from Gemba Kaizen efficiency – they’re also responsible for creating and implementing strategies. Employees, not managers, are in charge of the day-to-day work that presents the most opportunities for improvement.  That’s why Gemba Kaizen regards employees as the real experts. With employees playing the central role in boosting your company’s productivity, there’s no need for an external consultant or costly innovations. Instead, Gemba Kaizen expects every employee and every manager in a company to stay on the lookout for possible ways to improve working processes. Most people who hear “Gemba Kaizen” or “lean business” think about conveyor belts, car manufacturing and the like. But that’s only part of the story. Let’s look at the beginnings of Gemba Kaizen, when it emerged as the only strategy that could save Toyota.  Japan is a country with few natural resources, and after World War II, much of its industrial infrastructure was destroyed. Companies couldn’t afford to waste any assets or resources. Japanese employees were hired for life, so their continuous improvement became a vital factor for economic success, too. Thriftiness was vital for the economic success of any company, Toyota included. So, Toyota’s owner Toyoda Kiichiro and industrial engineer Taiichi Ohno devised the now-famous Toyota Production System according to Kaizen principles.  Even today, Gemba Kaizen is mostly used in industrial contexts. However, its basic idea – to improve productivity by eliminating unnecessary steps – is applicable to a wide range of disciplines and fields. Today, Gemba Kaizen is frequently employed by insurance brokers and hospitals. One method called clinical pathways is tightly connected to Gemba Kaizen. Clinical pathways is a plan used by hospitals to improve outcomes and reduce costs. It details all the essential tasks involved in treating patients with specific diseases.  Administrations employ Gemba Kaizen, too. Many Gemba Kaizen ideas are used in what is called “lean administration.”  Administrative acts, such as drawing up birth certificates, can easily be standardized and improved with the aid of a Kaizen approach. A few Romanian cities even used the Kaizen philosophy to keep their downtown areas safe and clean.  It’s no wonder many companies in different sectors use Gemba Kaizen nowadays. The idea of improving and reducing waste can be realized everywhere, from our workplaces to our personal lives. So how can you begin practicing Gemba Kaizen too? Find out in the following blinks! Though many corporations strive for efficiency, few are so outstanding in their organization as nature’s humble ant colony. So what’s the secret behind these incredibly effective insects? Ants achieve order through a set of simple standard processes, and we too can benefit from standards.  Standards represent the best known way to do things at a given time. With firm standards, everyone knows what to do and what’s expected of them. This eliminates mistakes caused by the idiosyncrasies of individual workers in one clean sweep. Think about it: when you’re new at a job, the first thing you look to are the workplace standards, so you can find your footing.  Standards work best when they change and improve as your company grows. Whenever a worker in your company finds a viable solution for some problem, you can adapt your standards accordingly – all while making sure that the solution doesn’t get lost in the shuffle and that everyone else profits from it, too. Imagine that workers on an assembly line have to constantly turn around to get tools from a box behind them. One of them puts the box in front her. Since she now needs no time for turning around and grabbing tools, she can produce more, and faster. It’s a good solution, so why not make it a standard procedure? Turning solutions into standards also empowers employees. Knowing that their best ideas can be implemented to help the broader workplace will give them a stronger sense of commitment to their job. And, of course, standards make a powerful impact on efficiency, even when the same equipment is used in a different way.   In 1961, two electronics manufacturers, one European and one Japanese, embarked on a joint venture. While both used exactly the same machines, the Japanese workers reached a higher productivity rate of 99.2 percent – solely through the use of standards – while the Europeans only achieved 98 percent productivity. This is just one example of the power of standards! But they’re not the only tool that’s central to Kaizen; self-discipline is vital, too. Self-discipline plays a key role in Japanese culture, especially in the workplace. The workplace, Gemba, is where value is generated. Kaizen philosophy influenced five powerful practices that use self-discipline to keep the Gemba streamlined. These are the five Ss. The first of the five Ss of proper workplace organization is Seiri, which means to sort out all unnecessary items from the Gemba. It’s a popular Kaizen technique, in which a leader will walk through the Gemba and mark everything that’s not essential with red tape. Next, the workers have the opportunity to object to any labelling and prove that a tagged item is necessary. After that, all items still tagged will be removed. After Seiri comes Seiton, which means to straighten things out. All necessary items maintain an orderly place, so that everyone knows where to find them at all times. The third S is Seiso: sweep the work floor, keeping everything clean and tidy. Seiketsu is the fourth step. It’s about systematizing the first three steps, which means ensuring your workplace practices Seiri, Seiton and Seiso every day. Going through these four steps finally builds Shitsuke, the last S. Shitsuke is about maintaining and standardizing what you’ve achieved so far. It implies becoming self-disciplined and doing the other four Ss as a habit. Some Japanese companies take the five Ss very seriously. On one occasion, a group of Japanese managers inspected a German factory that their company wanted to buy. But upon seeing workers smoking in the Gemba, they decided not to buy the factory, convinced that the workers had no self-discipline. The five Ss are the backbone of creating a Kaizen philosophy on a daily basis. A well-organized workplace is the starting point for other important Kaizen tools like visual management and reducing waste. More on those tools in the next blinks! These days you often hear people claiming to be visual thinkers. Well, the truth is that we all are! Pictures and charts are great aids for understanding abstract situations and concepts. And that’s where visual management comes in. This strategy employs a combination of simple visual tools to provide information on working processes.  Visual management helps identify problems and makes it easier to maintain standards. When a manager makes her rounds, she doesn’t have the time to play detective and look for hidden problems. Instead, visual tools will provide her with all the essential information. You can use symbols to indicate where a worker has to stand. If the manager walks through the Gemba and sees that the worker isn’t at his place, she’ll know that there’s something wrong. Visualizing also highlights the potential for improvement. If, using a whiteboard, you map out the day’s goals, the tasks already accomplished and the work in progress, you can tell with a single glimpse if there’s still something left to improve.  Imagine you have two production lines. One manufactures front tires, the other rear tires. If every completed pair is noted on the whiteboard, it becomes clear when one line is operating much faster than the other. To better synchronize both lines, simply exchange fast workers with slow workers and neither line needs to wait for the other. Visual management can also motivate employees by visualizing aims. It’s very rewarding for us to see our progress visualized – think of that great feeling you get from looking at a to-do list with every item checked off! To motivate your employees, why not plot each day’s progress on a chart? It’s a simple trick that yields a great positive impact. Visual management is an invaluable tool in an increasingly complex work environment. It’s cheap, commonsensical and allows us to save our time for the real work that needs doing. With the principles and practices of Gemba Kaizen in place, it’s time to consider the role of a company’s upper management. Gemba Kaizen isn’t just a strategy: it’s a mind-set. It must be practiced by the head of the company, and practiced in a way that provides a leading example for employees. Think of it this way: a hand couldn’t possibly carry out a motion without the necessary nerve impulse from the brain. A CEO must make it totally clear that Kaizen will be implemented and that everybody has to come on board; otherwise, the goals of productivity and efficiency just won’t be fulfilled. But people don’t always respond well to change. Sometimes employees need a little convincing, and the CEO is the best person for that task.  Take lean manufacturing legend Art Byrne as an example. When he enters a company as its new CEO, he personally trains the management in Kaizen, so everybody knows he’s behind it and that it has to be done. And he’s strict: reluctant managers get fired. A CEO also has to immerse himself in the Gemba, or workplace. For example, one CEO of a well-known company cleans the office toilets every morning, setting a model for self-discipline. That’s definitely one way to show that you walk the talk as a leader! CEOs should also remember that a focus on the future is more beneficial than dwelling on the mistakes of the past. A significant portion of a CEO’s time should go toward building an environment of constant improvement.  For example, one goal might be to reduce the amount of time spent on a specific task by five percent. Once that’s achieved, another goal has to be set to reach a new level of efficiency.  This redefining of goals helps to establish a process of constant improvement. Of course, it’s important for the CEO to be a “lean zealot,” but that’s not all. Read on to find out about another vital aspect of Kaizen leadership. To understand problems and maintain standards, the manager needs to be in touch with the Gemba. Since standards are the backbone of the working process, they must be maintained constantly.  Picture a pizza manufacturer where the mozzarella keeps spoiling over the course of each afternoon.  The solution is for all workers to wash their hands more frequently – this consequently becomes a standard.  New, improved standards can also arise from problem solving. But if the standards aren’t maintained, such as if the manager fails to check whether workers do indeed wash their hands, these solutions will quickly be forgotten. Constant improvement secures the future of the company. Every manager has to do his or her part to keep improvements coming. The place for improvements and innovations is the Gemba, so this is where managers should be. Only in the Gemba can one see where elements of Muda exist, and where there is room for improvement. Soichiro Honda, the founder of Honda, never had a real office because he was always walking through the Gemba. If the workers see that their managers are in the Gemba, demonstrate Gemba Kaizen and are self-disciplined, their own motivation will increase. Both maintenance and improvement occur within the Gemba. Therefore, the manager needs to be there to do his or her job right. Of course, if the managers are active at all levels of the Gemba, they know their workers much better and both sides have more faith in each other. This is integral to the effective practice of Gemba Kaizen. The key message in this book: Gemba Kaizen is driven by constant improvement and self-disciplined employees, with managers engaged at all levels of the workplace. Through a handful of simple, common-sense techniques, you can use Kaizen philosophy within your company to streamline, revolutionize and thrive.  Actionable advice: Ask five questions to get to the bottom of any problem.  The next time you try to get to the bottom of a problem, use the five-why technique. One should always ask why at least five times to get to the bottom of the problem. For example: Why is there an increase in absenteeism? Why are so many workers hurt in the Gemba? Why is the floor slippery? Why does the machine leak? Why is the valve not tightly closed? Soon enough, the answer will be right under your nose! Suggested further reading: Leading Change by John P.

This might seem innocuous enough, but the truth is, all that time spent staring at a screen is not healthy. It’s not just that constantly using a smartphone will prevent you from being aware of what’s happening around you. More seriously, these phones are addictive because they’re designed to be that way. Using them for a little bit is fine, but letting your phone usage snowball can become problematic. These blinks will show you the basic psychology and science behind phone addiction. Using that knowledge, you’ll learn how to build a better and healthier relationship with your phone – and with technology more generally. This is not a diatribe, but a practical guide that will give you some common sense tips on how best to break up with your phone. What’s more, once you’ve made that decision, you’ll be shown how to get the most out of all that free time you’ll find yourself with. In these blinks you’ll learn: how hunter-gatherer living shaped modern phone habits; the relationship between getting distracted and poor memory; and what hormone regulates sleep cycles. Just take a look around you. On public transport, in restaurants, on street corners, whichever way you look today you’ll most likely see people – including children – glued to their phones. And the evidence is not just anecdotal. The data is clear. According to a 2016 Deloitte survey conducted in the United States, the average American checks his or her phone an average of 47 times each day. In the 18 to 24 age bracket, this number shoots up to a whopping 82 times per day. What that means, in terms of time, was clarified by research published in 2015 on hackernoon.com. Americans spend an average of four hours a day with their phones. That’s 28 hours per week, basically the same as having a fairly busy part-time job! So how do you know if you’re addicted? Thankfully, there’s a straightforward test you can take. It’s called the Smartphone Compulsion Test. It can be found online, and was designed by the University of Connecticut’s Dr. David Greenfield. Some of the key questions include: Do you occasionally spend more time with your phone than intended? Do you scroll without any sense of direction? Do you find yourself communicating more with people via your phone, rather than in real life? Do you keep your phone switched on in bed? Do you tend to stop what you’re doing so you can respond to something on your phone? If you find yourself answering yes to questions like these, then chances are you’ve got an addictive relationship with your phone. But don’t panic – you are not alone. Let’s begin by looking at why checking your phone really is a form of addiction, and what it means for you. If there’s one type of scientific experiment ever-present in the popular imagination, then it’s the ones in which rats have their behavior manipulated in some way. Traditionally, the rats are given food or electric shocks to encourage, or discourage, certain behaviors and tendencies. Such experiments rely on the presence of a certain hormone in the brain called dopamine. And you guessed it, humans react to it to. But how does it work? Well, when dopamine is released, it attaches to pleasure receptors in the brain and we experience pleasure. If a specific activity consistently causes dopamine to be released in the brain, we start to connect that activity with the dopamine release, and will engage in it more often. This dopamine hit served a useful function when humans were hunter-gatherers. It motivated us to forage and hunt, again and again; eating was a reward that produced a fresh release of dopamine. The downside to dopamine, though, is clear: it can also generate undesirable addictions and cravings. Those who know the science can use dopamine for their own purposes. Just look how social media is designed. Take Ramsay Brown, the founder of the start-up Dopamine Labs, which creates algorithms for social media apps. Each algorithm is designed to trigger a dopamine release in the brains of individual users. That way, they’ll keep using their phones and continue interacting with the app in question for longer periods of time. For example, an algorithm stores “Likes” or messages from other users, but it doesn’t release them to the user in real time. Instead, the algorithm takes note of the user’s app interaction patterns, and knows when the user is likely to shift to doing something else. At that precise moment, the app releases its stored Likes and messages. This user feedback results in the release of dopamine in the user’s brain. This, in turn, keeps them in the app environment. The user becomes hooked. Distraction is commonly thought of as something negative. But in reality, distraction is an entirely natural phenomenon. In fact, distraction was key to survival in early human history. Back then, we had to be highly attuned to our surroundings. After all, a predator could be lurking in the undergrowth, and so we needed to be ready to run. However, that’s not the whole truth. Our inclination to being distracted also comes down to neurobiology. For starters, the act of concentrating is hard work for the brain. There are two reasons for this. First off, the brain has to decide what to focus on. It’s a complex task performed by the prefrontal cortex. And the prefrontal cortex tends to get fatigued pretty quickly – you can think of it as a large muscle. If it has to make too many consecutive decisions, it becomes overwhelmed. Distraction soon sets in, as we find ourselves unsure of what to concentrate on. Second, sustained concentration takes effort. The brain must shut off all unnecessary internal and external inputs. Additional sensory information and distracting thought processes must not be allowed to interfere and compete for attention. Although we’re not aware of this occurring, it takes our brains a lot of effort to sustain high levels of concentration. So what about phones? Well, as it turns out, they are great at distracting the brain. Let’s compare them to books to get an idea of why. When you’re reading a book, distractions only come from the outside world. Perhaps there’s a knock at the door, or you get a phone call. It’s pretty clear for the brain what it should devote its attention to. But with phones, it’s different. Ads, links and pop-ups appear on-screen, right where we’re trying to concentrate. Simply put, the brain has to go to a lot more effort to maintain focus. It gets drained sooner, and maintaining attention becomes more difficult. The result is that it succumbs to distractions more quickly. Before we know it, we’re surfing the web or checking emails, rather than doing what we intended. There’s a lesson we can learn from this. If you’ve got a text to read, you’re better off reading a hard copy or an ad-free e-book than attempting to do it on your phone. Memory makes us who we are. That’s why the onset of illnesses like Alzheimer’s among older people is so feared. But issues with memory affect younger generations too. Just think of how difficult it can be as a student to memorize facts and figures for tests. It won’t come as a surprise to learn that phones are a contributing cause of this. Phones can do real damage to your short-term memory. Your short-term memory – or working memory – is the part of your brain that tracks what’s going on in the present moment, juggling all the bits of information that you need to process. For instance, it stops you from forgetting that you’re looking for your keys while you’re looking for your keys. But short-term memory can only keep track of a small number of things at any one time. In fact, in a study from 1956, psychologist George A. Miller found that can only hold around seven items simultaneously. Recently, science author Nicholas Carr scaled that down to a more realistic two to four items. Phones can interfere with your short-term memory through constant distraction. Every time you glance at your phone, your short-term memory is prevented from retaining information about what’s going on in the real world. After all, the working memory can only keep track of a few things simultaneously. Good luck remembering who you’ve just met at a dinner party if you’re receiving a stream of notifications via social media. And it’s not just your working memory that suffers. Phones also damage long-term memory. Your long-term memory’s function is to retain information about what happened last week, last year or a long time ago. But here’s the rub. Data like that starts its journey in the short-term memory, and is then stored in long-term memory. What’s more, only some of the information ends up getting transferred from one to the other. That’s because the transferal process takes up a huge amount of energy. The result is that when the short-term memory receives too much distracting input from a phone, the whole process breaks down. Information does not get relocated to the long-term memory. And your phone is to blame. Social media is one of the great innovations of the digital age. There are many practical benefits to its existence, but its effects on individuals’ emotional states can be tremendous. It is not unusual to be flung between feeling happy, anxious, interested, disgusted and lonely within just a few minutes on social media. Needless to say, all that turbulence wreaks havoc on rest and relaxation. Most noticeably, phones disturb your ability to fall asleep. This is due to the fact that phones are designed to be highly stimulating and to grab your attention. Trying to fall asleep with your phone nearby is much like trying to doze off on the living room sofa – with the TV blaring or your friends having a heated political discussion. It’s these conditions that you take to bed with you if that’s where your phone is. Furthermore, the blue light given off by phone screens can also cause problems. This part of the color spectrum tricks your brain into thinking that it’s still daytime. So if you’re replying to a late-night text, you’re going to find it harder to fall asleep. There is a science to sleep. When the brain no longer detects blue light, it starts producing the sleep regulatory hormone melatonin. And it’s melatonin that gets your body ready for sleep. All this means that if you look at your phone too late in the evening, getting to sleep will become more difficult. But that’s only the first step to poorer health. Sleep disruption, as caused by phones, can lead to chronic fatigue. And chronic fatigue, in turn, may result in more severe illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease. According to a 2008 Harvard Medical School study, even low-levels of sleep deprivation may adversely affect mood, decision-making and learning ability. What’s more, according to the same study, the onset of symptoms can arrive fast. Normally you need seven to eight hours of sleep a night. But all it takes is a stretch of ten days with six hours of sleep per night for damage to be done. Your alertness will be as poor as if you’d gone 24 hours without any sleep at all. The lesson is clear. Not only do you not need your phone in bed, you should try to avoid it in the hours before going to bed as well. Let’s be clear. Deciding you want to spend a little less time with your phone is not about making a moral judgment. There’s no need to fundamentally change your view on your phone. However, a trial run breakup is a good place to start. It will help you decide whether your phone habits are unhealthy, and how you can improve your interactions with your phone. There’s no need to panic. You can have a little break from your phone, and you’ll always be able to go back to your old habits if it’s not for you. If you do decide to reduce your phone usage, you’ve got to be crystal clear with yourself as to why you’re doing it. In other words: What is your motivation? It’s not enough just having a hazy notion that less time spent on your phone would be good. You have to be prepared. After all, you wouldn’t leave your partner for someone else just because you have some ill-defined idea of a better relationship. No – you should be certain about what would be different in this new relationship. Find your motivation. Breaking up with your phone could, for instance, give you the opportunity to learn a new language, or to spend quality time with loved ones. The other element to breaking up with your phone involves being aware of your own behavior. Try to work out exactly how much time you spend on your device every day. Don’t worry – you don’t have to carry around a stopwatch. Tracking apps like Moment or Offtime can record how often you look at your phone, and the amount of time you spend on your phone each day. The process of working out your phone habits will mean that you’ll be in a much better position to set a realistic target. If you know how long you’re on your phone, then you know how much time you’ll be able to save, and what activities you could use that time for instead. Without a doubt, some of the most addictive elements on your phone are social media apps. Much like junk food, it’s hard to stop consuming social media once you’ve started. But deleting them really isn’t that hard to do. Simply delete the app from your phone. Certainly, some message will pop up to ask questions and cast doubt on your intentions. Perhaps it’ll warn you that data will be permanently deleted. Just ignore it. In the digital age, that data can be recovered. It’ll be sitting in the internet cloud, ready to be downloaded to your phone if you ever come back. Still unsure? Just think of all the real-life experiences you could have, instead of messing around on an app. Maybe focus on one that’s brought you a lot of joy, like an excursion in nature or a house party. Think hard, which kind of experiences do you value more? The shadow world of social media, or human connections in the real world? Asking yourself this, and articulating your wants, will ensure that you can delete those apps and move on. If you’re worried that deleting your social media apps might be too big of a step, there’s really no cause for concern. This decision is not final, and you can always return after a few weeks or months. There’s nothing stopping you. Of course, remember that you’re not actually deleting your accounts; all social media is still accessible from your computer. The key word here is accessibility – you can now start to interact with social media when you consciously wish to do so. And the same lessons we learned about phone usage can be applied to your computer habits. Only open your internet browser when you have something specific to do. Even then, limit your activity to a set time. One of the classic symptoms of breaking up with your phone is called “Fear of Missing Out,” or FOMO for short. In order to avoid FOMO, it’s very important to know what you’re going to fill your time with in advance of your breakup. Otherwise you’ll just reach for your phone when you get bored. Begin by recalling what you enjoy when you’re disconnected from the world. Make some lists, trying not to feel limited by the recent past. Perhaps there were activities you loved doing as a kid, or maybe there are things that have always fascinated you, but that you never had time to pursue? And of course, there are bound to be people that you’d like to spend more time with. Once you’ve jotted down your ideas, the next step is to create a more concrete plan. Make a schedule that fits with your routine. Remember that you don’t have to do everything at once – pacing things out will work wonders. Imagine you’ve decided on a two-week breakup with your phone. Some of the things you could do might include solving a crossword puzzle, going on a nature excursion, taking a drawing class, organizing a board games party, visiting a local museum, meeting friends or experimenting with a new recipe. But there’s one activity that trumps all others, and it’s the most basic one to human existence. Use your newfound time to exercise. We live in an industrialized, digital age. That means that we can end up feeling quite disconnected and alienated from our bodies. Phones don’t help in the slightest here: overuse your phone, and your body will start to feel like an unnecessary appendage. Needless to say, it’s also far healthier to exercise than it is to use your phone. There are all kinds of exercises that can help you explore and reconnect with your body. They could range from something as simple as a walk or doing a bit of relaxed yoga, right through to dance classes. Exercise with friends can also be fun, and there are even some video games that require vigorous effort. So, no more excuses.  After all, even if you do go back to using your phone more regularly, there’s every chance your life will have been enriched in the meantime. Who can really turn their nose up at reconnecting with friends, getting back into hobbies or learning new skills? So far we’ve got to grips with the issues involved with phone usage, and how you can benefit from a break. But abstract reasoning will only get you so far. You have to break habits, and that challenge should not be underestimated. So in this and the next blink we’ll look at a 30-day plan that’ll help you unplug from your phone. Let’s get started. Over the first two days you should use an app to track how often you’re on your phone. You’ll probably find it’s more often than you think. This step, therefore, is all about increasing your awareness. On days 3 and 4, you should pay close attention to your feelings before, during, and after using your phone. You should also pay close attention to how often you interrupt a given activity to check your phone. In particular, consider whether you feel better after working on a task without interruptions. During this time, you may notice that your brain craves the dopamine reward triggered by checking your phone. Equally, try to detect the disappointment of distraction, of realizing that there is nothing new or noteworthy when you look at your phone. On days 5, 6 and 7 you should refrain from using social media apps. As we discussed earlier, put that free time to active use for things you love. Exercise, podcasts, or picnic – anything you like doing. On day 8 disable all notifications. Remember that all those pings and vibration alerts have been designed as cues to get you back on your phone. Days 8 and 9 are also the time to prune down your apps. Only keep essential ones, such as apps for banking or maps. Everything else should be deleted. Social media, gaming or dating apps are all no-gos. Now, all that freed-up mental energy and time you used to spend on these apps can instead be used for productive tasks. On day 10, set up a charging station that’s not in your bedroom. That way you won’t be compelled to use your phone before sleep and then again the moment you wake up. Prepare yourself for days 10, 11 and 12 by getting some interesting books, setting up a meditation corner, or simply thinking of any other meaningful activity that doesn’t involve your phone. On days 13 and 14, you should establish phone-free zones around your apartment. The dining table is a good place to start. You can also sketch out phone free time periods. Do you really need it after 6 p.m., for instance? Doing that will also stop you phubbing. That’s the “phone snubbing” that occurs when you check a message or a notification, ignoring everyone actually around you in real life. Great! You’re halfway through the 30-day program. Let’s take the last steps in the last blink. The first two weeks of the 30-day plan were all about the phone. Weeks three and four are about you. On days 15 and 16 you should try to practice some basic mindfulness. Whenever you find yourself reaching for your phone, tell yourself to stop, breathe and just be. Listen to your breath. Then ask yourself whether looking at your phone is really that important. This process will strengthen your behavioral awareness and give you a simple tool to stop you unnecessarily checking your phone. On days 17 and 18, try some concentration exercises. This could be as simple as repeating the two times table as long as you can or listening to a piece of music with your full concentration. If you work on your ability to focus, you’ll improve your resistance to being distracted by your phone. Days 19 and 20 are big ones. They’re for your first trial separation. You need two full days for this, so it may be best to do it over a weekend. It’s simple. Just switch off your phone. That’s it. Be sure you keep a notebook on hand in case you need to jot anything down or look anything up later. This will help you resist reaching for your phone. On days 22 and 23, reflect on your two-day trial separation. You’ll be able to recognize and weigh up what you like about your phone, and, alternatively, what you like about phone-free time. On days 24, 25, and 26, clean up those last aspects of digital life that have been annoying you. For instance, if your email inbox is overflowing, unsubscribe from anything that’s no longer relevant. Next, create a new folder for emails that need a reply. That way, from now on, you’ll have a clear visualization of tasks that actually require your attention.   During days 27, 28, 29 and 30, keep on monitoring your phone behavior. Perhaps you’ll find that you’re checking your phone less frequently –  and possibly more consciously too. If you’re up for it, now’s the time for a second two-day trial separation. Just be sure that in this final stretch that you also plan for the future. Schedule a regular time each month for checking in on how your new phone rules are working. That way, you’ll be less likely to fall back into old habits. The key message in these blinks: More and more people the world over are becoming addicted to their phones. And it really is a form of addiction. Social media developers are partly to blame; they engineer apps around this principle. Addiction such as this can be detrimental to your attention span, memory and quality of sleep. Consequently, it’s well worth breaking up with your phone, or at the very least, reducing the time you spend on it. You’ll finally have the time for real-life experiences, and the space to get started on lifelong projects and dreams.  Actionable advice: Buy an alarm clock! One of the best indicators of phone addiction is the need to take your phone to bed. You think you’re just using it for the alarm, but more often than not you’re off using it within minutes of waking. There’s an easy way around this. Buy an old fashioned alarm clock that does nothing more than ring. You can leave your phone in another room and ensure a good night’s sleep, as well as a healthy start to the next morning.

On the surface, we should all be quite happy – but, of course, so many of us just aren’t. A great deal of stress and misery in modern life comes from our inability to find enough time to both develop our career and enjoy our personal life. Most of us feel like we have to give up one of these essential goals, and concentrate solely on the other.  But this isn’t true. We don’t have to give up our job, nor spend every waking moment slaving away at it – we can do both, and these blinks show you how. Although they concentrate mostly on strategies for working mothers, there is plenty of excellent advice that everyone can learn from.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why none of us has to spend the majority of our time at work; the hour at which we are generally most productive; and why the family meal doesn’t have to be dinner. How much do you work? Most of us think we toil at work for far too long, and our work/life balance seems heavily skewed towards work. This is especially true of working mothers: the more time they spend at work, the less time they have to spend with their families. But is this true? According to the 2013 American Time Use Survey, the average mother with a full-time job works 35 hours per week. Mothers who earn over $100,000 USD work even more – up to 44 hours per week. This does seem like a lot, but let’s take a closer look. A week has 168 hours. If we sleep eight hours each night and work 44 hours each week, we’ve still got 68 hours per week that aren’t spent at work. So why do we all think we’re workaholics? It comes down to interruptions: those small, unexpected events that break up our working day can actually make it feel longer. In order to measure her working week, one woman tried to keep her days as routine as possible to get an accurate measure of her time management. But it just wasn’t feasible. Constant interruptions when she least expected them kept her from working at a regular pace. Snow days prevented her from going to work, as did days when her children’s kindergarten was closed and family events, from a christening to an airport pickup.  Interruptions like these make us constantly feel like we’re behind schedule and always needing to catch up on work. But we shouldn’t have to feel this way! In the following blinks, we will look how people, particularly working mothers, can arrange their lives in order to get the most out of their days, weeks and years. Working mothers all know the feeling of guilt. Whether we feel like we’re neglecting our families or our career responsibilities, we end up putting a huge amount of pressure on ourselves to fulfill other people’s needs. But this pressure doesn’t have to be there at all. As we’ve seen, there’s enough time in the week to commit to work and enjoy free time. It’s just a case of planning time to ensure you make the most of both. But how? The first step is to find your opportunities for flexibility in your work. Today, 97 percent of full-time employees are afforded some sort of flexibility, and it’s important that you make the most of it. Remember those interruptions we learned about in the previous blink? Well, it’s the flexibility of your job that will help you cope with them.  This flexibility goes in both directions: it allows you to leave work earlier in family emergencies, but it also allows you to work from home, so that when the kids are in bed you’re able to catch up on what didn’t get done during the day.  There are several approaches to increasing flexibility in your job. If you work long hours and want to find more time to spend with your family, you could start working split shifts.  This would mean working early morning hours before the kids wake up, then spending quality time with them over breakfast, after which you can return to work. Or you might leave work early to visit your kids’ activities in the afternoon, but then work another “shift” from home once they have gone to sleep.  Another idea is to work remotely from home or somewhere else at least one or two days a week. While many of us worry that working from home will cause our private and professional lives to mix in an unpleasant way, this isn’t necessarily the case. A study by IBM and BYO found that people who are able to work from home could work a whopping 57 hours per week before experiencing work-life conflicts – and that was only among a quarter of participants! The first step to enjoying free time is preventing yourself from working too much. Of course, you could limit your overtime hours by clocking off everyday at the same time, but if this means you stop working before completing certain tasks, you might begin to feel quite inefficient.  Your best option is to start the day with your toughest task. According to a study by Johnson & Johnson, a person’s energy level peaks at 8:00 a.m. So, save your gossiping with colleagues for lunch and spend the morning working on the most difficult item on your agenda – the one that is most urgent, and requires the most effort.  You can also maximize your efficiency by managing your meetings – they don’t have to be a pointless waste of your time! There are a couple of ways to go about this. First, look through your calendar and find the meetings for which your presence probably isn’t required. By choosing not to attend these kinds of meetings, you'll have gained an hour or so to work on something productively.  For the meetings you do have to attend, try and shorten them whenever possible. Say you’ve got two 60-minute meetings coming up. Why not shorten them to 45 minutes each? This isn’t a huge cut, but it will save you half an hour overall. It all adds up! Finally, to ensure you have enough time for yourself, plan things to do in your free time. Schedule something in the evening at least once a week that will get you out of the office early, or at least on time. Why not sign up for that guitar lesson starting in the early evening? You’ll also boost your motivation levels at work if you’ve got something to look forward to. The tips provided in the previous blink are easy and practical ways to improve your time management at work. There are two more techniques that will help you cut down stress in your job, but these require a little more thinking.  One strategy to streamline your week is to plan it before it even begins. According to a 2013 survey by Accountemps, Tuesday is the most productive day of the week with Monday lagging behind at only 26 percent productivity! Why is this?  Well, people tend to have a lot of meetings on Monday, and they also spend the day sorting through what needs to be done, as well as what wasn’t done the week before.  To avoid this “Monday trap,” plan your week at the end of the previous one. On Friday afternoon, just before you leave for the weekend, make a plan about what you are going to do in the week ahead. This will take some pressure off your Monday schedule. The final way to become more productive at work is simply to try and love what you do. We all know that we perform better when we enjoy what we’re doing. So, why not try and work on as many enjoyable things as possible? One woman leading a career in science, for instance, found that she was lacking drive at work. She realized that it was because her time was being taken up by administrative tasks, rather than the scientific research that she loved to do. So, she planned her weeks more consciously to ensure she could spend some hours in the lab again. Soon enough, her motivation returned.  So far, we’ve discovered strategies for excelling in our careers while finding time for ourselves. The next few blinks will focus on how you can bring new energy to your family life too.  Planning is key to an efficient and flexible work life. But what about when it comes to your home life?  Ultimately, your approach should be quite similar.  Spending quality time with your family requires some planning and the same motivation as your work life does. But remember: being around your family and being with your family are two different things.  Think through your weekday evenings and plan a shared activity with your family. No, watching TV together doesn’t count! If the sun is shining, why not take your kids to the playground and visit the ice cream truck afterwards? In the winter, it might be nice to take a weekly trip to the library and find some new books together.  Being active together is a great opportunity to spend quality time, and exercise is a proven mood booster. Why not take your kids to the pool once a week or go for a bike ride around the neighbourhood?  A classic way to enjoy family time is through sharing a meal together – but it doesn’t always have to be a sit-down dinner. A study by the UCLA found that only 17 percent of families have dinner together every night. About 60 percent have dinner semi-regularly, but these dinners tended to be fragmented. Instead, why not try sharing breakfast together, or coming home to enjoy a family lunch.  Another family activity that we often dismiss is taking your kids to work. If you think it’d be too boring for them, think again! We often forget that, for kids, even the simplest activities around our work life (like riding an elevator or seeing a conference room) can be an adventure. Why not take them with you on special occasions?  This also gives you an educational opportunity to share your passions, and discuss matters of success and challenge. Once you start taking greater efforts to enjoy family time, it’s also important to consider how you could spend more romantic time with your partner. When asked by the author what they’d do with more free time, most women answered they’d like to spend more adults-only time with their husbands or partners. Between juggling the demands of work and family, our love lives inevitably get neglected. But it needn’t be this way! The key to finding time for romantic moments in your busy schedule is making it a priority and being creative with timing.  Remember those dates you had at the beginning of your relationship? Believe it or not, it’s still possible to have those dates again – it just takes a little bit of planning. A date doesn’t have to be at night; in fact, what could be nicer than taking a break in your busy schedule to have a romantic lunch with your partner in the city? An important thing to remember is that administrative time with your partner, in which you plan childcare, groceries and so on, should be scheduled separately from romantic time.  As strange as it sounds, some couples like to think that going shopping or cleaning together counts as romantic time. While it might be fun to do things as a team, romantic time works best when you can just concentrate on each other and nothing else.  Finally, seize opportunities and savor moments as they come – you don’t have to have each moment carefully planned. No one is too busy for a five-minute morning cuddle in bed, or a kiss with your partner before you take off to work in the morning. There’s nothing worse than finishing work and coming home to a house full of pending chores. There’s no point in using time management to create free time for yourself if you just fill it up with housework. In times like these, it’s important to just let go.  Remember, you’re not participating in some game show that gives you extra points for empty clothes hampers or supremely well-adjusted children. So, how can you begin to let go of your perfectionism? Well, one mother decided she would let her daughter wear whatever she wanted to school, letting go of the mandatory morning fight about matching clothes. Her daughter is still alive and happy, even though sometimes her shirt doesn’t match her skirt. For her part, the woman found she had less to stress about each morning.  Another important step is learning to accept help. Nobody can do everything by themselves, and there’s no shame in getting some assistance when you can. It lets you focus on what you do best.  If your financial budget allows for it, you can get help cleaning the house, the garden or have groceries delivered to save time. Kids can also participate in housework and learn to take responsibility by doing so.  Childcare is a good way to save yourself time, but plan it wisely. Did you know it’s often easier and more time-effective to have someone come to your house for childcare, such as a nanny, rather than investing in daycare?  Of course, it’s important not to skimp on childcare.  Not only is it vital that your child spends time in an environment where they feel safe and encouraged, your career will also benefit from it. According to economist Sylvia Hewlett, women who take at least three years for parental leave lose 37 percent of their earning power over the remaining decades of their careers.  So, finding childcare that you feel comfortable with, even if it costs a little more, is worth it in the end.  So you’ve made time for work, for your family and for your partner. Now it’s time to make time for yourself. If you still think it’s not possible, here’s a little experiment for you to try: get addicted to a TV show.  Think about it, when you are totally absorbed in House of Cards, free time almost magically seems to appear out of nowhere. You might find that you have half an hour after work and before dinner where you can squeeze in an episode. In fact, you’ll start to find free hours whenever you can.  Now that you’ve worked out how to find these free hours, why not start using them for something more rewarding? Studies show that TV is fun, but only ranks near the middle on scales of human enjoyment. It is better than commuting or getting your car repaired, but it is less fun than socializing or having sex.  Reading scores a little higher on the enjoyment scale, but what’s even more fun is getting creative in your leisure time. Creative leisure time can include picking fresh fruit, garden work in general, going to the opera or knitting.  Finally, remember that you’re allowed to take a personal day off from time to time. Larry Kanarek, who managed the McKinsey office in Washington, D.C., observed that everybody who was quitting because of exhaustion and burnout had free vacation time that they had not yet used.  So why take the risk? Use your vacation days before you get tired of working, and put yourself first. After all, it’s only by taking care of yourself that you can continue being all the women you want to be: professional, partner, mother and individual. The key message in this book: As working mothers, we want to do it all: build a career, raise a family and find personal time. But doing so requires some balancing and organizing, as well as letting go of your perfectionist demands. This will leave you feeling happier, fulfilled and able to appreciate the small, beautiful moments in life as they come. Actionable advice:  Work well to sleep well!  Be careful with the kind of work you do right before bed when you are working split shifts, as staring at a screen at night may result in a restless sleep. Plan this shift as you would plan your workday, being sure to include time to unwind before going to bed. You even might find some tasks that don’t require much focus, such as answering some emails, planning the next day or editing documents, that are well suited to a quiet late night session.  Suggested further reading: The Politics of Promotion by Bonnie Marcus  The Politics of Promotion (2015) offers insights into the ways women can prime themselves for promotion in any line of work. Filled with actionable tips and strategic career advice, it provides the political savvy you need to maneuver within the workplace and secure your next promotion. Got feedback?

When did your company start claiming to be your family instead of your coworkers? Authors Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founders of the successful software company Basecamp – answer these questions and more, and also provide a much-needed antidote to some of the crazy hallmarks of the modern workplace. Instead of pushing yourself to work longer hours, meet tight deadlines and see the competition as your mortal enemy, it’s time to discover a calmer way of doing things. In these blinks, you’ll learn the difference between working hard and working smart. You’ll see why a successful, profitable company isn’t just compatible with a good work-life balance, but actually benefits from it. Join two renegades of the corporate world who aren’t afraid to call out our exploitative, unsustainable working culture. In these blinks, you’ll discover the reasons why you need to start treating your company like a product; ways to fit all your work into an eight-hour day; and an approach to bringing calm to your office for good. How many times have you burst through your front door after a long day, collapsed on the sofa and exclaimed, “It’s so crazy at work!” Unfortunately, in our modern era of long hours, early starts and weekend work sessions, this scenario can be a nightly occurrence. Welcome to the workaholic world, in which 70 to 80-hour weeks have somehow become the norm. What’s the end result of this crazy working culture? Unfortunately, it’s not higher productivity. More often than not, all the extra hours you spend at your desk aren’t spent on work that’s vital. Instead, they’re frittered away in a haze of anxiety and distractions brought about by the demands of new technologies and endless meetings. In fact, the real outcome of long and hectic work days is added stress. This stress originates in the culture of our workplaces. Unhealthy workplace culture starts from the top and is handed down to managers, their subordinates and even the company’s customers. So, what’s the solution? How can organizations stop stress, change their culture and still maintain profitability? Well, the authors believe it all begins with changing the way you view your company. To begin with, you should start looking at it like a product, and treating it accordingly. Though this might seem like a crazy idea, look at it this way: If your company produces products, the company itself is also a tool - one that is used to make those products. Bearing that in mind, there are certain questions any good product manager should ask himself. Is your company simple for employees to use, or is it complicated? Where is it fast, and where is it slow? Does your company have any bugs that need fixing? Just as the best companies never stop trying to make their products as good as possible, a product manager with a curious mindset is continually searching for places to make improvements in company culture. And once you start searching, brace yourself - there will definitely be room for improvement. Indeed, organizations often share one very important trait with software. That trait? They both tend to have areas in which they crash, due to either faulty design or oversights on the part of the developer. Luckily, you’re about to discover how you can phase out the crazy and usher in an atmosphere of lasting calm in your company. Social media may be a valuable tool for keeping up with friends, new ideas and the latest cat videos, but unfortunately, it’s also a bottomless well of workaholic sentiment. Just consider the comments you see associated with #entrepreneur on social media, which include, “Extreme talent isn’t necessary, but extreme commitment is!” or “Conquer your competition!” Comments like these are made for the virtual world, but they often reflect attitudes that can have dramatic real-world consequences. One such attitude, which is propagated on social media and repeated in many offices, is that success can’t be attained without excessive hard work. But this simply isn’t true. After all, you may be putting in 18-hour days to make your entrepreneurial dreams a reality, but is that all-important brainwave going to hit you when you’re exhausted and burnt out? Probably not. In fact, the mundane truth is that progress and innovation are rarely achieved with blunt force. Instead, they are built brick by brick, week after week. Just consider Charles Darwin, the legendary evolutionary scientist. He wrote 19 books in his lifetime, including the seminal On the Origin of Species, and never worked more than four and a half hours per day. Another unhelpful idea, voiced both online and offline, is that the business world is like a war zone. This attitude is reinforced by the tendency to use the language of battle in business. Competitors are ‘conquered,’ companies describe their sales department as a ‘force’ rather than a team and new employees aren’t recruited, they’re ‘headhunted.’ Unfortunately, while these analogies might make life a little more exciting for office warriors, they also create a toxic workplace culture. After all, the entrepreneur who fancies herself a military leader and the competition ‘the enemy’ will find justification for engaging in unethical behavior and commercial skulduggery. So, what’s the solution to this problematic paradigm of war? Well, the authors think it’s pacifism. Instead of trying to dominate your competitors, look to your own business. Ask yourself if you’re making the amount of profit you need to meet your needs. Is that profit increasing year after year? If the answer is yes, you can rest as easy as a contented pacifist – no warmongering required. As co-founders of the successful software company Basecamp, the authors have done something almost unheard of in this day and age – they’ve given their employees an eight-hour work day. This might not sound that radical, but for many modern bosses eight hours isn’t nearly long enough. This is pretty crazy when you think about it. After all, eight hours is the same length as many long-haul flights, and they seem to take forever! So, why doesn’t eight hours at work feel as long as an intercontinental flight? And moreover, why doesn’t a 40-hour week feel long enough to get all your work done? Well, the hours we spend on an intercontinental flight are typically uninterrupted and hold few distractions. In contrast, the modern workplace provides us with a stream of interruptions in the form of emails, instant messenger chats, meetings or even bosses visiting your desk. The work day is punctuated by constant demands for our attention, and so it seems to shrink down until putting in those extra hours begins to feel perfectly reasonable. So, how can you calm the craziness, get home on time and still get your work done? Well, the good news is that there is an answer. The bad news is that you can’t implement it alone. In fact, you need your company to start treating your time like they would their products, intellectual property and data. Quite simply, they need to protect it. Unfortunately, many companies treat their employees’ time and attention as if it were an infinite resource able to accommodate any number of activities or demands. But in today’s world, an individual’s attention is perhaps the scarcest commodity of all. Fortunately, not all companies get it so wrong. At the authors’ company, they value their employees’ time. In order to preserve it, they’ve eliminated the lengthy status-update meetings, which have become a weekly occurrence in offices all over the world. Instead of forcing teams to sit and listen to each other talk about their work, they’ve devised a more time-efficient way of keeping everyone informed. Each team member adds their weekly status update to the company’s eponymous software, and people can check this when it’s convenient for them. This system allows employees bigger chunks of interaction-free time during which they can focus on their important tasks. As a leader, you help set the tone of your company. For better or worse, your senior position means that subordinates will take their cue from you. With this in mind, you better make sure the beliefs and values you’re spreading around your workplace are the right ones. These days, its commonplace for companies to push the idea that their employees are all one big family. Although this kind of sentiment might make you feel warm and fuzzy, you’d be well advised to run as fast as you can in the other direction when you hear it. Why? Because, frankly, it’s garbage. A company is not a family – it’s simply a group of people who work together to make things happen. This isn’t to say that coworkers can’t look after each other, but that’s a far cry from being family. After all, most families love one another unconditionally and will go to any lengths to protect each other. So why do so many organizations use this inaccurate analogy? Unfortunately, it’s often a cynical ploy to persuade employees to put in more hours at the office. By associating themselves with the idea of family, organizations are subtly priming their workers to make personal sacrifices in favor of work. The aim is to convince their employees that burning the midnight oil, working weekends and forgoing vacations aren’t questions of overtime, but of helping the family. If they can be tricked into this way of thinking, then employees might be persuaded to put aside their natural self-interest or subordinate their own needs and, ironically, the needs of their real families, to those of the company. Rather than calling your business a family, call it a business that helps families. This means letting your employees leave work at a decent hour each day, so they have time to eat dinner with their children. It means allowing your workers ample time off for vacations and providing a fulfilling workplace so that your colleagues can go off to their real families, happy and contented at the end of every day. Producing good work can be a stressful undertaking, especially when high standards come into play. But what about when it’s not the work itself that’s putting you under strain, but the processes that surround it? Even if striving to give your best will always be a little stressful, you can still make the process of doing so as calm as possible. Let’s take a look at one process that sends anxiety levels soaring in offices everywhere – meeting deadlines. Or, as the authors call them, dreadlines. Although setting a timeline for a project seems simple enough, things can get crazy when unreasonable expectations are involved. Many of us have had the unpleasant experience of having too much to do with too little time allocated, or of having projects expand in scope while their deadlines remain the same. Fortunately, there’s an easy way to take the dread out of deadlines for good. At the authors’ company, for example, they have a strict policy when it comes to the scope of time-sensitive projects. Namely, the scope of an ongoing project can never get bigger. In other words, once you get started, no one can increase the amount of work you have before a particular deadline. Moreover, the person meeting the deadline has the power to shrink the scope of the project, if necessary, to get it finished in time. Playing by these rules, no one in the company has to worry about missing deadlines at all. Another process that many companies could change is how employees introduce new ideas. In most organizations, it’s standard to convene a face-to-face meeting for presenting new concepts. Someone stands at the front of a room and speaks about the ideas they’ve been working on before receiving feedback. The problem with this approach is that instead of encouraging listeners to absorb this new information, it merely encourages them to react to it. And really, how useful is an ad-hoc reaction when the listener hasn’t had time to reflect? That’s why, at the authors’ company, new ideas are never presented face-to-face. Instead, they’re written down and uploaded to the company’s Basecamp software for colleagues to read privately. Crucially, everyone is encouraged to sleep on what they’ve read and think it over before reacting. Thus, when they finally do give feedback, it’s likely they’ll have taken as much time to consider the new idea as the coworker who pitched it in the first place. In Silicon Valley and beyond, entrepreneurs are disciples to the belief that big rewards cannot be achieved without an equally huge gamble. And unsurprisingly, this habitual risky behavior can lead to a lot of workplace craziness. What may be more surprising is that being too risk-averse can also lead to stress and anxiety in the office. In fact, when it comes to risk, it’s all about balance. The authors believe that their company’ has this balance just right. How? Well, they take risks, but they don’t take unmitigated risks. One recent risk, for instance, was to increase the monthly cost of their eponymous software from $29 to $99. Sounds pretty risky, right? And what’s more, they carried out zero market research beforehand to check how customers might feel about this new pricing. So, how did they mitigate this risk? Crucially, they didn’t raise the price for existing clients, only for potential new ones. They provided new software updates to their existing customers without increasing their price plan. So even if the new pricing disastrously reduced the number of new customer sign-ups, they could still rely on their approximately 100,000 existing clients. In other words, the authors took a risk, but it was calculated and easily reversed. Counterintuitively, being overly cautious about risk can also lead to soaring stress and anxiety in the workplace. Many companies, for instance, want to implement change but get stuck in a state of paralysis. Why? Well, they get fixated on eliminating any element of risk or uncertainty surrounding the change. Consequently, they embark on lengthy quests for predictive information. If, for example, they want to introduce a new product, they quiz potential clients about their level of interest, set up focus groups and conduct surveys. As a result, the whole company becomes mired in doubt and indecision. The solution to this problem is simple – just do it already. Real information will only be discovered if customers actually, not hypothetically, interact with a new product or change. Careful testing is merely a simulation and can only provide possible outcomes. Take a deep breath, make the change and let the market resolve your uncertainty. In hectic modern life, with the demands and expectations of others buzzing around, it’s easy to forget that you always have a choice when it comes to how you behave, what you prioritize and how you treat those around you. You may well have an exacting boss or a difficult client, but you’re still the captain of your own ship. What’s more, the individual choices you make determine whether your working environment is stressful or calm. One of the most important of these choices is the manner in which you treat your customers, specifically those who come to you with a problem. Jean-Louis Gassée, the former Head of Apple France, wisely stated that when it comes to handling customer complaints, there are two possible options. You can treat the complaint as highly important or you can shrug your shoulders and deem it trivial. Whatever position you choose to take, your customer will choose the other. That means that you’d better take every customer complaint seriously, because if you don’t the customer will. Let’s take a look at this dynamic in practice. Imagine that you’re a hotel manager whose guests complain that their room is too hot. If you shrug your shoulders, your guests are likely to angrily double-down on their grievance and make even more of a fuss. In other words, their complaint will take on even more importance in their minds. But if you apologize profusely, demonstrably share your concern and pledge to do everything in your power to correct this dreadful mistake, your guests will backtrack from their original outrage and assure you that it’s not that huge a problem after all. So, the next time a customer complains, remember to choose the right attitude. If you don’t, you’re forcing them to up the ante and ultimately burdening yourself with more conflict. Furthermore, you don’t have to be in a leadership position to shun craziness and choose serenity. Whatever your role, you still have a locus of control – a sphere of influence around you, to which you can introduce some calm. Within this area, however narrow, you have the power to improve your communication style with customers, redesign your interactions with colleagues and regain control over your own time. The key message in these blinks: Don’t fall for the popular rhetoric surrounding the modern workplace. Instead of pushing yourself to work more hours and bending over backward to meet unrealistic deadlines, focus on working smarter. By fiercely guarding your time and making your processes more efficient, you can get home on time and never again utter the words “It’s crazy at work!”  Actionable advice: Model a great work-life balance.  If you’re a boss that’s always telling your employees to take holidays, leave the office at a decent hour and take time off when they’re ill, then here’s a tip – take a look at your own behavior, too. After all, your subordinates are much more likely to follow your example than do as you say. If you’re always working weekends instead of taking your family on vacation, then your workers will assume that’s what is expected of them, no matter what you say. So if you want to improve the work-life balance in your office, make sure your own is in good shape first. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Yet, despite these wishes, time is something of which we never seem to have enough. This is where these blinks come in. They show you how you can find time in your schedule and space in your brain to spend most of your time doing what you want to do. Based on three central aims – Optimize, Automate and Outsource – they inform you how to unleash waves of efficiency in everything you do, from organizing your finances to maintaining your health. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you’ll never have to personally book a table in a restaurant ever again; why running errands is a thing of the past; and how to turn your smartphone into a portable bank manager. Maybe you’ve heard of the 80-20 rule? It states that 80 percent of what you accomplish is the result of a mere 20 percent of all the time and energy you invest. And this isn’t only applicable to work or study. It’s the case for everything you do. So how can we figure out what time isn’t worth spending? One way is to start tracking. But who’s got time to live their busy schedule and observe it? Luckily, there are resources out there to make tracking your time much easier. Enter RescueTime, a program that monitors what you’re actually doing on your computer all day. If you find that a particular website or application is stealing your day away, RescueTime will help you block access to it. Problem solved! But what if it’s not just your productivity you want to track, but your health? Take it back to basics with an old-school paper journal to record everything you eat during the day. You could also get your hands on a pedometer to count all the steps you take, or simply make an effort to weigh yourself each day. Because the more you know about your day, the sooner you’ll be able to improve it. But what does it mean to improve something as broad as our daily routine? Think of it as optimizing your processes. For a role model, look to IKEA. Each IKEA product comes with highly optimized instruction manuals for assembling each product, whether it’s a coffee table or geometric lamp. These instructions have been boiled down to their very essence – a few language-independent, easy-to-follow steps. It’s time to approach your life like IKEA approaches their manuals. Whatever the task, whether it’s writing emails or organizing meetings, you should minimize fuss and get it done in as few steps as possible. We all like to think of ourselves as great multi-taskers with brilliant memories. But often we don’t actually have enough room to juggle everything in our minds. Life would be so much simpler if we just had an extra brain. Well, guess what? You can have one! Several new tools have emerged to help us remember all those dates and details. Evernote, for example, is an app for taking notes of all kinds: textual or pictorial, hand-drawn or web-based. It’s also free and has no storage limit. The author himself has about 1800 notes in his Evernote at the moment! You can consider Evernote simply as a backup of your brain. Neuroscientists have even shown that Evernote organizes information in a very similar way to the human brain, linking similar thoughts together into complex, interconnected networks. But what if you know how to organize but want to spend less time organizing? Say hello to your very own virtual assistant. Today, you can hire a person or several people and delegate tasks to them online. Additionally, there are two kinds of virtual assistants: on demand and dedicated. An on-demand assistant service consists of a pool of assistants. Say you’ve got a task that needs doing, like proofreading a document or improving a PowerPoint presentation. Whoever’s available in the pool will do it. For $25 a month, Fancy Hands allows you to get assistance with as many as five tasks. For $95, you can request assistance with an unlimited amount of tasks per month. Dedicated assistants, on the other hand, will do all your tasks personally. This means there’s a closer relationship; they’ll get to know you and eventually take on more difficult tasks. For $197 a month, Zirtual gives you a dedicated assistant for ten hours every month.   Say you’ve got a great idea for the perfect bedroom shelving unit to suit your needs. You know you’ll have to build it yourself, which means buying the materials, borrowing tools and spending hours preparing and cleaning up. But if only there were an easier and less expensive way! Well, there is: 3D printing. 3D printing offers a world of possibilities for creating your own customized products. Take Shapeways, a site where you simply upload a 3D model, and they print it for you. The author, for example, wanted to create a custom bracket to mount his new MacMini to the wall. He made a simple sketch of his idea and used the online outsourcing platform Fiverr to find someone who could make a complete 3D model of it. He then sent this model to Shapeways and, a week later, the completed bracket was waiting for him in his mailbox. If that sounds like a success to you, then get this: the author then used the Shapeways ecommerce platform to sell his MacMini bracket, and made $400 by selling six of them. Customization won’t just save and earn you money, however. It will also give you more free time. Consider Vitamins on Demand, a service that collects all the medications and supplements you require and then organizes them into separate packs for each day. Say goodbye to loading up your holiday suitcase with all your pill bottles while worrying whether you’ve got them all. Instead, just grab the number of packs you need and head out the door! Want another example? Think about the arduous task of finding a suit that fits. If you want to cut that time in half, sign up to Indochino. This company produces tailored suits and will guide you through your measuring process, ensuring you’ve got measurements you can use again and again for a suit that fits just right. When Tim Ferriss published The 4-Hour Workweek, there was obviously some exaggeration involved – you simply can’t get a book written if you only work four hours each week! Nevertheless, the book made an important point: you need to make your workweek yours, and decide what to do, and when. So what’s the first step? Begin by determining which hours of the day are your best working hours. This will automatically make you more effective. Some people prefer working in the night; others, in the morning. Some like working a bit every day, while others like to squeeze a lot into shorter periods of time. Everybody works differently, so figure out what works best for you! It’s also vital to figure out what is slowing you down. Often it’s external factors – a supplier that’s always late, or those indecisive clients. The solution? Make the window for interaction with your clients smaller. This won’t only make your own day more effective, but force your clients to be more efficient, too. They can thank you for it later! And there’s also another part of your workday that’s sapping your time: the scheduling of meetings. Did you know that, on average, the normal procedure for organizing a meeting requires an exchange of seven emails? Luckily, applications such as ScheduleOnce will, as the name suggests, help you get that meeting scheduled the first time around. The app allows you to make your calendar public, so that you and your colleagues can find meeting times that work for all involved parties. If you had a clear conception of how much time you spend running errands each month, you’d be shocked. But come on, a dash to the corner store for toilet paper or dish soap? No big deal, right? Well, the fact is, these errands add up. If you want more productivity, you’ve got to kill those errands! But how to get started? One great way is by signing up for an online delivery service. Amazon’s Subscribe & Save, for instance, delivers necessities like toilet paper, razors, shampoo and laundry detergent to your door at certain intervals. Perhaps you go through two tubes of toothpaste every month; so arrange to have those two tubes delivered to you at the end of each month and never waste time buying toothpaste again. Though toilet paper is an obvious necessity, there are plenty of other important items that you can have delivered. For instance, by arranging via Subscribe & Save for an order of nine-volt batteries to arrive every six months, the author ensures that his smoke detectors always work. There are some errands that you can’t automate, however. You know, those ones that catch you by surprise, forcing you to rush out and do them before it’s too late. Well, thanks to outsourcing, you don’t have to waste time on these, either. TaskRabbit is a great example of an online outsourcing marketplace for those small, unforeseeable tasks – a quick run for groceries, for instance, or a sprint to get your computer or car fixed. Here’s how the author put this service to use: His nephew, who lives in Los Angeles, wanted a slide for his second birthday. The author, who lives in New York, used TaskRabbit to contract a person in Los Angeles to purchase the slide at an IKEA in Long Beach, take it to his nephew’s parents’ house and assemble it. A truly unforgettable gift – all for $47. In the first blink, we learned about the value of tracking things like your time and dietary habits. However, it’s not always beneficial to spend loads of time tracking everything. Trying to track your finances, for example, often results in strain and stress. Keeping tabs on what and where you spend is a challenge, especially when you have several bank accounts and credit cards, not to mention things like loans, mortgages and stocks and bonds. So why not take advantage of some new tools and cut the time spent agonizing over your budget? Mint.com is a great tool for organizing your finances and keeping track of your financial health. Just provide Mint.com with your details and logins for bank accounts, loans and credit cards, and they’ll let you know via email when a balance is dipping toward the red, or if there’s been a big deposit or withdrawal from an account, as well as making sure that you’re getting paid. Mint.com can also provide a categorized and comprehensive overview of your financing that allows you to see how you spend your money and time. Mint.com can even use your previous spending patterns to suggest budgets for you! Another innovative new tool to help you stop stressing and start saving is BillShrink. BillShrink simply asks for a few personal details: your checking account information, your driving habits, how often you use your cellphone and how much you spend on other services, such as movie streaming and magazine subscriptions. Based on this information, Billshrink outlines cost-effective alternatives and outlines how much these alternatives would help you save over a two-year period; they also alert you to new deals and offers. But don’t be shocked if you find you could be saving more than you realized: when the author used BillShrink for the first time, he realized he could save around $14,000 in two years! We’ve all been there: a desk seething with piles of paper; a floor only traversable via a narrow path through a chaos of stuff. And surrounded by all that stuff, you can never find exactly what you need when you need it. But there’s no need for this headache! You can overcome it simply by setting limits for yourself. Start off by setting an upper limit. This will help you locate and keep track of your possessions. Take the author’s electronic gear stash, which once occupied an entire closet. Over time, though, the closet became overcrowded, and finding a specific cable meant dragging the whole mess out of the closet and onto the floor. The author realized things had gotten out of hand, and decided to take action. So he bid his electronics goodbye and sold off most of his gear on Ebay. What was left fit into one box, which became the upper limit. If he buys a new piece of electronic gear, some other piece has got to go. This way, his stash is manageable, tidy and he can always find what he needs. Just as you can use upper limits to control things that you might be overindulging in (like perusing Facebook, perhaps), you can also make sure you’re doing more of the things that lift your quality of life, such as exercising, meditating and traveling. How? By setting lower limits. The author, for example, has set a lower limit of at least one trip every month, at least 30 miles of running per week and cooking meals at home at least three days a week. By setting lower limits for your leisure time in this way, you’ll make sure your time doesn’t always get gobbled up by work. Have you ever had the frustrating experience of just getting into something – and then being interrupted by a distracting text or email? It ruins your focus and now you’re irritated to boot. Well, there’s a way to keep your focus from being destroyed like this: batching.  Batching is the simple process of grouping similar tasks together and completing them in batches, instead of one at a time, here and there. This way, it’s easier to focus on what you’re doing right now.  Some people use batching by deciding that they’ll only answer emails during the first 10 minutes of every hour, instead of replying as they arrive. The author pays all his bills for the week on Fridays, instead of paying them as they come in. Of course, when you start batching, you learn exactly how much time certain things take up. Take note when things seem to be taking longer than they should, as this tells you that you might need to optimize. A great place to start is by getting rid of unnecessary paperwork. Sure, there’s a lot of talk about living in a paper-free society, but everyday we still find ourselves dealing with pesky papers. Which is why online tools are around: to help us eliminate paperwork even further. If you ever have to send a document via snail mail, Postal Methods can help you out. All you have to do is upload your document. The company prints it for you, puts it in a stamped envelope and then sends it on its way in the mailbox. This saves you a lot of time, and who likes licking stamps, anyway? It’s as simple as this: getting enough shut-eye and eating healthy determines how much energy you will have to do the things you want to do. No amount of productivity apps in the world can change this! When you deprive yourself of sleep, your body starts producing a rather unpleasantly named hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin increases hunger and lowers levels of another hormone, leptin, which regulates metabolism. When our metabolism doesn’t function properly, we will inevitably get tired. If you want to improve your sleep, there are two simple steps that will help. Firstly, take D-vitamins with your breakfast each day. Secondly, avoid devices emitting blue light, such as TVs, iPads and computers in the hour before you go to bed. Starting to live more healthily is also simple. Just eliminate fats, right? Wrong. A lot of people still see fat as the enemy, but sugar is the real villain here. Our brains can’t function without fat, whereas too much sugar prevents us from absorbing vitamins A, D, E and K. So, no more wasting your time on processed foods and sweets! Start seeking out natural options and increasing your intake of the “good” fats found in olive oil and avocados. Once you’ve made sure you’re sleeping enough and eating well, it’s time to start thinking about getting your body moving. Claiming that you’re too stressed to exercise is simply no excuse! The truth is that exercise reduces stress, and you’ll find that a good fitness program will allow you to cope better and better each day. Design your own exercise regimen to include three types of movement. First, there should be a strength and skill component – something like rock climbing or parkour will do the trick. Second, include high-intensity interval training – a short interval of exerting yourself to the maximum, followed by an interval of active rest. And, finally, you should engage in some kind of mobility training – something like yoga or just a good old-fashioned stretching session. The key message in this book: Though life today seems to be stress-filled, there are ways to cut through the clutter and own your hours. With simple techniques and innovative new tools and services to guide you, you’ll be saving time for the things you love in no time at all.  Actionable advice: De-clutter your inbox! Use your e-mail service’s filter to automatically put all e-mails that have the term “Unsubscribe” and don’t have “FW” or “RE” in them in a folder called Optional. This will weed out a lot of non-essential and distracting e-mails from your inbox that you can look at later once you’ve got time.

If we’re honest with ourselves, though, we’ll see that the culprit isn’t just the modern world; it’s also ourselves. We often make ourselves busier than we have to be. Then, when we’re done being busy, we spend the rest of our time glued to social media, television and email! To regain our time and pursue the activities and projects we’ve been putting on the backburner, the solution, it would seem, is simple: stop being busier than we have to be, and avoid the distractions that are whittling our days away. Of course, these things are much easier said than done. If we want a real fighting chance of doing them, we’re going to need to understand the underlying causes of busyness and distraction. Then, we must implement a strategy to overcome them. To bring that strategy to life, we’ll need some practical tactics. Over the course of these blinks, we’ll look at why we’re so busy and distracted, why productivity and willpower alone aren’t enough to solve the problem and how to develop a four-step strategy to regain our time. To implement that strategy, we’ll then look at a sampling of 20 of the authors’ 87 time-making tactics, which you can use to create a personalized approach to taking back your life. In these blinks, you’ll learn the identities and hidden nature of the dynamic duo of time-wasting super villains: the Busy Bandwagon and the Infinity Pool; why striving to be more productive can make you feel like you’re just running faster on a hamster wheel; and a nifty trick for avoiding caffeine crashes. Why do we feel like there’s never enough time to do the things we really want to do? The simple answer would seem to be that there’s just too much to do on any given day – too many emails to answer, too many meetings to attend, too many Facebook posts to keep up with. But that’s only partially true. The full truth is that our lack of time is, to some extent, self-imposed. There are two phenomena at work here. The first is the Busy Bandwagon. This is the modern mindset that tells us that we must squeeze as much work as possible into every moment of the day. It urges us to be constantly productive, resulting in overloaded inboxes, jam-packed calendars and never-ending to-do lists. The second phenomenon is the rise of Infinity Pools. Unless you’ve been hiding in an underground bunker for the past decade, you’re most likely already familiar with these. Think Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Netflix and news websites. Instantly available with a mere tap of the screen or click of the mouse, they’re essentially apps and other digital sources of limitless, inexhaustible, constantly-replenishing content – whether it be information, entertainment or a bit of both. As anyone who has encountered them knows first-hand, these Infinity Pools can be quite the time wasters – and statistics back this up. On average, we spend four hours watching television and another four hours staring at our smartphones per day – the equivalent of a full-time job! Now, combine that second job with our actual full-time jobs, which are hectic enough by themselves and often spill into our non-work hours because of the Busy Bandwagon. Well, it’s clear where all the time goes, right? What’s worse is that the Busy Bandwagon and Infinity Pools have joined forces to become a tag-teaming duo of time destroyers. Exhausted by the Busy Bandwagon, we’re easily enticed into plunging into the Infinity Pools and passively soaking up their content. The result is endless tasks and endless distractions, with us bouncing back and forth between the two all day long – day in, day out. So, the question is: How do we escape? Well, that’s what the rest of these blinks are all about! First, we’ll look at what not to do. Then, we’ll look at what to do. As the Busy Bandwagon careens down the road of modern life, it’s followed by a procession of gurus hawking various organizational systems, each promising you a more productive way of getting your work done. The thinking behind these systems follows a pretty simple formula. You have a certain quantity of work to do; let’s call it X. If X amount of work fills up all of your time, then the solution seems simple: do X faster to have more spare time! Unfortunately, X is a variable, rather than a constant, so things aren’t that simple. In today’s always-asking-for-more world, there’s an endless series of tasks we could be doing, so whenever you finish one task, it gets replaced by another. You empty your inbox; another email appears. You field one request; a colleague makes another. Consequently, you can rush through your to-do list as quickly as possible, hoping to reach the mythical endpoint, but the ink on your last check mark will barely be dry before another item materializes. The more you get done, the more you find to do. It’s like chasing a carrot on a hamster wheel. You can run faster and faster, but you’ll never reach it, because the wheel just spins faster and faster too. More productivity thus leads to more busyness. It also reinforces the mentality that got you on the Busy Bandwagon in the first place. By focusing so much on getting through your to-do list as quickly as possible, you’re not just setting yourself up for failure by giving yourself an impossible task, but you’re also putting busyness on a pedestal. And you’re putting yourself on the back-burner. To see why, think about where the tasks on your to-do list come from. Are they things you would choose to do if you were left to your own devices? For the most part, no. They’re things that others have imposed on you. They’re other people’s priorities, not yours. By prioritizing them, you’re deprioritizing yourself. And as you subordinate yourself to other people’s priorities, you lose time and energy for your own passions and projects. You end up postponing them to “another day,” which never comes. Exhausted by running on the hamster wheel of productivity, making no further progress toward your true callings, you’ll be especially prone to falling into the Infinity Pools of distraction, which we’ll turn to next. If you don’t want to get stuck in an Infinity Pool of distraction, like Facebook or Twitter, couldn’t you just refrain from entering the pool in the first place? Use your willpower and just say no? Unfortunately, the idea of “just saying no” is wishful thinking. Infinity Pools have been expertly designed to overpower your resistance and suck you into their endless content. The companies that make them have a vested interest in doing so. The more you use their apps, the more money they make. Armies of talented, well-meaning techies jump into action, using complex data measurement techniques to see what captures your eyeballs. Because it’s much easier to redesign and relaunch an app than, say, a car, they can churn through iterations of their app until they find the one that’s most irresistible. But don’t get too mad at them or at the tech company executives. Motivated by a genuine love for technology and the pressure of a hyper-competitive industry, they’re just trying to do their jobs. You can blame your ancestors instead. Infinity Pools are just taking advantage of how our brains were evolutionarily hardwired in prehistoric times. Back then, it paid for us to be distractible. Keeping us on the lookout for sudden changes in our environments, like a rustling bush, prevented us from getting eaten by a saber-toothed tiger! In those days, we lived in tight-knit tribes, so it also paid to be fascinated by stories, gossip and social status, which could help us learn from each other, keep abreast of tribal news and know our place in the tribal pecking order. Finally, going out to hunt mastodons or gather berries meant never knowing exactly when or where you might get lucky, so our brains evolved to be motivated by unpredictable rewards. That way, even if a particular valley or patch of shrubs proved mastodon- or berry-less, we’d keep searching for food. Back then, these predispositions served us well. But today, they make us prey to phone notifications that grab our attention, clickbait headlines that intrigue us with stories, Tweets that relay gossip, Instagram follower counts that quantify our social status and endless Facebook feeds that promise the unpredictable rewards of interesting links hidden between boring posts. The combination of expertly-designed apps and prehistorically-shaped minds is too powerful for us to resist by willpower alone. We need strategies and tactics, which we’ll turn to next! If willpower alone isn’t enough to defeat Infinity Pools, and if productivity just makes the Busy Bandwagon stronger, how do we escape their clutches? Well, as with vanquishing a supervillain, the answer lies in identifying the ultimate source of their superpower and taking it away from them. That source can be summarized in one word: reactivity. Both the Busy Bandwagon and Infinity Pools derive their power from our being unmindfully reactive to external stimuli. A colleague emails you with a question, and you feel obligated to respond to it immediately. Your phone buzzes with a notification, and you feel compelled to look at the screen. You do these things without even thinking about them – and that’s precisely the problem. Riding the Busy Bandwagon and wallowing in Infinity Pools have become our automatic behavioral reactions to professional demands and digital technologies. If we think of our minds as computers and our behaviors as a program, we could say that unmindfully reactive behaviors have become our default settings. At the beginning of each day, this is how we’re already set up to respond to the stimuli of demands and technology we’ll encounter. This is similar to how, when you turn on your phone for the first time, it defaults to sending you certain notifications, displaying a certain background and playing a certain ringtone. If you know how to operate a phone, you know how to reprogram its default settings to change the notifications, background and ringtone to your liking. In the following blinks, we’ll look at how to reprogram your own default settings in order to stop being unmindfully reactive, which leads to falling into the traps of the Busy Bandwagon and Infinity Pools. You might be wondering, where are we heading with all this? Well, if the problem with our default settings is unmindful reactivity, then its antidote is the opposite: mindful proactivity. We’ll start looking at what this is and how to cultivate it in the next blink. In Homer’s Odyssey, Odysseus faces his own version of Infinity Pools: the Sirens. They are winged creatures whose bewitching voices lured sailors into crashing into the rocks from which they sang. Sailing toward them, Odysseus was mindful of his own limitations. He knew he couldn’t resist the sirens by sheer willpower. Wanting to hear the Sirens’ songs, but not wanting to crash into the rocks, Odysseus came up with a simple but brilliant solution. He proactively tied himself to the mast of his ship and made his sailors put beeswax in their ears, so they couldn’t react to the Sirens’ song. That’s the simplest way to explain being mindfully proactive: think and act like Odysseus. The Busy Bandwagon and Infinity Pools can be as irresistible as the Sirens. However, like Odysseus, we can create barriers between us and them that prevent their songs from luring us in or even reaching us in the first place. There are simple but powerful tactics you can employ to create these barriers. We’ll get into this more specifically later, but for now, here’s just one example: Avoid the temptation of scrolling through Facebook simply by setting up a website blocker! At this point, maybe you’re thinking, “enough already, just tell me the tactics!” Well, hold on just a little longer, because it wouldn’t do any good to just list a bunch of tips and tricks. That’s because tactics by themselves are not enough. You need a strategy to guide them. That’s especially true here, because there’s no one-size-fits-all set of tactics that’s going to work for everyone. Each person is different, and you need a set of tactics molded to the contours of your specific personality. The strategy that comes next will enable you to find the set of tactics that works for you. In its broad outlines, this strategy is very simple and can be broken down into four steps: highlight, focus, energize and reflect. In the following blinks, we’ll go through each of these steps, and by the end, you’ll be ready to find the tactics through which you can avoid the modern Sirens that lure you into wasting your time. As you’ve seen, just being more productive doesn’t solve the problem of being too busy. In fact, because your to-do list is never-ending, it can make the problem even worse by feeding into the Busy Bandwagon. You’re not going to save yourself time to do what you really want to do by giving yourself more and more short-term tasks. It also doesn’t work to get as much done as possible or to neurotically manage your schedule to complete tasks as efficiently as possible. Instead, you’re just going to make yourself more busy, which makes your days fly by in a blur and leaves you exhausted by the time you’re done with work and chores – hardly ready to, say, write the novel you’ve always wanted to write or spend some quality time with your family. If focusing on the accomplishment of short-term tasks isn’t the solution, then perhaps it is about the long-term goals. But these aren’t much help either. They’re too abstract, too removed from the here and now, too focused on the distant future. Now, none of this is meant to discourage to-do lists, schedules, tasks and goals. Long-term goals help you orient your journey in life. To-do lists, schedules and short-term goals help you keep track of your progress and get things done along the way. They’re important, but they’re just not enough to help you regain your time. There is a sweet spot between your short-term and long-term goals: A goal that you can focus on today but that can also serve as your guiding star as you navigate it. This is a daily highlight – a sustained activity or project that you’ll be able to look back on with satisfaction at the end of the day. You may have been asked some version of this question before: What was the highlight of your day? Instead of waiting until the end of the day to see what the answer is, come up with an answer ahead of time by tweaking it slightly: What do you want the highlight of your day to be? Of course, that question is easier to ask than to answer. Next, we’ll look at some ways you can help yourself answer it. Like Neapolitan ice cream, highlights come in three basic flavors: important, meaningful and joyful. Each entails its own approach, so let’s go through them one-by-one. For the first approach, ask yourself, “what – if anything – is my most urgent, absolutely necessary activity or project today?” To find these highlights, take a look at your to-do list, your email inbox or your calendar. Maybe you have a client expecting a proposal today, or your daughter needs help with her costume for Halloween tonight. Now, let’s say you need to fill out a ten-minute form today. By all means, finish the form – but don’t make it your highlight! For a highlight, you want something that takes about 60 to 90 minutes. Shorter activities don’t give you enough time to get in the zone. For longer ones, you’re unlikely to be able to sustain your focus. For the second approach, ask yourself, “what’ll make me feel the most satisfied at the end of the day?” This is purely about what you want to do, not what you need to do. Prime candidates for this type of highlight are projects you’ve been wanting to get around to, but keep postponing because they aren’t time sensitive. You’ll usually get this satisfaction from something that is either an outlet for a skill you want to use, or accomplishes something that’s important to you. For example, maybe there’s a pet project at work you’ve been itching to get started, or perhaps you want to research potential destinations for that vacation you keep thinking about. The third approach is to ask yourself, “what will bring me the most joy?” The point of becoming less unmindfully reactive and more mindfully proactive isn’t to construct some sort of perfectly planned day with a goal-obsessed mentality, it’s to live a fuller and more joyful life. To live that life, sometimes you just need to let loose and do something simply because you enjoy doing it, whether it be learning how to play a new song on the guitar or reading a book. Whatever floats your boat, give yourself permission to do it! So those are the three flavors of highlights and their respective approaches. Which one do you take? Every day, you should trust your gut and choose whichever one feels right to you. You might still need assistance with choosing your highlights. In a moment, we’ll look at some potentially helpful tactics. But first, let’s go over some advice on how to implement them. In a nutshell, don’t try doing all of these tactics at once. You’ll get overwhelmed and probably just give up. That’s because there are way too many tactics to do in one go! Moreover, you’re not meant to do all of them, you’re just supposed to try some of them out. See which ones do and don’t work for you then keep the ones that work and get rid of the rest. Now let’s move on to our first round of tactics. Some of these are self-explanatory, so we’ll just pass over them quickly. Others, we’ll examine more closely. As a first tactic for finding your highlight, you can write down a list of your priorities and then rank them to remind yourself of which one is your highest priority. Ask yourself, “how can I pursue this today?” If you’re torn between two potential highlights, you can use your ranked list to break the tie. As a second tactic, you can repeat yesterday's highlight if you didn't get to it, didn't finish it, want to establish a new skill or habit or simply enjoyed it so much that you want to do it again! Third, you can combine a bunch of little, nagging tasks into a one big, composite task. There’s a two-fold bonus to this tactic. First, it gives you the satisfaction of feeling caught up with tasks that have been weighing on you. Second, by giving you the confidence that you’ll get around to them someday, these non-urgent tasks can pile up without constantly vying for your attention, thus putting the breaks on the Busy Bandwagon. As another tactic, you can look at your to-do list, and do the task that matters most to you. Finally, you can choose a highlight that's a longer project, break it into steps and string those steps into a multi-day highlight. Hopefully, you’ll have a highlight by the end of one of these tactics. Now, it’s time to actually do it, which is the subject of the next blink. It’s one thing to come up with a not-too-little, not-too-big goal and declare, “today, this will be the highlight of my day.” It’s another to get around to actually doing it. For that, you need to make time for your highlight. Here are some tactics that can help. You can estimate how long your highlight will take to accomplish and schedule it into your day. Or, go one step further and block off a regular space of time on your schedule for doing highlights. Or, go two steps further and break down your day into a detailed schedule – perhaps even half hour by half hour, writing in simple things like “drink coffee.” This may allow you to get as much time out of your day as you can – just you make sure you write in your highlight and not just your tasks! Alternatively, if you can, shift around your commitments or get out of them to make space in your schedule. If you shift around some meetings, you might regain a surprising amount of time. Finally, to reclaim time for yourself at the beginning or end of each day, you could either become a morning person or a more effective night person. That means someone who doesn’t just start puttering around on Facebook or YouTube when the hour gets late. These last two tactics are easier said than done, so some further advice is warranted. To become a morning person, it helps to use light to replicate the conditions of our ancestors’ lives – falling asleep at sunset and waking up with dawn. To mimic this, dim the lights of your home a couple of hours before going to bed, switch your screened devices to night mode and turn them off when you’re in the bedroom. Be sure to go to bed early enough to still get enough sleep before you wake up early the next day, which you can then facilitate by providing yourself with plenty of light. This can be supplied by a dawn simulator – a device that gradually bathes you with brighter and brighter light in the morning. As for becoming a more effective night owl, try setting aside time for your highlight in the late evening or early night. Before the time arrives, do something that recharges you, and then, when it’s time for the highlight, log off social media to keep focused. How do you recharge yourself, stay offline and keep yourself focused? We’ll look at that next. Now that we’ve seen some ways to make time for our highlights, let’s look at some tactics for staying focused on them, avoiding distractions and actually making use of that time. First, you can delete Infinity Pool cellphone apps like Twitter and Facebook. Don’t worry, you’ll still have access to your maps, music and the other useful apps. For more extreme measures, you can even delete your phone’s email app. This might sound crazy, but think about it: How often do you actually write an email reply on your phone, with its tiny, cumbersome keyboard? Probably not that often. Your email app mostly just functions as an anxiety-provoking notification app. So try getting rid of it. Alternatively, install software and website blocking programs to limit the amount of time you can use social media or email on your computer. You can also try a more moderate measure: Log out of your social media accounts. That way, when you feel the impulse to check them, you’ll have to enter your login credentials. The extra little hassle will discourage you from using social media unnecessarily, and it will give you a moment to stop and think about if you really want to be doing this with your time. Also, instead of keeping up with the news on a daily or even hourly basis, you can catch up on it once per week. Yes, you’ll be a little out of the loop. But how much does the news you read give you information about decisions you actually have to make in the here and now? Can’t most of it wait a week? Some of it is actually pressing, but you’ll probably hear about these stories one way or another, whether at the proverbial water cooler or in a text message alert informing you that the volcano is about to blow. Moreover, when you have a random, fleeting question, like “who’s that actress on that TV show?” write it down on a piece of paper and save it for later, instead of immediately Googling it. That way, you’ll be able to avoid going down a Google rabbit hole of one follow-up question after another, while also feeling secure that you can still do your very “important” research later! Hopefully, some of these tactics will help you avoid distractions. Unfortunately, even if they do help, they won’t be of much use if you’re too tired to use the time they make available. The next blink covers ways to keep yourself energized. In the modern world, people often act as if the mind were separate from the body, as if the body’s purpose were to carry around the mind. Meanwhile, you busy yourself primarily with the mental tasks of contemporary life, such as navigating computer screens. Of course, anyone with a body knows this isn’t true. Whenever you feel mentally sluggish after eating too much food or clear-minded after exercising, you experience the connection between the mind and body firsthand. So it’s clear that caring for the one requires caring for the other. If you want an energized mind, you need to look after your body – but how? There’s so much conflicting advice out there. How do you sort through it all? Fortunately, most of the things you need to know are pretty simple and come straight from human prehistory. Looking at the lifestyles of our ancestors, you see some simple but important factors behind their healthiness: a varied and sparse diet, a sleeping schedule that mirrors the rhythm of the day, plenty of social interaction and nearly constant low-key movement like walking, punctuated by bursts of more intense activity like lifting heavy objects. That’s how humans lived for 188,000 of their 200,000 years on Earth, up until the agricultural revolution about 12,000 years ago. Humans are still built for doing all of the things just mentioned, but the defaults of modern life no longer encourage them. Instead, they encourage you to sit around, watch screens, eat processed food and squeeze in sleep. As a result, lifestyles are no longer in sync with physical needs, and so bodies – and therefore brains – suffer the consequences, which are considerable. Besides the obvious health risks, you’re more prone to getting distracted and losing time when you’re low on energy, whereas you feel ready to tackle nearly anything when you’re energized. The key to taking care of your body is to return to the principles underlying our ancestors’ way of life while retaining the benefits of modern life. This isn’t about adopting an extreme paleo diet or anything like that, but about making your evolutionarily-shaped needs more in sync with your societally-shaped lifestyles. The next blink looks at some tactics that can help you do that. Like the key factors of our prehistoric ancestors’ lifestyles, the tactics for taking care of our minds and bodies can be broken down into four categories: exercise, diet, social connection and sleep. We’ll look at one or two tactics for each of these. For exercise, remember that we don’t need to do a triathlon or anything extreme like that. Just 20 minutes of modest, daily activity, such as running or swimming, is scientifically proven to have important benefits for our cognitive abilities, mood and overall health. And if we’re really short on time, we don’t even need 20 minutes. Recent research suggests that we can experience even greater benefits from seven minutes of high-intensity interval training than from an hour of gentle exercise. In as little as 5 to 10 minutes, we can squeeze in quite a re-energizing workout by combining sprints, push-ups, pull-ups, squats and lifting weights. Regarding diet, eat real food in moderation, like our ancestors did: plants, nuts, fish and meat. Here’s a simple trick for making serving sizes smaller without feeling smaller: put salad on your plate first, right in the middle. Then add the rest of the meal around it. This way, the whole plate will be filled up, but mostly with greens. Also, caffeine crashes can be devastating to our energy levels. To avoid them, try re-caffeinating about 30 minutes before a crash, which is often after lunch. If we wait until we’ve already crashed, it’s too late. The biochemical principles at play here are a little complicated, but the bottom line is that we have to reinforce the old caffeine with new caffeine before an army of drowsiness-inducing molecules called adenosine can sweep in and win the battle over the brain. For sleep, avoid the temptation to catch up on it. This messes up our internal clock, which disrupts our sleep schedule. Stick to it. Wake up at the same time every day – even weekends. For social connection, remember that like our prehistoric ancestors, who lived in small, tight-knit tribes, we have an innate need to socialize. In today’s world, our “tribe” is our friends, colleagues and extended family. Hanging out with any of these people can help fulfill our need for connection – but some of them are especially good at lifting our spirits. Spend time with these people in particular. Better yet, share a healthy meal with them – and put the phones away. That way, multiple goals can be accomplished at once: connecting with our tribe, eating well, avoiding Infinity Pools and getting off the Busy Bandwagon. In total, these blinks have given you 20 tactics for implementing the first three steps of the Make Time strategy: highlight, focus and energize. That’s a lot of tactics to try out! With so many tactics to choose from, you might feel overwhelmed. Even if you remember the advice about just trying out one new tactic at a time, it might still feel like there’s so much you’re not covering. Here’s one way of fighting that feeling. Think of the tactics as recipes in a cookbook, and the first three steps of the strategy as breakfast, lunch and dinner. Each day, you try out just one recipe per meal, at most. You wouldn’t feel compelled to cook your way through an entire cookbook, and you shouldn’t feel that way about these tactics either! The point of a cookbook is just to give you options to try. You pick and choose the ones that fit your needs. You test them, taste the results and go from there. The same holds true of the “recipes” provided by these tactics. The point is simply to see which ones work for you – so test them out and then observe, record and analyze the results. To do this, simply take a few moments every day to note what your highlight was, whether you made time for it, which tactics you used, what worked and didn’t work about them, what changes you could make and which tactics you’ll use tomorrow. This is the last step of the Make Time strategy. To further keep track of how you’re doing, you can also rate your focus and energy levels on a scale of 1 to 10. And to add a positive spirit to the whole endeavor, you can write down a moment for which you feel grateful. That way, you’ll be attuned to the positive developments that you may see in your life. If all goes well, these developments will be considerable. They’ll give you more time, energy and focus for the activities, projects and people you really care about. By freeing yourself up to pursue them, you may even rediscover an old passion or discover a new one. Perhaps you may pursue your career with renewed vigor. Or perhaps one of your projects or hobbies will blossom into a brand new calling. That’s exactly what happened to the authors. One of them left Google to become a writer. The other left YouTube to pursue sailing. Where will your journey take you? There’s only one way to find out, and that’s to begin! The key message in these blinks: The main reasons we feel like we never have enough time are the Busy Bandwagon and Infinity Pools: the ethos that encourages busyness for its own sake and the apps that keep us distracted with endless communication and entertainment. Productivity and willpower alone are not enough to overcome these two forces of time wastage. Instead, we need a mindful, proactive strategy to deal with them. To that end, you can use a variety of tactics to implement a four-step strategy of choosing a daily highlight, focusing on it, energizing yourself and reflecting on the results.  Actionable advice: Start implementing this strategy today.  Review these blinks, select one tactic for each of the first three steps and start choosing a highlight, focusing on it and energizing yourself today! Got feedback?

Glei","summary":"Manage Your Day-To-Day is a compilation of the insights gained from 20 creative minds across various fields. In reading about these famous creatives, you will learn the tricks that they personally use to manage their time, create effective work routines and nurture their creativity. In addition, you’ll see just how easy it is to adapt these principles and techniques to your daily life. Even the simplest tweaks can make your work all the more effective, help you to be more conscientious of how you use technology and ensure that creative blocks won’t set you back. After reading these blinks, you’ll know how flossing your teeth can actually make you more productive; why you should never respond to any emails before lunchtime; and why cultivating a garden can lead to your next creative breakthrough. If you’re like most people, then the first thing you do when you get to the office is check your email. While this might seem like a good idea, starting your day with this simple task can actually reduce your overall productivity. Our bodies follow what’s called a circadian rhythm, whereby our energy levels wax and wane throughout a 24-hour period. These rhythms cause us to be more effective in the morning and we should therefore reserve that time for important or difficult tasks. When we get to work and see an inbox full of unread messages, it’s tempting to try to immediately resolve the stress of knowing that someone is waiting for our response by answering those emails. But answering emails is a simple task that doesn’t require much thought or creativity. What’s more, responding to emails or phone calls in the morning causes you to use your most effective time working on other people’s priorities. And when you finally get around to working on your own projects, you’ll find yourself fatigued and less efficient. That’s why creative coach Mark McGuinness suggests that you devise a work routine that allows you time to start your day with your own projects: make it a rule not to respond to any emails before your own creative work is done. In addition, you should make sure to take breaks and get enough sleep in order to maximize the body’s available energy. How much sleep is enough? While it’s hard to say, consider that only 2.5 percent of the population feels comfortable getting less than seven hours of sleep. So, if you’re like most, you should devise a routine that allows for at least seven hours of sleep every night, rather than relying on an extra cup of coffee. And don’t forget to also include breaks in your new work routine: studies have shown that we can maintain peak function for only about 90 minutes at a time. So make sure to pause and relax regularly so that you can recharge. Doing creative work when you aren’t feeling creative can be difficult. Unfortunately, we don’t always have the luxury of waiting until we’re in the right mood. But rather than relying on your mood, you can build a routine that facilitates creativity, no matter how you feel that day. Essentially, if you work regularly, then you will get regular inspiration. When working on creative projects, many people feel that they can’t work every day because they don’t have enough inspiration. But this simply isn’t true! In fact, as outlined by author Gretchen Rubin, working every day on creative projects – even if it’s only for half an hour – can help you develop many fresh ideas. By making it a habit to work every day, you bring the project into your daily life, and allow yourself to find inspiration even in completely unrelated situations. Indeed, ideas can pop up when you least expect it. For example, you might finally find a great color scheme for your project, but only after your friend showed you her brand new neon-green sneakers. Because the project was always on your mind, you found inspiration in an unexpected place. What’s more, working regularly will greatly reduce the pressure that comes with creative work. Of course, there will always be days when you feel like you can’t get anything done. However, working every day prevents the worry. For example, imagine you’re a journalist and have a deadline to finish your piece. If you start early enough and then continue to work every day, then you will have plenty of time to try out different approaches in order to find the best angle. Even when the inevitable hurdles come up, like when a source takes too long to respond or an editor rejects your draft, you’ll be less stressed, because you’ll know you have enough time still to complete it. But even working every day can’t help you too much if you are too distracted to get anything done! Our following blinks will show you how to focus in spite of the inevitable distractions. Admit it: like most people, you struggle with focusing on boring or unpleasant tasks. Unfortunately, we can’t ignore those tasks simply because we don’t like them. Luckily, author, lecturer and productivity consultant Erin Rooney Doland has two great tips to help us work through those trudging tasks. First, find ways to strengthen your will power at work by training it in other areas of your life. If you work in a chaotic environment, like a crowded office, then you know how distracting it can be: it’s so tempting to take a quick break to chat with a colleague or focus your attention on things that aren’t work-related, like a Facebook message from a friend. But if you want to get anything done, you’ll need to exert control over yourself and maintain focus. If you find it difficult to do this at work, then you can practice exerting control in other situations. If you make it a habit, for instance, to floss your teeth every night, you will not only delight your dentist but also integrate a habit of self-control into your life, even when the task is boring and time-consuming. Put simply, adopting even small routines such as regular flossing can help you avoid the distractions of the workplace. Second, you can replace any non-work related negative distractions with positive ones and then reward yourself when you’re successful in doing so. Consider this study, in which children sitting alone in a room with a tasty marshmallow were given two options: eat the sweet treat right now or wait a few minutes and get two. The children’s reactions were then observed as they struggled to resist the temptation. Those who were able to wait had replaced a negative distraction, the delicious marshmallows, with  positive distractions, such as singing. In other words, they focused their attention on something other than the marshmallow. You too can use this principle to overcome negative distractions, allowing Facebook messages and water cooler chats to be a reward for hard work. If you’ve ever tried getting serious work done while watching your favorite TV show, then you must have realized how inefficient that style of work is. But why is that? In essence, we’re just not very good at multitasking. Despite this, according to psychologist Dr. Christian Jarrett, most of us believe that we’re quite adept at doing two things at once. However, we are only able to do so successfully when one of the tasks is simple and automatic, such as walking. When both tasks require our attention, then we switch our attention from one to the other, which is both time consuming and ineffective. For example, while we can walk and talk simultaneously, we can’t talk and read. This was verified in a study that showed that, when students tried to read a book while texting with a friend, it took them about 25 percent more time to read one page than students who focused completely on the reading task. So, the next time you want to try and juggle more than one task at a time, keep in mind that it won’t actually make you more productive. Quite the contrary: your work will be even less effective. To avoid this dilemma, make sure to set aside time in your day that is completely free of distractions so that you can effectively complete your work. But even if you are absolutely determined to focus only on a single task, surely other people will want you to do something. So what can you do about that? Professor Cal Newport has a great answer: set up a focus-meeting. If you need two hours to complete a task, mark it on your calendar just like you would any other meeting or appointment, and treat it the same way. This way both you and especially your colleagues know that you are unavailable during that time and you can focus solely on the project at hand. Nevertheless, the more technology becomes a part of our work, the more distracted we find ourselves! Our following blinks detail the ways in which we can manage the technology that we both need and need to control. Think about the last time you checked your phone: do you know the exact reason why you did it? Most people don’t – they absentmindedly pick up their smartphones, surf the web and check Facebook for no particular reason, and this is especially true for social media. One good way to prevent yourself from becoming absorbed in technology is to consciously think about why you’re using social media every time you use it. We tend to habitually log onto social media whenever we’re bored, looking for a distraction. The problem with this is that we never know when it’s time to stop and move on to something else. To combat this, Lori Deschene, founder of the blog tinybuddha.com, suggests that logging onto social media should always be intentional. You don’t have to ban social media entirely! Instead, you should use it meaningfully, by being fully aware of your intentions. Sure, you can log on to share the location of the restaurant where you’ve just had some amazing pizza, but just make sure to log out afterwards. This way you can continue with your real life instead of getting absorbed with what’s happening on Facebook. Parallel to this, you should consciously think about how you’re on the computer, including your posture! For many of us, going to work entails sitting in front of a computer screen all day long. But as former senior high technology executive Linda Stone observed from an alarming study, our behavior in front of the computer or smartphone screen can be highly detrimental to our health. For instance, when gazing into a computer screen, we unconsciously hold our breath or breathe in a shallow, unnatural way, which in turn contributes to stress-related diseases. One way that we can combat this, and be more mindful of how we use technology in general, is to practice yoga and other conscious breathing techniques. Smartphones, laptops, etc., were invented to make our lives easier and more pleasant, yet, it sometimes feels like we live in a science fiction movie, totally at the mercy the technologies that we ourselves create! While your smartphone doesn’t control your body, it nevertheless controls your behavior, since you just can’t live without it! You must remember that you don’t need your smartphone in every part of your life. Smartphones are so conveniently sized that it’s easy to take them with us everywhere – all you need is a pocket to keep yourself connected at all times. Author and filmmaker James Victore rightly asks whether this is really necessary. Consider, for example, how taking a phone call at dinner used to be a serious social faux pas. Today, however, it’s a completely normal occurrence. But are we okay with trading our good manners for excessive smartphone use? Just do yourself a favor and put your phone on airplane mode the next time you’re out on a date. The thing is, we can’t resist using technology if it’s available. If you want to be more effective, you’ll have to turn it off! Having a smartphone or a computer screen right next to us when we’re trying to focus is like sitting next to a plate of delicious cookies when we’re on a diet. In other words, it’s hard to resist. Unfortunately, this also means that people expect us to be available at all hours of the day, no matter what. This expectation is such a problem that Professor of Psychology Dan Ariely even suggests that the IT team at your company delays the delivery of email until a certain time of the day, as to prevent you from being constantly bombarded. While a company-wide process such as Ariely’s suggestion may not happen, you could just turn off all your devices or even just go to another room when you really need to focus. So far, we’ve mostly focused on preventing distractions so that you can maximize your available creativity. These final blinks deal with boosting your creative resources. What do you usually do when you have a bit of spare time? Likely, you don’t spend it sitting around doing nothing, right? But you ought to! Having time in which you “do nothing” is essential for becoming and staying creative – especially if you’re stuck with a creative block. Whenever you’re stuck on something, being alone and letting your mind wander can bring back your creativity. This feels quite counterintuitive, but it’s true: if you think about nothing in particular, you will necessarily become more aware of your thoughts and surroundings, which then provide a great source for creativity. Scott Belsky, the Vice President of Adobe, suggests that you set aside a certain time in your day to simply let your mind wander without focusing on anything in particular. If this feels difficult to you, then start by thinking about what you’ve learned and what your immediate plans are and then let your mind wander from there. In addition, striving for perfection can also lead to creative blocks. Indeed, some of us are never happy with our accomplishments unless they embody perfection – but honestly, this rarely ever happens. We should all take the advice of author Elizabeth Grace Saunders: stop being a perfectionist and let creativity be your guide! If you’re a perfectionist, then you surely know how difficult it is just to start a project, waiting impatiently until that ideal moment when you’ll get the most amazing ideas. But if that moment doesn’t arrive, you’ll have to start anyway, and then you’ll feel uncomfortable and even less creative. A far better approach is to start your projects immediately, even if you don’t feel like it. This way, you’ll have something to start with and improve upon later. Even if you don’t feel creative right at the beginning, you’ll soon see your creativity kick in. Surely you know how difficult it can be when you have to come up with creative ideas under pressure. As we’ve seen before, creativity isn’t something that you can just will into motion. Luckily, there are things you can do outside of work to boost your creativity: For example, if you take time to exercise and get a good rest, you’ll find that you are more creative afterwards. As we’ve already learned, rest and sleep are important ingredients for a productive lifestyle. By the same token, they are also essential for generating creative ideas. In fact, researchers at Harvard University found that people who got adequate sleep were 33 percent more likely to come up with connections between different ideas – in other words, they were more creative. In addition to proper rest, bike rides or other kinds of exercise were shown to boost brain activity and therefore creativity as well. Business coach Scott McDowell even advises his clients to take a nap or a brisk walk in order to get those creative juices flowing. In addition, feel free to flex your creative muscles in seemingly frivolous ways – you’ll often find that these creations can be the inspiration for amazing creative work. For example, when author Julia Cameron starts a new book, she writes a few pages of complete gibberish – just to get in the rhythm of writing. She might even find some inspiration hidden in the nonsense! Hobbies, too, are a good way to find unexpected inspiration. The founder of Accidental Creative Todd Henry suggests that people garden in their spare time and be experimental with it. Having the freedom to creatively cultivate your garden lets you create and experiment in an environment without pressure. Not only that, but hobbies like this will ensure that you won’t get bogged down by the daily grind and might even provide you with fresh ideas that you could use at work. The key message in this book: By paying attention to our natural rhythms, we can maximize our energy on our priorities and rest, exercise or do other hobbies when it’s in tune with our rhythm. Sometimes, despite what we feel like doing, we just need to focus to complete certain tasks we don’t feel like doing.

So what do these self-starters all have in common? They’ve all developed a morning regimen that helps them start the day in the best possible way. But these blinks don’t lay down inflexible rules for you to dogmatically apply to your life. Rather, they offer brilliant and unique ideas designed to inspire you to carry out your own experiments and craft a morning routine that suits your needs. So dive in and find out what kind of morning is most likely to boost your productivity and happiness. From artists who rise at the crack of dawn to record their dreams and CEOs who swear by half an hour’s meditation to Olympic athletes who can’t do without an early morning workout, there are plenty of examples to fire your imagination! In these blinks, you find out why a good night’s sleep sets you up for success; how to build a morning routine around your children; and why working out is as good for your mental health as it is for your body. You know the scene. The alarm starts ringing and you drowsily fumble in the dark to switch it off. All you want is a little more sleep. But mornings don’t have to be miserable moments of resentfully hauling yourself out of bed. One way to make sure you start the day bright-eyed and bushy-tailed is to have an important task ahead of you.   Take MIT president Leo Rafael Reif. He sets his alarm for 6:00 a.m., but he’s usually already up a good 30 or even 60 minutes before it rings. Why does he forgo the extra sleep? Well, he wants to make sure he’s had a gander at his inbox before the day gets going. That’s because MIT is a truly global institution. As its president, Reif needs to stay in the loop and make sure he’s up to speed on the latest developments. If he’s not up at the crack of dawn, he worries he’ll miss something important. But you don’t have to be the head of a large organization to give yourself a good reason to jump out of bed each morning. Knowing that something you really care about awaits you is just as good of a boost once the proverbial rooster starts crowing.   Take a leaf out of author Caroline Paul’s book. She’s also an early riser. Like Reif, she’s usually up by 6:00 a.m. What gets her out of bed? It’s the chance to spend a couple of hours reading in peace before the rest of the world begins to make itself felt. Reading isn’t just her bread and butter; it’s something she loves doing. Mornings are an oasis of calm in a hectic life, and it’s often the only chance she gets to engross herself in a good book. New York-based street photographer Andre Wagner also uses mornings to pursue his passion. He’s usually out of the house no later than 7:00 or 7:30 a.m. It’s a great time to walk the city and capture the early morning light with his camera.   But there’s also a simple trick that’ll help you get a good start: don’t use the snooze button on your alarm. The authors’ interviews with successful early risers showed that while 71 percent used an alarm, only 34 percent made use of the snooze function. There’s a good reason for that. Grabbing a few extra minutes of sleep might feel like what your body needs, but in the end, you’ll feel more tired than if you’d just gotten up when your alarm first rang. Think of it this way. Lightly slumbering is akin to revving a car engine without putting it into gear; both activities are a waste of gas. The most important tip, however, is to follow your own instincts. Experiment and see what works for you. Something that does the trick for other people might not work for you. If you realize it doesn’t, don’t be afraid to abandon it and try something else. Whether it’s a big work project or something more personal, you probably have a whole list of things you keep meaning to get around to but never seem to find the time for. There simply doesn’t seem to be enough hours in the day, right? Well, there are – you just need to snatch them in the morning. That’s often the time you’ll end up doing your most important work. Take Sheena Brady. She gets up early, so she’ll have time for her own company, Tease Tea, to which she dedicates the hours between 7:00 and 11:00, before spending the rest of the working day at Shopify. The author and public speaker Todd Henry finds mornings similarly rewarding. After he stopped trying to cram everything into the first part of his day, he created time and space to tackle the work which is most important to him – studying and writing. Mornings, he claims, are there for precisely that. Making the right start is key if you really want to get to the vital things. One way of doing that is to avoid beginning the day by checking your emails. Author Ryan Holiday aims to make sure he does at least one other task before opening his inbox. In his case, that’s writing, but you could also try other things – taking a shower, say, or going for a run. Shane Parrish, the founder of the Farnam Street blog, also adheres to this rule. He stopped checking his emails in the morning, after noticing how it let others dictate the course of his day. It’s a nifty trick. Responding to emails is, after all, reactive, whereas your morning activities should be proactive. It’s the time to take care of your own needs and schedule your day. A great way of setting your own agenda for the day is to write down a to-do list. Take Geoff Colvin, senior editor at Fortune magazine. Every morning, he sits down and writes out a list of what he wants to accomplish that day. Once he’s got his itinerary down on paper, he starts working through the tasks, beginning with the most important. But it’s also a good idea to take all this advice with a pinch of salt. Author Chris Guillebeau, for example, finds that starting his day by reading his emails suits him perfectly! Which brings us to our next blink – workout routines. Let’s not beat around the bush. Exercise is good for you. That’s something the authors’ interviewees have noticed, too – and acted on. Seventy-nine percent of them work out every day. Exercise isn’t just about toning your abs or getting into shape; indeed, it’s as good for the mind as it is for the body. Take the American Olympic swimmer and bronze medalist Caroline Burckle. She gets up at 5:30 every morning and hits the gym first thing. That’s part and parcel of the life of an athlete, but there’s more to it than that. Getting her body moving, she says, is her way of meditating. Sherry Lansing, the former president of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, admits that she occasionally skips her workout routine. That’s unavoidable sometimes. But there’s a good reason to make a concerted effort to stick to your exercise regimen. As Lansing says, when she makes working out the most important part of her morning routine, she feels on top of the world for the rest of the day. That said, you shouldn’t overexert yourself. Alternating exercises from one day to the next can prevent injuries and keep you interested and focused. Take a look at Lansing’s routine. Mondays and Wednesdays are for Pilates; Tuesdays and Thursdays are spent running on a treadmill for an hour and a half followed by weightlifting. Retired US army general Stanley McChrystal has a similar setup. A man who clearly believes that the early bird catches the worm, he gets up at 4:00 a.m. for his daily hour-and-a-half workout session. Mixing it up is a key part of his approach. That’s why he alternates between running and weight training. He noticed the benefits of that after abandoning his old habit of running the same distance every single morning. Getting started can seem daunting. It’s easy to set overly ambitious targets and end up feeling guilty because you haven’t met them. But remember: you can also start with something small and gradually increase the strenuousness of your workout routine over time. A good way of getting going is to build exercise into your preexisting routine. You could do a set of jumping jacks while you wait for your coffee to brew, for example. Julie Zhuo, the vice president of product design at Facebook, has a simple yet effective way of incorporating a workout session into her day. Rather than hitting the gym across town, she aims to spend between ten and 15 minutes on her cross-trainer each day. Because that’s not a massive amount of time, the stakes remain low. That means working out becomes as natural as brushing her teeth in the morning. Planning around your fitness regimen is another way to set yourself up for success. Take Kevin Cleary, the CEO of Clif Bar & Company. He sits down every Sunday to plan his workout routine around his work and family commitments. By resisting the temptation to set his exercise plans in stone, he frees himself up to take a more pragmatic approach. And that means he’s less likely to cancel or postpone an individual session. It’s easy to dismiss meditation as a fad, especially if you’ve never tried it. But there must be a reason over half of the authors’ interviewees regularly meditate, right? The reason so many of them swear by it is that it’s a great way to start your day. Take Michael Acton Smith, the CEO of the meditation app Calm. He heads a group meditation session at the company’s headquarters every morning. As he himself admits, that sounds dreadfully “Californian,” but it’s actually a great way to kick off the working day. Aiste Gazdar, the founder of the London-based Wild Food Cafe, agrees. Early morning meditation sessions are the most important part of her day. They’re moments of calm in which she can confront her concerns about what lies ahead. Once she’s done that, the rest of the day just falls into place.    In fact, some people are so devoted to meditating on a daily basis that they make sure they never miss a single session. The president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, Ed Catmull, meditates for around 30 to 60 minutes every day and hasn’t gone a day without doing so for years. He says that slowing down and focusing his mind sets him up to respond calmly to unexpected events. Novelist and teacher Ruth Ozeki places a similar premium on meditation. Although her schedule changes throughout the year depending on what she’s doing at any given time, she always makes time to meditate. That’s hardly surprising – she is a Zen Buddhist priest, after all. So whether she has a hectic day of teaching or a more relaxed writing day ahead of her, she meditates before doing anything else – well, almost. There is time to enjoy a cup of coffee in bed! If that sounds good, you might be wondering where to start. Meditation is all about being mindful of your surroundings and being in the moment, so a good place to jump in is by focusing your mind on mundane moments like making yourself coffee or tea in the morning. Whatever it is that you’re doing, once you’re fully focused on the task at hand, you’re already meditating. So far, we’ve focused on using morning routines to boost your productivity. But you shouldn’t neglect the person engaging in those routines – you. In fact, carving out some me time is another great way of setting yourself up for the day. Taking a moment to do things that are important to you gives you a head start on the day. And, when things begin getting a little more hectic, you’ll already be well-positioned to take them in stride. That’s what Melody McCloskey, CEO of StyleSeat, does. After getting up at 5:45 a.m., she spends the next hour or so tidying up or dealing with personal and work-related issues. By the time everyone else is up and about, she’s already firmly in her groove. And that makes her both more productive and happier for the rest of the day. But it isn’t just chores that you can make extra time for. Taking a moment to focus on anything that you value can boost your creative output. Take the artist Elle Luna. The very first thing she does upon waking is to record her dreams using a dictaphone. Dreams both provide her with an insight into her subconscious mind and serve as a source of creative inspiration. Often, she uses her recordings to help her paint her dreams. You can also follow the example of illustrator and instructor Yuko Shimizu. She takes the slow train to work to allow for five extra minutes of reading time. Whatever it is you want to do with the extra time you’ve freed up, it’s important not to dive straight into work. Slowing down your morning routine has a calming influence on the rest of the day and prevents you from becoming swamped. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at how to prepare for a great morning the evening before. You might think that morning routines are all about, well, mornings. But setting yourself up for a great start to the day is something you can actually begin planning the previous evening. A good night’s sleep is key. So how do you go about ensuring you get enough rest to start bright and early? In a word, by disconnecting. That means switching off your technological connections to the world as early as you can each evening. Take the best-selling author and entrepreneur Nir Eyal. He installed a special router that automatically cuts off his connection to the internet at around ten each evening. That means he’s usually tucked up in bed no later than eleven. Author and podcast host David Kadavy has a similar approach. He turns off the screens in his home at ten and sleeps with blue-blocker goggles to prevent LCD screens interfering with his sleep. If he’s not ready for bed, he avoids social media and instead does something quiet like reading a book. Emails are another disturbance that can prevent you winding down in the evenings. That’s why author and public speaker Jenny Blake simply doesn’t check her inbox after 5:00 p.m. It’s a technique that makes for a relaxing evening and leaves her feeling refreshed and ready to conquer the world the next morning. Reflection and quietly mulling over the course of your day can also help you disconnect and depressurize. When she hits the sack, Jenny Blake asks herself what the highlights and low points of her day were. Thinking about what she can be proud of or grateful for helps her unwind and clear her mind. Once she’s done that, she falls asleep in the blink of an eye. Math teacher and author José Luis Vilson also swears by the benefits of unwinding. His trick? A soothing cup of chamomile tea before bed. Truly disconnecting is, however, sometimes easier said than done. But little details can make all the difference. Take Bob Moore, the founder of the health-food company Bob’s Red Mill. Every evening, he lays out the clothes he plans on wearing the next day, which makes his mornings a whole lot less complicated. If you’re having a tough time getting out of bed and making a start on the day ahead, there’s usually a pretty obvious culprit – a bad night’s sleep. Sticking to a consistent bedtime can be tricky, but it’s something to strive for. After all, the amount of rest you’ve had has a greater effect on your mornings than anything else. But it’s not just your morning routine that stands to benefit from you getting a proper night’s sleep. Adequate sleep is vital to your whole sense of well-being. That’s something Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington learned the hard way. At one point, she became so sleep-deprived that she ended up fainting and breaking her cheekbone on a desk! That was the moment she decided to make some much-needed changes to her lifestyle. Today, she tries to always get eight hours of sleep, and, in order to achieve that target, heads bedward at 11:00 every night. In fact, she manages her sleep so well now that she doesn’t even need an alarm. Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic, also builds his day around getting the right amount of sleep. In his case, that means getting up as early as he can – mornings are when he’s most productive – and making sure he’s tucked up in bed by 11:00 p.m. That’s important, he says, because sleep deprivation slows your mind down. By his estimation, tiredness can knock a good ten points off your IQ score. That means it might be time to stop using an alarm to get you out of the land of Nod. At least, that’s what venture capitalist Brad Feld did. For years, he’d get up at 5:00 a.m. on weekdays, no matter where he was in the world, and he spend his weekends “catching up” on missed sleep. Unfortunately for Feld, this less-than-healthy routine resulted in a major depressive episode. After reaching that low, he changed his habits. Now he makes sure he’s getting the sleep he needs by simply slumbering away until his body is ready to wake up, which might be as early as 5:30 or as late as 9:00 a.m. So, you can see how important it is to get the right amount of sleep. Going to bed early or waking up a bit later are both options. But even if you can’t manage that, you can try to develop a consistent pattern and catch up later. If you’ve already found your perfect morning routine before having children, you’re likely to be in for a rude awakening – literally! Once you become a parent, the pattern that used to prepare you for the day ahead will probably no longer fit your life. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. Children thrive on routine just as much as adults do. The key is to make changes to your regimen so that it also works for your kids. A good way to start is with the realization that your children are alarm clocks. They’ll determine when you wake up with greater precision than your phone ever could.   Nick Bilton, a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, says he used to wake up at around 6:00 a.m. to get some work done. Now, however, he’s awakened by his toddler every morning at 5:30. That’s the new pattern. And even if the kids sleep later than usual, his dog is always on hand to make sure he’s up. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone reports a similar experience. His five-year-old wakes him between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m. each morning. That’s a cannily chosen time; it leaves exactly an hour for playtime. So if you’re a parent who wants to get something done in the morning, you’ll need to be up and about before your kids. Washington State attorney general Bob Ferguson wakes up between 5:00 and 6:30 a.m., for example. That gives him anywhere between one and two and a half hours of personal time before his twins wake up at 7:30 a.m. Whatever routine you end up choosing, remember that the most important thing is to enjoy your family time once you’re all awake. That’s especially important if, like Ferguson, you’re likely to be working late in the evenings. Whether you’re on holiday or a business trip, travel means being in new surroundings that probably lack the little creature comforts that help define your usual morning routine. That can quickly undo familiar patterns. But there are steps you can take to help you keep control of the morning. The first tip is to try to maintain at least some elements of your routine. Take model and activist Cameron Russell. She’s constantly on the road due to her work, and that’s changed the way she thinks about “routine.” For her, it’s more like an improvised attempt to fit the things she values into a hectic travel schedule; this entails a lot of adaptation and improvisation. Wherever she finds herself, she always makes time to do a little reading. That might mean skimming a few pages in the back of a cab or while sitting in the makeup chair; no matter her surroundings, though, she can’t do without this inspiring and wonderful start to the day. There are also more minimalistic solutions. Venture capitalist M. G. Siegler, for example, simply has a bottled Starbucks Frappuccino. Because the chain is nearly everywhere, he can do that whether he’s at home or abroad. But you don’t need to rely on being able to replicate your routine in every setting – in fact, there’s a lot to be said for adapting your morning ritual to wherever you currently are. That’s what Peter Balyta, president of education technology at Texas Instruments Inc., does. Using his scientific and mathematical skills, he devises a special workout routine tailored to his local surroundings. Whether it’s a jog along the Great Wall of China, applying physics know-how to leverage himself around a barbell or doing plyometric exercises using his hotel-room furniture, he’s constantly adapting his routine to what’s around him. Travel can have an adverse effect on morning routines, but remember, with a little inventiveness and flexibility, you should be able to keep up at least some of your early-hour habits. And if travel ends up knocking you off kilter, don’t worry – it happens to all of us! Just try to pick up where you left off once you’re back home. The world is an unpredictable place. That means there’ll always be some mornings where forces beyond your control end up throwing you off course and upsetting your tried-and-true morning routine. But that doesn’t have to ruin your whole day. Forewarned is forearmed. If you’re prepared for disruption, you’ll be in a much better position to go with the flow and keep your eye on the prize. Take the junior doctor Rumana Lasker Dawood. Her routine is built around disruptions. Being disrupted, after all, is what working in a hospital inevitably involves. Shifts change on a daily basis, and relocations to new specialist wards occur every half year or so. She can’t establish a regular wake-up time or plan around a definite set of daily tasks. For her, these things vary.   But she doesn’t let that throw her off course. Her demanding job has taught her to expect the unexpected and prepare accordingly. Taking events in her stride and making rapid readjustments is her routine. In fact, there’s a good case to be made that embracing adaptability and flexibility can actually help you. Look at author Austin Kleon. He’s learned to enjoy the days when his routine is disturbed; indeed, he regards such disturbances as an interesting break from his habitual schedule. Leo Babauta, the founder of the Zen Habits blog, takes this flexible approach to its logical conclusion and simply abandons routine altogether in favor of a morning ritual that emphasizes mindfulness. But, of course, you can’t diverge from or do away with your routine unless you establish one. And when developing your routine, the most important thing to remember is that it should suit your needs. Ana Marie Cox, a columnist and culture critic who has had to battle with depression, sums this up by noting that sometimes just getting out of bed can be something to be proud of. Your goal isn’t to please anyone else and end up feeling guilty if you fall short of the targets you’ve set; it’s to design a morning routine that helps you start the day well and achieve your own ambitions. The key message in these blinks: What do 64 of today’s most successful people have in common? They have a solid morning routine that sets them up for the day ahead. That’s where the similarities end, though. Every self-starter interviewed in this book has a unique morning regimen, from writing to working out to meditating. The key to developing your own morning routine isn’t any one technique or activity; it’s doing what works best for you. Actionable advice: Start right! Getting the first few hours of your day right has a dramatic effect on what comes later. You can end up feeling happier, more relaxed and ready to conquer the world. So where do you start? The best answer is by following your instincts and sticking to what feels right. Getting up at 6:00 a.m. to do an hour of meditation might sound like nirvana to some; for others, it’s more likely to be another reason to pull the duvet over their head and return to sleep. The key to successfully crafting your morning regimen is experimentation. Try out the ideas in these blinks that you like the sound of. If it feels good, stick to it. If it doesn’t, try something else. You’re sure to find your own unique combination soon enough! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s our smartphone and the eternal ping of urgent emails or our domestic life and all its attendant demands, there’s always something vying for our attention. What we sorely lack is time to relax and do what we want with our days. But, even when we do have time to ourselves, we often spend it worrying that we’re not accomplishing as much as we should, or wondering what the next item on our agenda is. So how can we create a life that’s both productive and enjoyable? To find out, we’ll need to explore why some people feel as though they have all the time in the world while others never seem to have enough. In the blinks ahead, you’ll learn why most modern workplaces have developed cultures of busyness, and why it’s now normal to have much of your free time monopolized by meaningless meetings. Furthermore, you’ll learn how you can change your attitude toward time, so that you can become more relaxed and make time in your busy life for the people that matter to you. You’ll also learn what you can do right now to feel less busy and get more done. In these blinks, you’ll find out how spending time with our loved ones can increase the amount of time we have; why creating fond memories can stretch our perception of time; and what our expectations of time have to do with our accomplishments. We may not readily admit it, but most of us have an obsession. The author, for instance, is obsessed with time, and the ways in which we pass it. She’s so obsessed, in fact, that she’s spent years logging how much time she spends on different activities. Her logbook is extremely precise. For example, she could tell you that, on Friday, July 14th, 2017 she got up at precisely 6:45 a.m., spent exactly 45 minutes on paperwork from her child’s school and later, for 30 minutes, dealt with her mail. Prior to logging her time, the author thought she had a pretty good handle on how she spent her days. Her logbook, however, quickly showed her that she had had no clue. For instance, despite often telling people she worked 50 hours a week, she was shocked to discover that she was actually averaging only 40 hours. And she’s not the only one prone to this overestimation. In 2011, a study by the Bureau of Labour Statistics found that people claiming to work more than 75 hours a week were typically overestimating by around 25 hours. Indeed, the author recently interviewed a young man who reported working 180 hours a week. An impressive accomplishment, given that this is twelve more hours than a week contains. This raises an important question: If we’re not working as much as we think we are, where is our time really going? Surprisingly, many people don’t want to know the answer to this question. Although rigorous time tracking provides a deeper understanding of how you’re actually spending each week, many of us are resistant to the idea. For starters, we may worry that tracking time will show us just how many hours we’re wasting on things that aren’t meaningful or beneficial to us or our loved ones. Second, we may fear that tracking our time will constantly remind us of our finite time on earth, which will lead to anxiety about misspending each minute. Despite these potential downsides, the author found time tracking allowed her to recalibrate her life. Armed with greater knowledge, she was able to make positive changes in how she spent her time. For instance, once she discovered she was spending almost 327 hours per year on reading trashy magazines, she became motivated to carve out time to plan her reading habits more carefully. After making lists of good books and scheduling time to buy them, she replaced her consumption of celebrity gossip with a more nourishing diet of quality titles. We all have memories, good and bad, which shape who we are today. Interestingly, our memories also play an important role in how we perceive time. In general, the more memories we make, the more time we’ll feel we’ve had. The reason comes down to how the human brain processes its environment and archives what happens in it. As we move through daily life, much of what happens to us is quickly archived in the depths of our brain, or thrown out completely. For instance, can you recall what you were doing on today’s date three years ago? Perhaps you can if something particularly noteworthy happened, but if it was a routine day like any other, you probably can’t. Why? Because we don’t think about our established routines. In fact, this lack of thought is why our routines feel so comfortable. Unfortunately, the result of this lack of thought is that our brains don’t catalogue our routine time. For instance, if you take the same work commute 235 days of the year for around four years, then your brain will typically decide to store all these commutes – approximately one thousand of them – as a single trip! And just like that, one thousand of your precious hours have been whittled down to one. Worryingly, if your brain receives too much sameness such as this, entire years can vanish into memory black holes. So how can you stretch your perception of time and avoid losing the hours to your routine? The key is to create memories that are intense or novel in some way. Taking vacations, for instance, is a surefire way to generate such memories. Our brains make memories out of novel experiences because they can’t be sure what they’ll need to remember in the future. As a result, they store everything that’s new. Therefore, if you want to stretch time, have an adventure. For example, in our everyday lives, we may well remember just a handful of interesting occurrences in the course of a fortnight. But by vacationing in an exotic place, you’ll probably obtain that number of novel experiences before you’ve sat down to breakfast. Most of us feel so busy all the time that we naturally assume every other hardworking professional must feel the same way. When scheduling a meeting with Jeff Heath, a senior director in a technology company, the author was shocked when, after asking him when he would be available for an interview, he breezily replied that he was free all week, so when was good for her? How did a senior professional have so much free time? When pressed on how he managed to keep blank spaces in his schedule, despite working in corporate America, Jeff replied that it was all thanks to his mind-set. Crucially, he avoids the mental trap that so many other professionals get caught up in. Jeff thinks that despite their lamentations about not having enough free time, most professionals actually don’t like having white space on their calendar. Why? Because having a jammed schedule gives people mental reassurance that they’re doing something productive with their time. For instance, we spend so much time in meetings because they make us feel busy and useful. According to this busy-is-good attitude, if something is scheduled at a particular time, with particular people, it’s automatically more important than unscheduled events. Imagine that a couple has arranged for a plumber to deal with a leak in their apartment. The partner who has nothing in his calendar at work that day is much more likely to stay home and let the plumber in than the partner who has several scheduled meetings. But let’s think a little deeper. Are those meetings really more important than the uninterrupted time the other partner might have spent thinking about his biggest work dilemmas? Possibly not.    Avoid this detrimental mind-set by ignoring the temptation to fill all your spare time. You don’t have to value busyness just because the world does. Don’t say yes to meetings simply because you’re theoretically available. And if you’re feeling guilty for declining them, remember that the dirty secret about meetings is that, more often than not, they take up more time than is justified by the issue they’re addressing. Don’t believe it? Just look at the meetings on your agenda and you’ll probably see that they’re all 30 minutes or an hour long, regardless of how much they need to accomplish. So say no, unless they’re genuinely important. Friends enrich our lives, make life feel less lonely and give it more meaning. But what does the time-management literature have to say about lingering with our treasured companions? A strict time-management schedule is incompatible with spending long afternoons and leisurely evenings with friends, right? It’s a common misconception that time management is incompatible with leisure time with friends. In fact, a smart way to manage your time is to make friendships your priority. Why? Because devoting more time to your important relationships not only makes you happier; it can actually create a perception of having more time.   For example, in a survey of how people spent one particular day, those who spent the most time with family and friends on this day were also most likely to report feeling that they had the most amount of time in general. Conversely, those who felt they had the least amount of time in general were also the most likely to report spending less time with family and friends during this day. Importantly, it was not the case that those with the lowest time-perception scores actually had less time than any other respondents; rather, it’s that spending time with friends and family is usually a relaxing, feel-good experience, and it therefore makes you feel as though you have all the time in the world. Time spent on, say, Twitter, won’t produce this feeling. Furthermore, in another survey, those who strongly agreed with the statement “Yesterday, I made time for my loved ones” were 15 percent more likely to also say that, generally, they had enough time in their lives for everything they wanted to do. Importantly, making time for those you care about may not only stretch your perception of time, but may also, in the long run, literally stretch your time. How? Well, research has shown that people with stronger social connections tend to have a longer life expectancy than those without such social connections. This is likely the case, because good friends and close family encourage you to look after yourself, as well as care for you when you get ill. These healthy upsides to friendships mean that, when it comes to longevity, maintaining tight relationships is approximately equivalent to stopping smoking. Like many of us, the author has a big family and a hectic life. During a recent and particularly chaotic week, she found herself thinking of those authors who seem to spend months away from their families in secluded garrets, with oodles of time to write. Why wasn’t she able to spend her time like that? Many of us have experienced this uncomfortable disconnect between our expectations and reality, but what can we do to overcome it? The best thing to do is to alter our expectations of how we should be spending our time. Importantly, once the author made a conscious effort to lower her expectations about how much she should accomplish, she seemed magically able to achieve more in the little time she did have. For instance, she found she was suddenly able to write a first draft of a magazine article in a few hours, and could edit that draft in 90-minute windows of time between other domestic commitments. How did this miracle happen? Well, when we lower our expectations of how much we can achieve, we no longer waste time worrying that we should be doing more. We often cause ourselves pain when our expectations become bigger than reality. This self-imposed suffering then leads to hours of worry about our unproductivity, which, in turn, prevents us from savoring the time we actually have. Therefore, rather than holding big expectations about all the time you should be spending on your work, the key to long-term success is to consistently set and meet low expectations. Consider the advances that a small child makes in learning language. Their development is not a matter of long hours of strict language lessons and harsh punishments for gradual progress. Rather, children advance slowly, and are praised for every new word acquired and for each minor linguistic breakthrough. To make a similar amount of progress toward our own goals, we adults should also adopt expectations of slow and gradual advancement. We each have an equal amount of time allotted to us – 168 hours a week to be exact. However, while our weeks contain the same number of hours, our bank accounts don’t contain equal funds. But where does our bank balance figure in our quest for happiness? Does money make us happy, or is it simply the case that the more money we have, the more problems we can expect? Interestingly, when it comes to money and happiness, it’s how you use your money – not how much money you have – that matters. Money can boost happiness if you use it to buy things that facilitate pleasant experiences. These experiences later become fond memories – continuous wells of pleasure from which we can draw mental sustenance. Importantly, cherished memories aren’t subject to the diminishing returns of happiness that physical objects usually are. For instance, a child given a new toy will initially be excited to play with it. After a while, though, she will likely grow bored and stop using it. In other words, it will stop bringing her joy. In contrast, if you buy a tent and then use it to go camping, that tent may bring you lasting happiness. Why? Because you will forever remember the starry nights and campfires of that trip. Additionally, if money is used to boost our happiness, we must rethink how we measure such happiness. When we consider how happy we are, we often think only of life satisfaction, which refers to how well we think our life is going in general. So, if you have a great job and a good house, you may consider yourself happy. However, this life satisfaction may not be the best measure of your happiness. Indeed, your moods are often much more driven by your hour-to-hour experiences than by your overall life satisfaction. For instance, your mood may often be depressed if you have a grueling daily commute to that dream job.   With this reality in mind, we can begin to assess which of our daily activities bring us happiness, and which make us miserable. We can then strategically use our money to either enlarge or minimize these activities. For instance, research has shown that commuting to work is often the unhappiest time of a person’s day. If this is true for you, too, then you could use your money to move closer to the office, thus reducing that commute and boosting your mood. Though this may cost a significant amount of money, it would be an important investment in your happiness. Laura Vanderkam shares five tips on how to feel less busy while getting more done. Ever feel like time just slips from one end of the hourglass to the other? No one can make more time, but a few simple strategies can make the time we have feel richer and fuller. The key message in these blinks: We all have the same amount of time each week, but our mind-set can greatly influence our perception of that time. Spending time with family and friends, and making fond memories, makes us feel as if we have more time. In contrast, worrying about our productivity and going through the motions of a boring routine can make us feel like we have less. In order to make the most of our time, it’s important to stop worrying, ditch the routine and start having adventures with those we love.  Got feedback?

Is it superior talent? Were they born advantageously?  No. Successful people come from all backgrounds and walks of life, and not every person starts out as a stellar success. But they all do share one feature – they all have awesome habits.  So what exactly are successful habits, and how do you get them, too? These blinks will explain in detail the eight ways to retrain your mind and change for the better. Even focusing on one new habit will help you go the distance when it comes to becoming more focused and productive.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why being abnormal is preferable to being normal; how multitasking is just a ruse to pretending you’re productive; and how establishing a ritual can help you to turn good behaviors into habits.  Have you ever felt the need to make a positive change in your life? Maybe you’ve already made a list of all the small things you’d like to alter. But making a long list isn’t the most effective way to go about making improvements. Why? It’s a fact that our conscious mind can only process between five to nine concepts, or pieces of information, at a time. This phenomenon is called channel capacity, and was first identified by psychologist George A. Miller in 1956. No matter what you’re reading or looking at, from words to colors or numbers, your working memory can only store a limited amount of data at any given time. And working memory is all a person has from moment to moment, whether making an argument or trying to solve a math problem. So given this limitation, it makes sense that trying to tackle too many tasks at once can be overwhelming. This also holds true when you try to change too many things at once in your life. Since every task you try to complete requires its own amount of data, your working memory can suffer from information overload when you try to juggle multiple tasks. When this happens, important data can get improperly processed and you might make a mistake, or worse, your conscious mind will shut down. You can think of this like a computer freezing when you’ve opened up too many applications. The author has witnessed this dilemma firsthand. People have told him that when they try to change two or three things in their life at the same time, they get stuck. But when they focus on only one thing, the results can be unbelievable. So the best way to improve your life and get positive results is to commit yourself to changing just one thing at a time! People may look productive when they frantically hurry from one task to the next, or by multitasking to the point of distraction. But such behavior just points to a person who has poor time management skills! The secret to having a productive tomorrow is to organize it today. Organizing effectively means prioritizing your tasks by making a list of the Three Most Important things you want to achieve. Be sure as well to include the time needed to accomplish these tasks.  Then from your three tasks, pick one that absolutely needs to be done that very day.  In doing so, you’ll be sure to focus on what’s most important to you, and will be less likely to forget or push aside a task that might be more difficult in favor of an easier goal.  Plus, by only focusing on three tasks, instead of being overwhelmed, you’ll find increased confidence in being able to accomplish all your stated goals. There are also three important things to keep in mind when making your list. First: Don’t make the mistake of listing a big, complex project as one item. Instead, find smaller and more manageable tasks within the big project that you can add to the list. Second: Prioritize and schedule wisely. Carefully identify your most important task for tomorrow and make sure you schedule enough time to complete it. For many, the period between lunch and 3 p.m. is a great window for uninterrupted work. Third: Write it down. Putting your plan on paper is about more than just remembering what to do. Writing activates a specific part of your brain called the reticular activating system (RAS). This area acts like a filter and puts important information, such as the things you write down, at the forefront of your mind. So with a prioritized, written plan of attack, you’ll be ready to conquer the day ahead!  Do you ever look at your to-do list and wish there were more than 24 hours in a day? Here are four tips on how you can make the most out of the time you have. Tip #1: Don’t waste time waiting around. You might not think the time between appointments is valuable, but these short periods can add up to significant hours. So instead of twiddling your thumbs or checking Facebook, spend your extra time productively. Chances are there’s an email you can reply to, or paperwork that needs to be done. Tip #2: Use the ask and chop technique to avoid procrastination. This is a helpful technique when you’re confronted with a task that feels too overwhelming to even start. First, ask yourself: What is the first step that needs to be taken? Then simply focus on chopping off that first step by completing it, then repeat the question. By chopping away the task in small steps, you’ll make progress without being intimidated by the scale of the larger project. Tip #3: Set your game clock. Create a challenge by giving yourself a short amount of time for a small task. When you meet your deadline, you’ll see how efficient you can be and learn that you really can do more with less time. And finally, tip #4: Pre-structure your meetings to meet solid goals. Unstructured, aimless meetings are a waste of time. People end up jumping from topic to topic or spending the meeting focusing on minor details. Make your meeting productive by giving it a focus. Open the meeting by articulating a clear goal that outlines what you want to accomplish. Everyone at the meeting will then be aware of the meeting’s focus, and you can spend the rest of the time productively in reaching that goal. Close the meeting by dedicating a short amount of time for questions or proposals. With these tips, you’ll be well on your way to creating more time in your working day by using each minute as efficiently as possible. Many people make New Year’s resolutions to kick a bad habit or to get into better shape. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon to revert to old habits or bad behavior after just a few weeks.  So how can you stick to a plan and develop new, better habits? Start by making a ritual of the positive habit you want to adopt. Making a ritual means doing something at the exact same time, each and every day. If you want to go to the gym more often, ritualize this new habit by setting a specific time to go, like 8:30 a.m. every day, and commit to it. By making your new goal a ritual, you’ll be less tempted to procrastinate or postpone. But if you start to doubt or feel like slacking off, remember that changing habits gets easier with time! As you start trying to change your habits, you can run into situations where old behaviors, like lying on the couch watching television, might feel like a better option. When this happens, resist the temptation by reminding yourself that this is a normal, temporary phase on the path to a great new lifestyle.  You might have to fight through these early stages – but it will get easier the longer you stick with it! To boost your fighting spirit, ask yourself two questions: How will I feel when I win this fight and stay committed to my new habit? How will I feel if I give up? These questions will help provoke feelings within you that can motivate you to stick with your goals. Finally, imagine how your new lifestyle will change things for you in the long run. It helps to do this through visualization: imagine your new self as a healthy, productive and confident person. This technique keeps your goal in mind and will motivate you to keep going for it! By applying these basic thinking techniques, anyone can stay committed to establishing new habits or making lifestyle changes – until the change finally becomes second nature.  Do you ever hesitate starting a task for fear that you may make a mistake or fall short of your own expectations? If so, you might be a perfectionist, and this can get in the way of evaluating yourself fairly.  When a perfectionist performs a self-evaluation, he is likely to focus more on shortcomings over whether something as a whole was done well. By basing a self-evaluation on the highest of standards, you are simply setting yourself up for disappointment. You can either fail to reach those standards and let yourself down, or you can meet expectations and see no reason to appreciate good work.  This can result in negative feedback, which in turn leads to stress and low self-confidence.  The better method is to appreciate when you do things well! Take the advice of legendary basketball coach John Wooden. He said that the most successful people always give themselves credit when it’s due. It’s also important to focus more on the process than on results.  By paying attention only to results, you won’t learn what needs to be done to get the results you want. When you focus on the process, you’ll learn what works best to reach your goals and what you might need to improve. Consider creating a success log, or a daily journal that will help you evaluate your process in a useful way. To start your journal, write down the realistic goals you hope to achieve each day, and take the time to evaluate your goals afterward. You should answer three questions: What did I do well today? What is one aspect I’d like to improve for tomorrow? Is there one thing I can do differently? When you answer these questions, you are focusing on setting goals around behavior and not on the external results. So be on the lookout for behaviors that contribute to success – they’ll point the way to continued progress! Have you ever talked yourself out of doing something? Maybe you were going to apply for a new job or ask for a promotion, but then you thought, “Why bother, it’s not going to happen, I’ll just end up getting my hopes crushed.” This is a bad habit that you can change. How you talk to yourself impacts your self-confidence. Over time we tend to believe whatever it is that we tell ourselves. You can either convince yourself that you’ll fail by thinking negatively, or you can boost your confidence and increase your chances of success by encouraging yourself. Even if you are doubtful in the face of a challenge, you’ll find that by continuing to feed yourself with positive thoughts, you’ll eventually feel the necessary confidence to get on with it. After all, you’ll never even approach a challenge if you don’t allow yourself the belief that you will succeed! Think of it like a coach: When a team is facing a tough match, it’s a coach’s job to rally the team with positive messages and keep them motivated. Without hope, no one would bother trying! Another important technique is to keep yourself from overthinking a problem. When you overthink, your mind turns the problem into an unsolvable obstacle, which can end up paralyzing you into inaction. Your brain releases stress hormones, leading to tension and the loss of any creative intelligence. This usually ends with the overthinker giving up to escape the stress. A much better way to achieve a goal is to relax and, instead of focusing on the problem, concentrate on a solution. Take stock of everything you have at your disposal, the tools that can help you solve your problem. Rather than becoming overwhelmed, take the task step by step, think positively and work out a gradual solution. Chances are you don’t enjoy making speeches in front of large groups of people. But every professional can learn how to give a decent speech; here are some keys to help you learn how. There are two important points to giving a good presentation: preparation and practice. When you prepare a speech, you want to make sure your audience understands your main ideas. In previous blinks, we learned that the mind can only handle a certain amount of information. Building on this, be aware that your audience, to stay engaged, requires a well-structured speech. You’ll also need to remove any elements in your speech that might distract a listener or obscure your message. To do this, write down your entire presentation and look at the first and last five minutes. Take out any details that seem superfluous. With your presentation lean and organized, you can then rehearse delivering it to an audience. If you’re overly nervous, you might appear awkward, fidgeting with clothes or hair. Before you take to the stage, reassure yourself that you’re well-prepared and boost your self-confidence by rehearsing the speech until you can recite it effortlessly. Take moments throughout the day, even during mealtimes, to mentally recite the details in your speech. Don’t forget to talk slowly, and pause after you make a point. People who speak at a calm, measured pace are often seen as more confident than people who speak quickly. And by allowing for pauses, you’ll give your audience time to better process the points you are trying to make. In contrast, if you’re preparing a one-on-one talk, there are two important things to keep in mind: First, keep the tone of your voice calm and friendly. This will allow the other person to be at ease, and what’s more, the person will also be more receptive to your message. Second, be sure to give the other person a chance to voice his thoughts, and listen carefully to what he has to say. If you speak slowly and pause frequently, this gives your partner the opportunity to respond. Why are people so hung up on being normal? Can you think of any great artist, writer or scientist who was considered normal? Normal people have traits, or “viruses,” that can keep them from achieving their goals. But abnormal people are immune to these viruses, and refuse to let them interfere with personal success. The main virus that plagues normal people is procrastination. The normal person is scared to pursue an ambitious goal, worried that failure awaits. And for that normal person, it is easy to find excuses not to start: laundry, a dirty kitchen, and so on.  But the abnormal person doesn’t look for excuses. Abnormal people look for ways around any obstacle. If the dog ate a notebook, the abnormal person will staple together some paper and make a new one. Abnormal people take control of their fate, convinced that they alone can achieve their goals. A secondary virus, related to procrastination, is focusing on things you can’t control. Normal people can blind themselves from the things they can control by obsessing over things they can’t. It’s too cold or rainy outside, the neighbor’s dog is barking, the coffee shop raised its prices, and so on. By focusing on such concerns, normal people distance themselves from the aspects of their life that they can actually improve. For abnormal people, such concerns are a waste of time and energy. Instead, they pay attention to what they can control and the parts of their lives they can improve. So do what abnormal people do: create a step-by-step plan of action on what you’d like to improve in your life and how to make it happen. You can even add a list of things that you can and can’t control, to make sure you don’t get distracted along the way. The key message in this book: If you want to be highly successful, you need to know how to control your mind and talk with yourself in a positive fashion. Always remember to focus on the solution rather than on the problem. And even when you’re at the top of your game, never forget the process that got you there.  Actionable advice: Build an evaluation ritual. Next time you have a bad day at the office and you feel that your self-esteem is flagging, don’t focus on what you did wrong. It’s much better to write down everything you did well. Such a positive evaluation will immediately increase your confidence, motivate you and improve your performance tomorrow.  Practice the Mental Workout to reduce anxiety about a task. First, relax your mind by controlling your breath. Inhale for five seconds, hold your breath for two seconds, and exhale for six seconds. Next recite a personal mantra, or a fixed set of encouraging statements. For example, “I’m strong, smart and confident and things will work out well.” Spend 60 seconds visualizing the situation you’re afraid of. Imagine what you’re going to see, how you’re going to feel, and what you’re going to say. Repeat your personal mantra and return to the breathing technique. Got feedback?

Wouldn’t it be great to simply snap your fingers and watch a cluttered room organize and clean itself? Unfortunately, the laws of physics prohibit such shortcuts, but there is another way to make tidying up simple – even fun. It’s called the organizing from the inside out method, and it works because it fits around your work schedule. These blinks teach you all about this method and how you can incorporate it into your life. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you should never get angry with a messy partner; how long it takes to clean a room on average; and why your messiness may have psychological causes. It’s happened to all of us: Desperate for a break from the chaos of our lives, we follow one of countless organizational tips and techniques touted as great solutions for eliminating disorder. For most of us, however, the effects are disappointing. Why? Many of these techniques are predicated on an outside in mentality. They are too general and we struggle to apply them to the real-world hassle of our lives. A better organizational solution is to work from the inside out – a strategy specific to you and your needs. But before you can re-organize your life from the inside out you’ll need to understand why it’s disorganized. You can’t fix something if you don’t know why it’s broken, and by focusing on these three common organizational problem areas you can find out where your system can be improved: First off, there are often simple, technical shortcomings that prevent your organizational system from reaching its full potential; think of missing labels or spaces that lack a clear purpose. Second, there are environmental problems – things beyond your control – that inhibit organization: Unrealistic expectations at work; big events, such as a new baby or a divorce; domestic problems, like an uncooperative partner; or simply not having enough space. The third area is psychological obstacles, things within yourself that propel you toward disorder – having unclear goals, for instance, or fears that prevent you from getting organized, or taking comfort in being surrounded by stuff. When working through these three areas keep in mind that several may be true for you in different ways. Don’t panic if you start to identify a lot of issues. Just stay honest with yourself and remember that all problems have a solution. The first step to beating disorganization is to identify what causes it. Only by honestly assessing your situation can you build a lasting solution. So start by knowing your obstacles. Imagine this: You spent hours cleaning up, attending to all the details, and the effort shows. Your home gleams! Then your partner gets home, throws his muddy shoes in the middle of the room, hangs his wet coat on the sofa and dumps the contents of his pockets on the table. In seconds, your hours of work are negated. At this point, you probably feel like strangling your partner. But restrain yourself – there’s help! Angrily insisting that your partner change his habits isn’t a great strategy. It requires a cleverer approach to actually tidy up someone’s habits, and here’s why: You can’t motivate someone with your own motivation. To get them moving, you need to help them tap into their own. One way to do this is by asking a question: What does your clutter cost you? Maybe your partner is always losing her keys and wastes hours searching for them. Or perhaps she almost broke her neck tripping over a pile of her stuff. Remind your partner of these things; it’ll be hard for her not to respond. Once your partner gets motivated, she’ll want to change her ways. Here’s one way to help: Of the many solutions to messiness, a great one for shared-living situations is to co-design rooms, giving each person their private space. This technique doesn’t only afford each partner their own little piece of home, it also helps them both learn about each other’s thinking and to see what’s important to the other one. In this way, you can see the logic behind your partner’s mess – maybe why that box of junk is so essential – and show them how you like to do things. Who knows: Maybe your good habits will even rub off on your partner. Now you know how to motivate a messy partner to clean up their act. The next step is to focus on your ability to organize from the inside out. When organizing your life it’s tempting to dive in and make huge changes right away. But jumping into your mess without evaluating it first can be disastrous. That’s because the key to organization is to start by analyzing the problem. Analyzing your situation helps you reach your goal by getting a clear idea of what it is. Use these five-needs assessment questions to evaluate your organizational challenge: First off, what works? It’s likely you’re not doing everything wrong. So take a minute to notice what runs smoothly. This will not only prevent you from eliminating good habits but also help you apply what’s working to what’s not. The next question is what doesn’t work? To figure out what’s wrong with your system, try keeping a list of the inefficiencies in your day-to-day life and how they slow you down. Hang the list in a prominent place to keep your areas of improvement in mind! Now that you’ve identified how you can improve, ask yourself which items are essential to you. This could be anything. Say music helps you relax at the end of a hard day. In that case, your CD collection would be a priority. After you decide on what you absolutely need to keep, try writing down why you want to get organized. Getting organized is difficult and knowing your motivation will help you stick with it. Finally, ask yourself what’s causing the problems you see. Is it a lack of will or skills? Maybe it’s your partner’s disorganization? This is key because you’ll only be able to solve your problems when you know what causes them. Analyzing the situation takes time and it’s tempting to skip it and dive right in, but investing time up-front will pay off tenfold down the line when you become truly organized. Just remember: Without an honest examination, true organization is impossible. So you’ve analyzed your organizational situation, and if you weren’t tempted to make changes before, you definitely are now. But first, it’s important to develop a few strategies. Organizational strategies will guide you, force you to pace your efforts and give direction to your work. Try out these two: The first strategy is called The Kindergarten Model of Organization and it works by dividing everything into different activity areas. It just takes three steps: First, define your activity zones. For instance, the place you work or where you watch TV. Then, draw a map of your space. Take into account your natural habits and preferences, considering the relationships between your activities. For example, if you like to watch TV with friends make sure your TV area has plenty of seating. Last, rearrange your furniture based on your map and watch as the changes you mapped out undo the chaos before your eyes! Take advantage of the diverse applications of this strategy by mapping anything, from your entire house to a single drawer. The second strategy is to honestly estimate the time necessary to get organized. This strategy is essential because most people are unrealistic about the time commitment required to organize their lives. Unrealistic expectations can derail your plans when your overestimation scares you out of starting or your underestimation causes you to lose motivation when you’re not magically successful. Avoid these fates by carefully planning how long each step will take. Remember, on average, organizing takes up to one and a half days per room. Say you estimate the time required and have second thoughts. Well, consider this: According to The Wall Street Journal, the average U.S. executive wastes six weeks every year searching for missing items in disorganized desks and files. That’s an hour per day! Now that you have the strategies to build a plan and estimate the time necessary to implement it, you’re ready to attack! So you’ve analyzed your situation and strategized a game plan. Now comes the exciting part: getting organized. Using the organizational acronym SPACE will get you started. “S” is for sort. Start by asking yourself questions like “Do I use this?” and “What category does this belong in?” Move through your mess methodically, identifying what’s important and grouping similar items. “P” stands for purge. It means decide what to get rid of and how. Remember, not every unessential item is trash; you can give some away, sell some or store them for another time. Make purging simple by setting up labeled boxes to easily put things in their place. Of course, getting rid of your stuff isn’t always easy. To motivate yourself imagine all the things you’ll get in return: space, time, money and satisfaction. For instance, imagine all the space you’ll have for new books if you toss the ones you’ve read! “A” stands for assign a home. Choose a place for your things by grouping similar items and considering what you use the most. Group your CDs with your stereo, for instance, and put the books you read in front of those you don’t. And store those least-used items, like the tent you drag out once a year, in the basement or attic. “C” is for containerize. Containers are key because they keep your sorted items grouped and separated. Have fun with this by color-coding or using themes, like keeping your kid’s pirate toys in a treasure chest. Last but not least, “E” stands for equalize. Once you get your organizational system in place, don’t pin it down. Monitor your set-up and make adjustments when necessary. Then keep organized by setting appointments to review the success of your system! After following through with SPACE you’ll be amazed at how your space transforms. Now that you’re equipped with the tools to organize, it’s time to take a look at examples of how to apply your knowledge. The beauty of organizing from the inside out is that it works in all scenarios. You can apply this system to anything, from huge jobs to small tasks, from situations of complete chaos to those that are only in slight disarray. By following the three-step process of analyzing, strategizing and then attacking, you can organize everything from your suitcase to your kitchen. But sometimes you’ll be faced with organizing someone else’s mess – most commonly that of your kid’s. When organizing your child’s space, don’t push them aside and do it all yourself. Instead, enlist their help and ask for their input. Why? Well, your kid won’t keep her room organized if it’s not done according to her needs. To ensure your child’s room gets clean and stays that way, make sure they play a role in every step of the process. But, of course, kids can be uncooperative and getting them to help out can be a pain. The best way to overcome this is by making organization fun. For instance, make tidying up dirty clothes a blast by installing a basketball hoop over the hamper. Getting your whole house – even your kid’s bedroom – in order will feel like a huge accomplishment, but don’t stop there. Organizing from the inside out can even be used to conquer time! Organizing your time is just like organizing your closet. You can use your new tools to turn your chaotic schedule into one that puts you in control. You just need to remember the three steps: Analyze to decide which activities are worthwhile and which ones you can do without. Strategize to decide what needs to be done and by when. And then attack by cutting out time-wasting activities and organizing your tasks into logical groups. For instance, paying all your bills at once. Now that you know the power of organizing from the inside out, it’s time to apply it to your life! The key message in this book: Even the most disorganized people can transform a life of chaos into one of order. But you’ll have trouble succeeding unless you personalize your strategy. You can whip your world into shape today according to your needs by analyzing, strategizing and then attacking your organizational problems.  Actionable advice: Start analyzing your organizational needs today. See where your organizational structure can improve by keeping a list of the things that slow you down each day. Pin the list on your fridge or on your front door to keep in mind how you can improve. Then use the suggestions to strategize and implement a plan for action!

Well, yes and no. Although attitudes toward gender, race and sexuality have evolved in recent years, there are still areas where people remain decidedly unenlightened. One such area concerns society’s approach to gender. Incredibly, most Western societies still adhere to the idea that a woman should raise children and look after the household while a man should concentrate his energies on his work. This outdated, backward point of view is making us all lead unfulfilled, overstressed lives. In these blinks, you’ll get a detailed look at how and why we are so stressed out and crucially, discover exactly what we can do to relieve daily pressures today and for the future. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why many CEOs think that a man who cares for his children is a poor employee; how being stressed out can make part of your brain shrink; and why African tribes have never had a problem finding adequate child care. We all know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed. Balancing your work and your private life is hard enough even when you have no dependents, but more so if you’re a parent with mouths to feed and diapers to change. There’s no question that parents today are stressed, having to juggle long working hours while raising a family. This balancing act places a great deal of pressure on an individual’s already limited time. In one 2008 study, the Families and Work Institute asked American workers about their daily lives and found that half of the respondents felt they had too many tasks for a typical workday. Some two-thirds felt they didn’t have enough time for themselves or their spouse; and three-quarters reported they didn’t have enough time for their children.   This sense of being overburdened is particularly prevalent among women. Since the 1970s, the percentage of employed women has risen dramatically, which has led to circumstances where, to carve out and maintain a job that generates enough income, many mothers need to work full time. Another study performed in 2004 asked mothers with children under six if they could say they often had any free time. None of the women in the study said they did! Yet a lack of free time isn’t just a problem for mothers; only 5 percent of fathers queried in the study said they had any free time. Unsurprisingly, a lack of free time has led to high rates of stress and anxiety in the United States. The American Psychological Association reported in 2011 that Americans as a whole are chronically overstressed. Earlier, a 2007 study by the World Health Organization found that Americans, while living in one of the world’s richest countries, are on average the world’s most anxious people. So life is stressful – but is stress that big of a deal? It is, and we’ll learn why in the next blink. Is stress always harmful? In short, no. Feeling stressed or anxious for short periods of time has actually benefitted humans throughout our evolution, sharpening our senses in times of threat. However, permanent stress caused by feeling overwhelmed on a daily basis is not beneficial. In fact, permanent stress actually damages our brains. Emily Ansell, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Yale Stress Center, discovered evidence of this effect as part of a groundbreaking study. She found that people who felt constantly overwhelmed had a prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain associated with sophisticated behaviors, such as planning, self-control and reasoning) that was actually smaller than of those who led less stressful lives. Moreover, the amygdala – the most ancient or “primitive” part of the brain associated with feeling fear, aggression and anxiety – correspondingly grows in size in people who are constantly stressed. Ansell predicts that such changes to the brain are likely to be associated with a diminished ability to control one’s emotions, and an increased risk of displaying addictive or self-destructive behaviors. Yet it’s not just the individual who suffers from being overwhelmed. High levels of stress experienced by so many people can have an aggregate effect on society. A stressed workforce, for example, is far less likely to be productive or conscientious. Bruce McEwen, the head of neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller University in New York, has found that overstressed medical students are less capable of making effective, complex decisions and are more likely to make careless mistakes.   Acclaimed psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi proposes that living with constant stress, which is connected to not being able to think clearly or orderly, makes it much more difficult  to reach a state of “flow thinking,” where one is able to focus deeply on a task and thus potentially find creative solutions to complex problems. We know that stress is bad and anxiety can hurt us both emotionally and physically. But how did we as a society get to this point of being so overwhelmed? The effects of the Industrial Revolution play a part in our transition to a more stressful world. With the advent of industrial production in the late 1700s and early 1800s, productivity, or getting the most work done in the shortest time, became a central goal. This meant that workers had to work harder for increasingly extended periods of time. Since then, such working habits have more or less stayed the norm, at least in the United States. In 2001, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found in its “Better Life Index” study that Americans work the longest hours in the industrialized world, with this lead increasing throughout the 1990s. In addition to long working hours, American workplaces are rather inflexible when compared to other OECD countries, which can cause tension between work responsibilities and home life. For example, American workers often can’t request flexible working hours or part-time work; what’s more, part-time workers lose out on benefits and insurance coverage, unlike in many European countries. The American workload has also increased since the beginning of the information age. In short, we haven’t evolved to cope with the constant influx of information that needs to be sifted through and understood each day. In fact, one study by researcher Jonathan Spira found that the average American worker can spend over half a working day merely processing emails! Figuring out what to focus on is, in and of itself, a major source of stress and unproductivity. Time management guru David Allen says that trying to decide what to pay attention to during a working day can lead to decision fatigue, which in turn creates a gnawing sense of anxiety. This constant stress breaks down an individual’s willpower, making it more difficult to curb interruptions. This in turn eats away at productivity, as it takes time to recover from each interruption. Although it may seem like we live in a more modern world, many of us are still, often subconsciously, influenced by the beliefs or stereotypes that influenced our grandparents’ generation. One such stereotype revolves around the ideal male worker, who focuses on his career from early adulthood until retirement, and the ideal mother, who alone cares for children and the home. While we may not openly admit it, people who deviate from these stereotypes are often perceived as somehow abnormal. For example, a 2012 survey by WFD Consulting queried more than 2,000 supervisors, managers and executives and revealed an entrenched caregiver bias. That is, more than half of those surveyed thought that men who were committed to their personal and family lives could not be equally committed to their jobs. The perpetuation of such roles places particular pressure on women, who find themselves torn between expectations at work and society’s view of their role at home, which in turn results in feelings of guilt and stress. In a 2008 study in the Journal of Applied Psychology, for example, working mothers were viewed as selfish and uncommitted mothers. The power of gender norms also encourages certain behaviors in men which cause stress, and often, men as well are penalized when they don’t adhere to societal expectations. Men too face a “flexibility stigma” when they seek out more flexible working hours, to care for children or family members for example. Sociologist Joan Williams found that co-workers and managers judge a man as uncommitted and lazy if he diverges from the stereotype of the “ideal worker.” Consequently, such men are often overlooked for promotions. So what can we do to crush such stereotypes? The next blinks will show you how. So how do we do away with inflexible, long working hours to something more humane and less stressful? Let’s look at some examples of companies that have found flexible, successful work strategies. Software design company Menlo Innovations was founded by Rich Sheridan, a man who spent years working unhappily in stressful, traditional workplaces. To create an environment more conducive to productivity and employee well-being, Sheridan focused on the idea of flexibility. To curb long hours working toward unreasonable goals, the company concentrated on setting realistic targets and, to make sure these goals were met, created a culture where the staff shared regular, constructive feedback – freeing employees to work when and how they saw fit. The result? Menlo employees express considerable satisfaction with their work-life balance and the company as a whole has been praised for its dynamism and creativity. What’s more, Menlo has been named by the American Psychological Association as one of the most “psychologically healthy workplaces” in the United States. Another interesting example is Clearspire, an online law firm. Clearspire harnesses the power of technology to allow employees to work from home. Evidence has shown that parents who are allowed to telecommute from an “online office” are more productive and far less overwhelmed. Working from home gives employees more autonomy over the organization of work and family time. Parents can then attend important family events and have more time for leisure activities, and importantly, are able to work when they’re most productive. The idea of judging productivity by the sheer number of hours worked is finally giving way to a more trusting work atmosphere, where employees such as those at Menlo are given clear, structured performance goals and the freedom to meet those goals however they see fit.   And importantly, Menlo as a company has achieved financial and reputational success in doing so! So you might think, if gender stereotypes still hold traction in society, perhaps they explain the way things actually are – shouldn’t we just accept them and move on? We shouldn’t. The truth is that gender stereotypes are socially constructed and not biologically determined. American anthropologist Sarah Hrdy’s research into child-rearing among the !Kung tribe of the Kalahari Desert in Africa, far from affirming the concept of a mother as the sole caregiver, showed that children are brought up collaboratively in the tribe, a practice called alloparenting. Likewise, the “grandmother” hypothesis, or that humans when compared to other primates live a considerably long time past child-bearing and child-rearing age, strongly argues against the ingrained stereotype of the nuclear family and the mother as a “natural” caregiver. Looking outside the United States, it is easy to see how negative gender stereotypes can be overcome. Denmark is a prime example, having spent the past 40 years, through active and interventionist state policy, attempting to address gender biases. Progressive state policies include one-year parental leave during a child’s first year of life for mothers and for fathers; setting maximum working hours; and guaranteed, high-quality child care. Consequently, such policies have inspired significant social change. For example, there is an almost total gender convergence with regard to time spent on housework, highly uncommon by world standards. Women in Denmark also enjoy the highest amount of leisure time in the world. Moreover, 60 percent of Danish men report being happiest in relationships where home and childcare responsibilities are evenly distributed, a significantly higher number when compared to the United States. Denmark is setting a solid example, as the country is consistently ranked (by the United Nations World Happiness Report, for example) as having the world’s happiest people; more competitive economy per hours worked than the United States; and 80 percent of Danish women in paid employment. So with good public policy and supportive workplaces, we can change stereotyped gender roles, which in turn reduces unnecessary stress for men and women. We now know what we need to do to overcome the societal stressors that make us overwhelmed. Now let’s focus on how to overcome our own problems, individually. We should first understand that as individuals, we can’t do everything. Instead, we should only do what is within our capabilities. Being swamped with an endless list of chores often leads to an acute sense of ambivalence as to what we should be doing right now, which causes stress and leads to unproductivity. To avoid this, we need to acknowledge that it’s impossible to do everything. Psychotherapists David Hartman and Diane Zimberoff recommend that people try to maintain realistic expectations of what they can achieve in any given day, and prioritize by concentrating on the most important tasks at work, as completing these tasks will make us feel satisfied and productive. Meditating and practicing mindfulness are other methods of overcoming stress and anxiety. Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has observed that the brain, when “left to itself...turns to bad thoughts, trivial plans, sad memories and worries about the future.” He stresses that “entropy, or disorder, confusion, decay, is the default position of the consciousness.” One way to tackle entropy is by engaging in mindfulness and meditation, which involves learning to experience the body and the mind in the present moment, and simply observe your thoughts. Even a few minutes a day of mindfulness can help you find a peaceful center free of unnecessary stress. In one study, neuroscientists at Harvard University found that after practising mindfulness and meditation for only eight weeks, the prefrontal cortex – that part of the brain responsible for planning and self-control – literally enlarges. And the fear center of the brain actually contracts! The key message in this book: We needn’t lead our working and private lives in accordance with outdated ideas and old-fashioned beliefs. Instead, we can change our personal lives, our workplaces and our society at large to create less stressful and generally happier lives. Actionable advice: Find a quiet place and meditate every day.  Combat feelings of being overwhelmed by practising mindfulness or meditation techniques regularly. They require just a few minutes of your day! Meditation is a proven method of finding a center and listening to your mind and body that can help you gain perspective and peace, regardless of your work or social situation.

That certainly applies to the world of work. From the perspective of our relentless 24/7 business culture today, the old days of nine-to-five shifts and three-martini lunches look about as mysterious and decadent as the lives of the late Roman emperors. Today, it’s hard enough switching off in your free time, never mind during office hours! That’s hardly surprising. After all, the mid-twentieth century and the present are, technologically speaking, light-years apart. Innovations like the internet, email and smartphones have made it harder than ever before to get away from work. If you have an iPhone, your boss is always right there in your pocket waiting for you to open that email she sent at 10:00 p.m. And that’s starting to take its toll. Professionals have never been so stressed and sleep-deprived. They’re unhappier, less productive and staring down the barrel of burnout. So it’s high time to make some changes! These blinks walk you through a series of simple, stress-busting strategies and explains the science behind them. Start integrating them into your professional life today, and you’ll be amazed at how much better you’ll soon feel. In these blinks, you’ll learn why office stress triggers your fight-or-flight reflex; what a little meditation can do for your mental and physical well-being; and why keeping up with old friends can help you beat work-related stress. There’s no sugarcoating it – life has become more stressful. Getting up at six, grinding out a grueling shift at the metaphorical coalface and collapsing into bed at eleven in the evening is the new normal. But it wasn’t always like this. In fact, things have gotten a whole lot crazier over the last decade. So, what’s behind our increasingly hectic work lives? Well, let’s rewind to 2008. The economy was in freefall, and companies were scrambling to adjust to the harsh new realities. Lots of companies only managed to survive by downsizing their staff and restructuring workloads. The result was fewer people shouldering a whole lot more than their fair share of responsibilities. Then there’s the smartphone. Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007. Soon enough, it had taken over the world. According to a 2012 study in the MIT Technology Review, the iPhone conquered 40 percent of the American mobile phone market within just a couple of years. That’s pretty astonishing when you consider the fact that it took computers fourteen years to achieve anything close to that level of market penetration. The problem, however, is that smartphones don’t just make life more convenient and fun. Sure, you can check Instagram and send tweets, but this also means you’re always on standby mode. Your work is never more than a click away. A 2013 study carried out by the Center for Creative Leadership highlighted this trend. The surveyed executives and managers with smartphones spent an astonishing 72 hours every week engaged in work-related activities! That’s not sustainable. When work gets too hectic, our stress levels shoot through the roof. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, 33 percent of all Americans suffered acute work-related stress in 2013, while 48 percent claimed that their stress levels had increased over the previous five years. A full 83 percent of interviewees in the study believed that stress was negatively affecting their health. They’re not wrong! When the Benson-Henry Institute in Massachusetts looked into the matter, they found that between 60 and 90 percent of all trips to the doctor were stress-related. So what can you do to beat stress? Stay tuned to find out! Have you ever had the urge to jump out of your office chair, run right out the door and never come back? That’s a pretty good sign you might be suffering from work-related stress. The desire to flee is one of the body’s natural responses to stress. That’s part of the “fight-or-flight” response, a cerebral and hormonal reaction to life-endangering events. Here’s how it works. Imagine someone jumps out from behind a corner with a weapon. Your brain – or, more precisely, the command center of your brain known as the thalamus – is the first to react. This, in turn, triggers the amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for processing emotions. This then activates the hypothalamus, the area in charge of regulating the autonomic nervous system, which transmits a message to your adrenal glands. These start pumping out adrenaline – a hormone that prepares your body to react quickly and, if need be, violently. Once it runs out of adrenaline, your body switches to cortisol, another hormone with a similar effect. This reaction makes you more alert and prepares you to fight or flee. Strange as it may sound, a difficult boss or impossible deadlines are just as likely to trigger this response as a knife-wielding maniac. That’s a problem. If you’re sitting in your office producing adrenaline and cortisol for hours on end, this creates a hormonal imbalance that can be damaging to your health. So here’s a great tip: learn to beat the fight-or-flight reaction by practicing mindfulness. A quick and dirty mindfulness routine involves nothing more than focusing on your breathing. Take ten deep breaths followed by a pause, and you’ll already feel a lot better. The second option requires a bit more practice, but it’s an invaluable anti-stress tool: meditation. That’s not just good for your mental well-being – it’s also good for your physical health. That’s the conclusion of a 2000 study by Herbert Benson, a professor at Harvard Medical School. It showed that regular meditation could actually shrink the size of the amygdala and thus counteract that unwanted stress response! But that’s not all you can do to reduce your stress levels. In the next blink, we’ll take a look at how to plan your day to minimize stressful experiences. You’ve probably heard the old Chinese proverb that says giving a man a fish feeds him for a day, but teaching him to fish feeds him for a lifetime. That’s also a good motto when it comes to stress reduction. Quick fixes like nipping out for a coffee have their uses, especially when you’re in a pinch, but the best way to minimize stress is to develop a long-term anti-stress plan. Here’s an idea: start by trying to work out a supportive daily work rhythm. That’s precisely what Hilton Hotels CEO Chris Nassetta did. In his case, that involved getting up earlier to free up time to mull over his day’s responsibilities. Nassetta gets up at five every morning and aims to be in the office by six at the latest. Since his work officially only starts somewhere between eight and nine, that gives him at least two hours to prepare for the day ahead. The upshot? He can think through his tasks without losing focus or worrying about what’s coming up later. Rather than drifting off in the middle of a conversation because he’s worried about what he’ll say in an upcoming meeting, he can be fully present and engage with the people he’s talking to. It’s worth noting at the outset that you won’t always pull off your ideal work rhythm. In practice, you’ll have to be flexible and roll with the punches. Take it from Crystal Cooper, the vice president for public representation at global IT company Unisys. She initially resented the demands her work placed on her schedule. No wonder – being on call 24/7 is pretty intense! But after a while, she decided to go with the flow and adapt her expectations. Rather than planning to spend two hours of quality time with her family between seven and nine in the evening, she made sure she fit those hours in whenever the chance presented itself throughout the day. Imagine you had to summon all your willpower to do even the most mundane tasks, like brushing your teeth or tying your shoelaces. Life would be unbearably exhausting, right? Luckily the human mind has an autopilot function that helps you do these things without wasting too much brainpower. And here’s the thing – you can get the most out of that nifty cerebral technology by cultivating routines. That’s good news for your personal life. So, how can you start putting that into practice? Well, there are three words you need to remember: cue, routine and reward. Let’s take Patricia as an example to see how it works. The author met Patricia at a workshop, where she told him about a routine she’d developed. When she got home from work, she entered her house through a side door that leads to a small washroom. That was her cue to take out her phone and plug it into the charger attached to a socket above the washing machine – that’s the routine part. Once she’d done that, she could spend the evening with her family, free from all distractions – that’s the reward. Because the reward was something she genuinely enjoyed, the routine was quickly established. What about work, though? Well, if you want to improve your professional life, you might want to think about establishing feedback systems. Take Doug, a man struggling with his role as a project leader. The issue was simple: Doug’s colleagues weren’t happy with the way he always focused on the negatives. Rather than ignoring the problem, Doug took this feedback to heart and resolved to change his ways. With the author’s help, he developed a feedback mechanism. Every time he started getting too negative, his colleagues gave him a signal by raising three fingers. It was an informal and friendly gesture that allowed him to directly and effectively address an uncomfortable issue. The result? A happier, more efficient and satisfied team! Lots of people accept stress as a fact of life and try to put a brave face on it. It’s only when they finally burn out or get seriously ill that they start considering changes. But that’s not the right approach. In fact, you can spare yourself no end of suffering by taking action today. And here’s the good news: you don’t even need to make particularly radical changes to boost your well-being. Sometimes all it takes to beat work-related stress is exercise. That doesn’t necessarily mean taking out a gym membership, though. Simple rhythmic and repetitive movements like walking, jogging, cycling, dancing or even going through some yoga poses can significantly reduce stress. Why? Well, there are a couple of reasons. First off, movement helps your body eliminate those stress hormones that were mentioned earlier. Nothing purges them from your system like a spot of exercise. Then there are the psychological effects of movement. Focusing on your body for a few minutes is an excellent way of getting out of your head and interrupting those obsessive thoughts that go hand-in-hand with stress. That’s not just a theory, either. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal reporting on the results of a one-year study of professionals, workers who regularly used a treadmill experienced less stress, interacted more with their colleagues and were more productive than their peers who didn’t exercise. That said, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Your best bet is to try out different types of exercise and see what works for you. The most important point to remember is that if you choose something you enjoy, you’re much more likely to stick with it. If you like taking walks around the park, do that. If you prefer jogging with a friend, well, do that. What you opt for will also depend on your commitments. If you need to be super-flexible, developing an exercise routine you can do in your office might be a good idea. If you’re the organized type, weekly swimming lessons might be the way to go. As we’ve seen, physical movement is an excellent way of relieving stress. Unfortunately, that’s not something we can do whenever we need a bit of relief. After all, you can’t just leave your office to go for a jog whenever you feel like it! That means it’s also a good idea to develop some cognitive strategies to quiet your mind. In this blink, we’ll look at two top techniques that’ll help you do just that. Let’s start with being in the moment. Stress is all about worrying about the past or the future. Learning to appreciate the present pushes those anxiety-inducing thoughts to the back of your mind. Best of all? You can start practicing this kind of mindfulness without making any changes to your routine. The reason for that is simple. Remember those autopilot activities like brushing your teeth we talked about earlier? Well, those are the kinds of things you can focus on to become more present! All you have to do is make a conscious effort not to zone out and instead direct your attention to what you’re doing. That’s about learning how to appreciate, say, the way the water is running down your body or feels on your skin when you take a shower. Whenever you find your mind wandering, make an effort to refocus it on those sensations. The second technique involves visualizing stress-free success. Start by asking yourself what you want to achieve and then concentrate on what it is you’d need to do to pull that off. If you’ve got an important presentation coming up, for example, and you really want to impress the audience, what would that take? Well, you’d need to be well-rested, prepared and punctual. Visualize those steps and work backward from there. What do you need to do to make sure you’re well-rested, for example? This is a great way of pushing vague anxieties out of your mind and really honing in on the things that are in your control – a guaranteed stress-reliever. What’s worse than those endless shifts that bite into your evening? Getting off work and not having anything to do or anyone to do it with. The simple truth is that isolation just isn’t good for your mental health. Friends matter – a lot! That means it’s in your best interest to make an effort to stay in touch with old friends. How you do that depends on your personality type. As Susan Cain points out in her book Quiet, introverts will generally prefer seeing more of fewer people. Cain, a self-professed introvert, says she spends 80 percent of her free time with just 10 percent of the people she knows. That means it’s important for her to regularly reach out and give a select number of old friends a call or invite them out for a drink.   Extroverts are the opposite. They generally prefer seeing more people less often. Take psychologist and author Adam Grant. He goes out of his way to reconnect with someone he hasn’t seen in a while once a month. That’s a great way of reactivating old contacts and keeping the connection alive. Then there are new friendships. Few things can help you beat stress more effectively than cultivating new friends in your workplace. Why? Well, as a 2006 Gallup study showed, having just one good friend at work increases your morale and engagement levels up to seven times more than the normal amount. That’s easier said than done, of course, so let’s take a look at a couple of tips you can use to help you get to know your colleagues. The simplest option is to respond enthusiastically when colleagues reach out to ask for help or invite you to take part in some after-work activity. If you’re pressed for time, you can be more strategic. Position yourself outside the main exit at lunchtime and pretend you’re waiting for someone and you’ll have a great opportunity to exchange a couple of words with your colleagues. In the previous blinks, we’ve talked a lot about stress and how to overcome it. As we’ve seen, stress is inherently harmful. That’s why one of the simplest and most effective ways of getting it out of your system is to stay positive. That means learning to be genuinely grateful for the things that are going well. Take Kaye Foster-Cheek, a senior executive at the Boston Consulting Group. She’s found that making time to experience gratitude has boosted her well-being significantly. So it’s the first thing she does when she wakes up. Rather than jumping out of bed, she takes a moment to reflect on how grateful she feels to simply be lying there with a new day ahead of her. Alanson Van Fleet, an executive in the financial sector whom the author coached, takes a similar approach. His moment of gratitude comes when he walks through his office door and sees the small statue of the Buddha he keeps next to his computer, which reminds him how grateful he is that his company pays for his personal office space. Those are great examples of how paying attention to those little details we all too often take for granted can help you beat stress. Here’s another tip: use visual cues in your workplace to reconnect with your core values. When you’re under intense pressure and feeling adrift, catching sight of something familiar and loved can be a real lifesaver. Personal manager Tracy Columbus, for example, keeps Native American art in her office. Whenever she’s feeling blue, she turns to the images and their joyful colors. Peter Block, another of the author’s clients, does something similar. When he looks at the artwork in his office, he thinks of the time, patience and dedication the artists put into their creations – a reminder that that’s also something he seeks to do. That goes to show that stress isn’t inevitable or inescapable. So, if you’re feeling under pressure, try out some of these stress-relieving strategies. You’ll be amazed at what a difference a couple of minutes of mindfulness or a quick walk around the park can make to your personal and professional life! The key message in these blinks: Increased workloads, demanding bosses, increasingly intrusive tech and a 24/7 business culture – no wonder today’s workforce is more stressed than ever. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Follow the simple stress-busting strategies in these blinks and you’ll be well on your way to beating burnout!  Actionable advice: Get a coaching partner.  Building a new routine is hard work, especially in the early stages. That’s why it’s a good idea to find a coaching partner who’s embarked on the same path as you. Together, you can support each other on your journey. Whether that’s just a phone call to check in now and again or a gym buddy, having a partner who’s got your back is the best way to make sure you follow through on your resolutions. Got feedback?

Bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and ready to take on the world? Or more like poor old Sisyphus, the king from Greek mythology who was condemned to push a boulder up a hill – and have it roll back down every time he was about to reach the summit? If it’s the eternally-struggling king you identify with, then it might be time to do what he couldn’t do – take a break and reassess your priorities. After all, your work doesn’t have to be Sisyphean. There are other hills out there. Find the one that’s right for you, and you may even enjoy the climb to the top. The question is how to make your choice. That’s where these blinks come in. Taking time out is a serious business. Plan your pause properly, and you’ll emerge on the other side feeling reinvigorated and much clearer about your true life goals. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how to identify the five telltale signs that you need a break; why understanding your yearnings is crucial; and how to design a break that makes the most of your resources. Have you ever had a job you absolutely loved – until, suddenly, you didn’t anymore? Sometimes the fun’s simply gone and the thought of another day at the office fills you with nothing but dread. That’s a sign you might need a break. Call it a pause. A pause is a moment of reflection during which you give yourself the time and space to get back in tune with your intuition. Once you do that, you can start planning changes that’ll put you on the road to a better, more authentic life. But that comes later. First, you need to recognize that you need a time-out. The two most common signs are hating your job and poor performance. The author noticed these herself during her time as a support manager at Google. At first, she found her work fulfilling, but, over time, she realized that she was feeling stuck. She struggled to get things done as quickly as she was expected to and checked out mentally during meetings. Overwhelmed and burned out, she lost all her enthusiasm. Unsurprisingly, her performance suffered. Her boss tried to help her by offering constructive feedback, but she just couldn’t get back into the groove of things. Eventually, she was told that she wasn’t a good fit for her job. It was clear that she needed a pause – badly! Poor performance and discontent are pretty definite indicators that taking a break might be a good idea. But they aren’t the only ones. You should also pay attention to how you use technology. Sure, the latest gadgets and gizmos are great, but overusing them is often a symptom of an underlying problem. If you notice that you’re glued to your devices and letting them get in the way of simple pleasures like a walk in the park or spending an evening with friends, you’re probably ready for a break. Then there are big life changes that demand time and attention. If someone you love asks you for help during a tough period in her life, it’s not a bad idea to hit the pause button. Finally, there are positive reasons for taking a pause. New opportunities that you’re interested in exploring – a job opening, for instance – fall under this category. Look out for these signs and ask yourself whether a pause might be right for you. If it is, now’s the time to start planning it. In the next blink, you’ll learn why understanding your yearnings is central to that process. A pause can be relaxing and fun, but that’s not its true purpose. Taking a time-out is all about accomplishing something you find meaningful. And to do that, you have to understand your yearnings. Let’s jump in with a definition. Yearnings are your deepest desires. Some, like the need to feel alive and loved, are universal; others are much more personal. But there’s a catch. It’s all too easy to let yourself be distracted and avoid addressing your yearnings. Take it from the author. She spent more and more of her time online, even when she was in the company of friends. Her obsessive email-checking and social-media use ended up getting in the way of her real life. That left her dissatisfied. And no wonder – she was ignoring her yearning for real, face-to-face human connection. So how can you find out what matters most to you? Well, there’s a nifty trick to help you figure that out. It’s called the “so that” test. Here’s how it works. Start by thinking of something you want. Now ask yourself why you want it by adding “so that” to your answer. Say Bob wants money. “Why?” he asks himself. “So that I can go on vacation.” But he doesn’t stop there. He keeps asking the same question. He wants a holiday so that he can go bungee jumping. Why? Well, doing that would make him feel more alive. That’s the end of the chain. Bob’s real yearning is to feel more alive. This is the first step. Once you know what your yearnings are, you can design your pause to fulfill them. Start with a brainstorming session. Draft a rough sketch of what your break might look like. Note down key words and ideas. These could be places or activities like “beach” or “biking.” Write them out on sticky notes or in a journal to remind yourself of them. Next come intentions. Think back to your yearnings and ask yourself what you want to achieve during your pause. You can keep it vague at this stage and go with something like “learn to be more present in the moment and a better listener.” Finally, use your notes to formulate a plan. But don’t make it too specific – after all, you’re not creating a list of chores! Knowing what you want to achieve during your pause is essential, but there’s something else you’ll have to consider before you dive in – the resources at your disposal. That’s where the three pause dials come in. Think of a car’s dashboard, with its display telling you how much fuel and oil you have. You’d check them before hitting the open road, right? Well, it’s just as vital to cast an eye over your pause dials before setting off. That way, you’ll know that you’ve got enough gas in the tank to reach your destination. Let’s start with the first two dials. These measure your material assets – money and time. The money dial is the first thing you’ll want to look at. Say you’re taking a break from work. Will you be taking paid or unpaid leave? If money is an issue, ask yourself if there’s a “side hustle” – a bit of extra work in a different field – that could help you generate some cash. This could be anything from making craft jewelry to freelance writing. Next, there’s the time dial. This will tell you how long you can pause for. It’s vital that you have enough time; if you don’t, you may not be able to achieve the goals you’re setting out to accomplish during your pause. Is your employer likely to be flexible about time? Now that you’re up to speed on money and time, you can take a look at your activity dial. This is basically a tool to help you assess which activities you can plan for given your available resources. Maybe you’ll have a lot of time but not much money. In that case, perhaps a free online course is a good idea. If you have both time and money, you could consider travel. Low on cash and short on time? Try a walk in the park or a picnic with your friends. As you can see, the three dials are interrelated. That means it’s important to keep checking them as you plan your pause. Keeping them in balance will enable you to arrange a more coherent and enriching break. Formative experiences can end up holding you back later on in life. A teacher telling you that you’re not good at painting, for example, might leave you doubting your artistic abilities for the rest of your life. That’s an example of a limiting belief. Such beliefs are often deeply ingrained, and when the going gets tough, you’ll tend to fall back on them. Ultimately, they can prevent you from doing the things you truly care about. But here’s the good news. Once you start noticing and understanding your limiting beliefs, you can also start changing them. These old thought patterns are what the author calls fear tapes – loops of negativity stored in your mental library. They come in all shapes and sizes. Loss-of-control tapes involve a fear of losing control and not knowing what’s going to happen next. They make you ask yourself, “What will happen next?”, ”What if I don’t like this Pause?” Lack-of-approval tapes fill your head with questions like, “What will my friends think?” Self-sabotage tapes tell you that you don’t deserve any better and shouldn’t even try to improve your situation. You’ve probably heard them all a thousand times. But that doesn’t mean you have to keep on playing them. In fact, you can simply eject them and put something else on! Thanks to what scientists call neuroplasticity – your brain’s ability to create new neural pathways – you can exchange those negative tapes for a more positive mental playlist, and thus change the very structure of your thoughts and attitudes. A great way to do this is to take up the habit of mental flossing. This basically means becoming aware of your own fear tapes. A key part of mental flossing is learning how to TASER. That’s an acronym for tune in, acknowledge, shift, express and repeat. Here’s how it works. Start by tuning in. Imagine your inner critic repeating your limiting belief aloud. Once you can hear the words, acknowledge that you have this belief and the way it’s conditioned you over the years. Now it’s time to shift. That means imagining the opposite of what you’ve just heard. Take a negative thought like “I’m not good enough” and stand it on its head by affirming that you are good enough. Next, express this new, positive thought. Repeat it aloud until you really start to feel it. Finally, repeat the whole process! Remember, limiting beliefs are deep-seated. It takes time and effort to change them. But keep at it long enough, and your new beliefs will eventually stick. You can start doing this already while planning your pause. It’ll help you avoid limiting your options. You’re now well on your way to planning a great pause. In this blink, you’ll learn some techniques that’ll make it even more meaningful. Let’s start with guidelines and habits. A pause shouldn’t be an endless to-do list. Free time is valuable. But it’s important not to slip into old habits and waste time on endless internet sessions or sleeping till noon. Writing down between three and five clear rules for yourself will help you avoid that. These rules could be anything from limiting your smartphone use to 30 minutes per day to making your bed as soon as you get up. But don’t just make an effort to ditch bad habits; try to adopt healthy ones instead! Practicing self-care, for example, is great for your health. Try taking a daily walk in the park or booking a massage every now and then. You’ll feel nourished and motivated. Even something as small as a hot bath or wrapping yourself in a comfortable blanket can work wonders. It’s also useful to put your pause into a long-term perspective. What changes do you want to make to your life after your pause? Reflecting on your habits is a good place to start. Compare your old and your new desired habits after your pause, and make a list of the ones you want to keep in your life and the ones you’re ready to ditch. The author noted down the habits she found nourishing and wanted to keep up. They included taking a daily tea break in the afternoon, inviting friends to dinner once a month, blogging and keeping a journal. The list of habits she was eager to jettison included biting her nails, watching too much TV, drinking too much alcohol and spending more than an hour a day on social media. She also made use of Tom Rath’s Strengths Finder 2.0, a best-selling book that shows readers how to unlock their hidden talents. Identifying her skills and strengths helped her think more productively about the kinds of jobs she wanted to apply for. At this stage, you’re pretty much set for a great pause. That leaves just one more question: What will your post-pause life look like? Okay, so you’ve had a great pause, and it’s time to get back to your life. What’s next? Well, start by reflecting on what you’ve learned. Do that, and your new and nourishing habits are much more likely to stick. To facilitate reflection, ask yourself a few revealing questions. What did you learn from this pause? Did you learn more about your yearnings? Do you still want to continue on the path you’re on? What will and what won’t you now tolerate? Answering these questions can really put things in perspective. You can even follow the author’s example and use a special formula to make your insights actionable. How will what you’ve learned by doing X – planning activities, say – assist you in doing Y – spending more time with your family? Creating an inventory of your strengths is another useful way to guide your future plans. When the author took stock of her real strengths, it became apparent that she’s an achiever, that she loves learning and that she’s very competitive. She’s also positive and encouraging. Knowing this helped her understand how she might apply them in her next role. By now you’ll have a good overview of the ways you’ve grown as a person. Next, you’ll need to decide whether you want to return to your pre-pause life or look for new adventures. Growth is the result of learning something new. Say you’ve spent your pause playing the guitar. That’s a new skill. But chances are it’s not just your finger-pickin’ chops that have improved; you’re probably also much more aware of your strengths, limits and overall situation. Acquiring this new skill has, in short, taught you something about yourself, your interests and what kind of side gig you might like to pursue after the pause. In other words, you’re much more self-aware. And that means you’re ideally placed to look at your professional life with fresh eyes. Do you need to switch your job to be happy? Maybe being a banker doesn’t fulfill your yearnings, but making art would. Or perhaps your current job just isn’t where you’re meant to be. Making time for a pause is well worth it. It’s both nourishing and replenishing. At the end of your break, you’ll have a much deeper understanding of your true needs and wants. And that’ll set you up for your next adventure! The key message in these blinks: If you find yourself waking up dreading another day in the office, you might just need a pause. Taking a break isn’t just about relaxing, though – it’s an opportunity to reevaluate your path in life and understand your true needs and desires. Plan your pause carefully and you’ll not only feel reinvigorated; you’ll be ready to live a more authentic life.  Actionable advice: Start small and plan a mini-pause today.  Quitting your job or taking extended leave and trying to figure out what you really want to do can be a daunting prospect. So why not start small and take a mini-break today? It can be as simple as finding a moment of true mindfulness. Grab a drink and take a seat. Switch off your phone. Clear your mind of all distractions and focus on your beverage. Now take a sip. Savor the moment and the taste – imagine it’s the last drink on earth. Sometimes a few minutes of being purely in the moment is all it takes to set your mind at rest and restore your energy.

Pawliw-Fry","summary":"Are you one of those people who leaves things to the last minute? Are you convinced that deadline pressure actually makes you work better? You just might be mistaken. Scientific evidence shows that while pressure may keep us from procrastinating, it nearly always impedes our creativity and makes us reach for the most conventional solutions. Pressure can even distort our thinking or make us freeze up altogether. It turns out that the most successful people are those who have learned to perform well despite the world breathing down their necks. But how can you master the techniques needed to do the same? These blinks will help you to overcome pressure and make yourself a productive powerhouse. In these blinks, you’ll discover what your ability to deal with pressure tells you about your love life; why saying “I need a car” can make you unhealthy; and how a “COTE” of armor can help you to deal with pressure.  Think about taking an important exam. Are you afraid, eager? Do your palms sweat, or nerves twitch? The sensations you felt in that moment are typical of high-pressure situations. Unfortunately, pressure and stress can hamper your performance when it’s most essential that you succeed. Pressure moments can affect performance in everything, from your day job to your relationships. Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile’s research into creativity in the workplace discovered that pressure negatively affects both creativity and productivity. Although some workers felt more creative when under pressure, the fact of the matter is that while they were certainly completing tasks, their performance was actually on a much lower creative level. Pressure affects more than work. The secret to a successful relationship isn’t chemistry between partners but a pair’s ability to interact in pressure moments. For example, couples who criticize each other, saying things like “You’re too selfish,” put a tremendous amount of pressure on a relationship. As a result, the partnership suffers as each individual inevitably feels dissatisfied with the other. Stress, on the other hand, occurs in different scenarios. While it’s common to experience pressure in situations where success is crucial, like during a college entrance exam, we tend to experience stress in situations with too many demands and too few resources, such as a work day with lots of back-to-back meetings. But what’s the connection between pressure and stress? Stress affects us just like pressure by decreasing our creativity. But stress is a different phenomenon and therefore begs a different solution than does pressure. The trick to dealing with stressful situations is reduction. For instance, focusing on only what you’re doing right now will help you manage stress. But in a pressure situation, you should focus on the final result, whether it means safely landing a helicopter or winning a basketball game. In short, this means in pressure moments you should focus on success and adapt your behavior to constantly advance. Have you ever started a presentation with the idea that every word you said would be perfect? Of course – we all put pressure on ourselves to do so. But it’s essentially counterproductive. Why? Because doing so leads to a specific type of failure caused by pressure, called choking. Here’s how it works. Pressure tends to mess with your performance system, things such as physical arousal, thoughts and behavior. Disturbing any one of these can undermine your whole system. For instance, say you’re giving a speech and can feel the pressure building up: your heart races, your mind goes blank and you can barely read the words in front of you. You’re choking! Pressure can also affect your memory. For example, in pressure moments you tend to actively monitor your own performance, thereby consuming your brain’s resources. What happens when you do this? Your procedural memory, a crucial function that helps you perform complex tasks without thinking, is blocked. Imagine that a friend has been rehearsing for a piano recital for weeks. But when she gets on stage, she starts paying close attention to her every move and all of a sudden, can’t recall a single note. In other words, she chokes. But how does this happen at all? A simple thing, such as your perspective on a situation could trigger pressure – and even lead to depression. Here’s how this works. Your cognitive appraisals, which determine how you see the world, are affected by pressure leading to a phenomenon known as cognitive distortions, an effect so strong that it can produce anxiety and depression. For instance, thinking that you “need” something, like a new car, puts pressure on yourself and risks making you ill. To control a distorted reality, it’s essential to take control of your words. Therefore, instead of thinking “I need a car,” think “I want a car.” The pressure of the sentence, and of the situation overall, will be immediately reduced. So we know that pressure is bad, but how can you deal with it? There are simple ways to minimize pressure and reduce your worries. For instance, an easy strategy to adopt is to not take things too seriously. This works by reducing pressure and therefore your fear of failure. Imagine you’re heading to an important interview and really feeling the pressure. Your friend asks you, “What’s the worst that could happen?” and tells you to relax. While you probably have the urge to snap at her, she might have a point. Because being able to see your situation as normal reduces the pressure you’ve built and leaves you free to do your best. After all, worrying too much about failure can be a distraction from what you have to do. So make it your goal to keep your head clear and focused. But how do you do this? Instead of worrying about what the interviewer might ask you, focus on what you need to do to shine. Do plenty of research and rehearse what you’re going to say. Another trick to dealing with pressure works by helping you remember your values amid high-stakes scenarios. Here’s how it works. In pressure moments, you can be so eager to do what’s expected of you that you forget your personal values. To ensure this doesn’t happen, you should prepare for such moments by listing your values in order of relative importance. For example, success might be very important to you, but fairness more so. Say your boss expects you to strike a deal with a new company, but over the course of negotiations you discover that the agreement would require you to underpay your employees to meet the company’s rock-bottom price expectations. Since you know that fairness is more important to you than success, it will be that much easier to avoid that pressure to accept the company’s unfair conditions. To do your best when it counts, it’s essential to develop attributes that help you thrive in pressure moments. Consider these qualities your “COTE” of armor: Confidence, Optimism, Tenacity and Enthusiasm. Confidence is key to keep you pressing ahead when the going gets tough. As your self-confidence increases, your anxiety reduces and it becomes easier to perform well under pressure. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that people with higher confidence perform better, work harder, persist longer and even consider themselves smarter and more attractive than their peers. It’s easy to increase your own confidence simply by striking a high-power pose. Begin by physically opening your body, lifting your arms up, standing straight and pulling your shoulders back. Stand like this for a couple of minutes. This confidence-building posture is enough to lower your stress hormones and boost your testosterone, giving you more courage! Like confidence, optimism will help you move forward despite pressure. If you look at things positively and have good expectations for the future, you’ll be more likely to do things that are uncomfortable now, like taking risks or working hard. Debra is a young woman who, after a terrible car accident, suffered from multiple fractures and months and months of a difficult, painful recovery. Yet Debra was still grateful to be alive each and every day. Her positive attitude was so powerful it gave her the strength to keep working and got her back on her feet. How can you develop an optimistic attitude? Try starting your days by appreciating every little thing around you. Things like a cozy bed, fresh air and your loving family. By cherishing the small things, you’ll learn to see the positive side in every situation. Now that you know about confidence and optimism, it’s time to complete your “COTE” of armor with tenacity and enthusiasm. Confidence and optimism are great for getting you moving when things get tough, but to keep moving forward despite constant pressure, you’ll also need tenacity. Tenacity comes into play when there is a goal for which you want to strive. Because when you’re working to achieve something you want, you’ll put up with challenges and frustrations you’d never otherwise tolerate. For example, say you’re scared of speaking in public, but want to inspire your classmates to care about animal rights. You’d likely be willing to stomach the fear of delivering a speech that would make them all give up their ham sandwiches! Tenacity can get you to do things you wouldn’t otherwise think yourself capable, but enthusiasm will help you stay passionate and creative in spite of pressure. Enthusiasm gives you energy to keep working and doing your best. It can be like a virus in that it is quickly catching, positively affecting those around you. Even in situations where pressure has almost killed your creativity, enthusiasm can kick it back into gear! For instance, when under pressure to produce results, it’s common to narrow your scope and work toward any solution. But if you’re passionate about what you’re doing, you’re likely to broaden your mind in search of something truly original. So the next time you face a high-pressure moment, such as giving a speech before the board of directors, be sure to act enthusiastically so you will feel enthusiastic. If you need an enthusiasm boost try laughing, recall a positive memory or listen to upbeat music.  The key message in this book: Pressure affects the human brain, changing the way you think and behave often in the worst moments. To improve your performance under pressure, it’s necessary to learn the right strategies to become more confident, optimistic, tenacious and enthusiastic – and thus successful! Actionable advice: Focus on an object to keep your thoughts in the present. Focusing on the present moment is a great way to conquer high-pressure situations. You can increase your general presence of mind by choosing any object, picking a spot on that object and focusing on that spot. As you focus, pay attention to your breathing and how it feels as you breathe in and out.

However, they usually all have one thing in common – their ineffectiveness.  At some point, most of us have attempted to get a grasp on our management of time, but none of the available methods get the job done – and we’re still pressed for time! So why should you try Personal Kanban? Because the Kanban system has been proven to work. Developed by Toyota to streamline production, Kanban worked extremely well, allowing Toyota to reduce production costs while maintaining a high level of quality. Other companies began to adopt the Kanban system – and many of them use it to this day. Personal Kanban is based on that original Kanban, but it’s been customized for your personal use; for instance, you can customize it to fit with any shifts in your lifestyle. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to draw a map of all your goals and tasks – both at home and at work – and to visualize them as they move toward completion. Personal Kanban puts an end to procrastination and enables you to regain control of your time. By reading these blinks, you’ll also learn  about the connection between Piggly Wiggly and a balanced life; why Personal Kanban is much better than deadlines and to-do lists; and what unfinished tasks can do to your mind. Have you ever been overloaded with work, stressed out and struggling to find a free moment to kick back and relax? At times like this, even simple pleasures such as meeting friends for a drink seem like a far-off impossibility. Why does this happen? It all has to do with how we separate our work time from our personal time, a tendency that disturbs our work-life balance. It does this because our personal life and our work life are inseparable parts of the same life. In an ideal world, both aspects of your life are meaningful to you, but a problem arises when you allocate all your time and energy to planning just one part of your life.  For instance, while you might find it silly to jot down a reminder to hang out with friends, you probably readily write to-do lists for work, a fact that may lead to your pursuing work goals until day’s end, at which point you have no energy for socializing.  But that’s not the only problem. When you treat your life and work as separate entities, you risk permanently forgoing life-changing goals, like living abroad or more ethically. That’s because goals like that require taking action in both your work and your personal life. So, if you don’t plan out your goals with both these sides in mind, you likely won’t achieve them.  For example, living a healthier life requires more than exercising and eating a few pieces of fruit. To truly achieve better health, you’ll need to reduce stress by doing things like taking regular breaks from work.  Okay – so you’re ready to plan for both sides of your life. But how do you do it? With the Personal Kanban. A tool that will help you visualize and plan your to-dos as well as your activities, the Personal Kanban will also put you on the road to achieving your long-term goals.  While visiting America, the thing that most impressed Taiichi Ohno, a Toyota engineer, was a trip to the local supermarket. He’d never seen such perfectly stocked shelves. The supermarket, instead of ordering and stocking vast quantities of everything, had on hand only what their customers tended to purchase. Ohno realized that such an approach could greatly improve Toyota’s assembly line – and thus Kanban, aimed at optimizing industrial production, was born.  Since Ohno’s goal was to cut costs while maintaining the quality of the finished product, the obvious area to target was inventory; storing things is expensive and doesn’t mean better cars.  So how did Toyota tackle this problem? To cut warehousing costs they started making cars on demand. And to streamline production, Ohno designed a billboard-like display system showing the workflow of the entire factory; instead of waiting around for assignments, employees could simply glance at the billboard and know what was next. As a result, tasks were tackled faster and fewer managers were required to control workflow. The method worked so well that companies everywhere began using it. It went down in history as “Kanban” – or “Billboard.” The Personal Kanban emerged out of this organizational Kanban. Of course, your life doesn’t work like an assembly line, so this personal system is more flexible, easier to adapt to your changing life and objectives. It works like this. Personal Kanban relies on two principles: The first is to visualize your workflow by using a board to diagram all your tasks. This helps you simultaneously monitor everything you need to do and easily ascertain your next task. Instead of mentally juggling several pressing tasks, your Kanban lets you quickly weigh the tradeoffs of each.  The second principle of Kanban is to keep your work-in-progress (WIP) to a minimum. There’s no need to put more on your plate than you can realistically handle. Now that you know what Kanban is, it’s time to set yours up! So, you’ve decided that your life would benefit from improved organization. Well, all you need is a pen, a whiteboard and some sticky notes to start mapping your workflow and boosting your productivity. How do you do this? First off, you’ll need to decide what medium you’ll use to create your Kanban and where you’ll put it. Remember, your Personal Kanban is designed to visualize the flow of your work, so while you can draw it on your computer, it’s much more effective to use a medium that can be put somewhere you see every day. A whiteboard is ideal – you can put in your office or in a prominent location at home.  Once you’ve chosen your medium and location, you’re just three steps away from setting up your Personal Kanban.  First, draw out three or more columns that correspond to different stages of progress. These could be things like READY, meaning work waiting to be tackled; DOING, for work-in-progress; and DONE, for completed tasks. As you work on and complete tasks, you’ll see them move from column to column. The second step is to set up your backlog by writing down every goal you’ve ever had but haven’t been able to tackle. One way to do this is by using sticky notes to write down every one of your future goals – anything from calling your mother to moving to Hawaii. Step three is to decide the maximum number of work-in-progress tasks you can handle at once. Keep in mind that people are more effective when they don’t have too many things to do at once. You can find your magic number by choosing one at random – three, for instance – and testing it out to discover your sweet spot over time.  And just like that your Personal Kanban is ready to go. Now it’s time to put it into action! Now that you’ve set up your Personal Kanban, you’re ready to start using it. Your first job is to take on new tasks and get your workflow going. Do so by following step four and five: Step four is to pick the most pressing tasks from your backlog and place them in your workflow. When doing this, it’s key to put the most urgent tasks into the READY column of your board.  Step five is to begin pulling – moving, as time allows, high-priority tasks from READY to DOING as your WIP space frees up. Pulling is distinct from pushing because instead of work being shoved onto your plate by someone else – your boss, for instance – who disregards your current capacity, you’re personally in charge of deciding when you’re ready for more.  With step six, the action really begins as you start tackling the tasks in your DOING column. Remember that moving things to DONE will always be your sweet reward. In fact, the DONE column is actually essential, because, as Soviet psychologist B. Zeigarnik found, people usually remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. Therefore, the human brain needs some closure to help it let go of unfinished jobs. The motivation you’ll derive from the prospect of moving an item to DONE is the icing on the cake! Now that you’re using your Kanban, step seven is to assess your progress in different areas, an easy task given the system’s visual nature. Kanbans work by visualizing every step and task (for instance, you could color code different projects or work types); therefore, it’s easy to spot and fix problems. For example, say you realize that creative tasks are a total breeze for you, but accounting work drags on and on. Identifying this problem is a major step toward finding a solution. Maybe your office is simply too loud for math and all you need is earplugs! And that’s it, your Personal Kanban is up and running. Now what can it do for you? It can be hard to turn down juicy new projects, but sometimes saying no is the best thing you can do. Thankfully, Personal Kanban can make you more effective by limiting the number of things on your to-do list. Why’s this so key? Because overburdening your brain decreases your productivity; like traffic clogging a freeway, too many duties clog up your working memory. But productivity isn’t the only thing you lose when your brain is overtaxed. Your creativity suffers, too, and you’ll become easily distracted and more prone to procrastination.  Personal Kanban protects you from these issues by limiting your work-in-progress to a realistic load.  Another way Personal Kanban helps you is by tracking your activities and mastering your time. For instance, do you ever feel like time is disappearing without anything to show for it? A glance at your DONE column might be enough to show you just how many small, easily forgotten tasks you’ve actually accomplished.  But that’s not the only way Kanban helps you control your time. It also lets you compare the pros and cons of different paths. For example, say you’re in school and have a paper to write. You spend too much time on research, resulting in a sadly empty DONE column. However, this visual reminder that you haven’t completed any tasks also makes it easier to see that switching your strategy, perhaps framing your argument after some quick preliminary research, might be a helpful change.  So, Kanban boosts your personal productivity. But it’s also a great tool for groups. For instance, when working in a group, it’s common to wonder who did what and what will happen next. Visualizing everybody’s commitments in a Kanban makes questions like these easy to answer. Say you have a Kanban for your household. You’ll know at a glance that it’s time for you to iron, since your son already did the laundry, and that the dog doesn’t need more food because it was fed by your daughter ten minutes ago. Do you remember, back in 2006, when NASA sent the New Horizon space shuttle to Pluto? To get where it was going, the spacecraft needed to correct its trajectory, mid-flight, by a precise 5m/sec. If the shuttle’s path hadn’t been adjusted, it would have missed the planet by 80,000 km! Sometimes small adjustments made early mean major effects down the line. This is good news, because Personal Kanban’s continuous feedback lets you tackle problems while they’re still small. For instance, for that space shuttle, making a small, early correction ensured the desired result with the least disruption.  Since your Kanban is always giving you feedback about your decisions and work, you’ll know well in advance if something needs changing. For example, say you start studying to be an engineer. Your classes are boring and you don’t want to admit it, but it’s hard to deny the snail’s pace at which tasks travel to the DONE column.  Since you can see this problem up front, you have the option to change your major before it’s too late.  But there’s another key feature of Personal Kanban that helps you identify areas in need of change. They’re called retrospectives. Here’s how they work: Start by taking a look at your DONE column to determine how many tasks you work on in an average day and which tasks give you the most grief or pleasure. This process lays bare wasteful and ineffective habits, thereby making it easier to find solutions. For example, while conducting your retrospective, you might realize that you hate filing your taxes, and that, as a result, you always procrastinate right up to tax day. It’s easy to see that hiring an accountant to file your taxes could seriously cut your stress.  So how often should you do a retrospective? It’s up to you, but whether you do it every week or every month it should always be a regular habit.  MIT researchers once conducted an experiment in which three groups of students were required to submit papers; each group had a different deadline. The first group had a clear due date, the second was allowed to choose their own and the third was told to submit their paper anytime during the semester. The results? The group given an exact date got the best grades, while the one that determined their own deadline came in second; the group with no concrete deadline did the worst.  Deadlines can motivate you, because you’re likely to prioritize tasks with a due date; however, they work by pushing you. The students at MIT, for instance, were pushed to submit their papers on the due date, whether they had other priorities or not, and this probably caused them additional stress.  Luckily, Personal Kanban is another effective motivator – and a less stressful one. For instance, any task that’s important, like a class assignment, will already fall in the high-priority category in your backlog, therefore you’ll put it into your DOING column as soon as time allows. In this way, Kanban reduces stress, as the task doesn’t nag at you before you have time to work on it. But it also prevents you from procrastinating.  However, using personal Kanban in this way requires some considerations. For instance, it’s important to keep context in mind; certain jobs become a priority in particular situations, and when context changes, priorities do too. It’s therefore key to update your Kanban as conditions change.  Second, since you’ll be pulling tasks from your backlog, it’s important to keep it as organized as your board. One way to keep it neat is with a time management matrix composed of four quadrants prioritized from urgent to not important.  Now that you’ve got the basics of your Personal Kanban in motion you can personalize it to fit your requirements.  Did you know that Danish designers developed a new type of house with flexible walls, moveable outlets and the ability to change shape as the owner’s desires change? If you have another child, for instance, you can add a room – just like that! If you want to expand your living room, you can move a wall without a second thought. Wouldn’t it be great if life were customizable? Well, Personal Kanban works in the same way.  For example, you can add a TODAY column to your board, maybe before the DOING column, to which you pull tasks for the day. This can be a helpful addition, as people often fail to complete all of a day’s tasks. The TODAY column works by helping you track your achievements and determine your daily capacity. Say you just began teaching. You optimistically pull “mark 60 essays” into your TODAY column and proceed to work until your eyes are bleary, and there are still 30 papers to grade. Now you know how much work you can realistically complete in a day.  But what about when you depend on the actions of others to complete a task?  For work like this you can make an additional column, called PEN, meaning everything in it needs to be signed off by someone else. For example, say one of your tasks in READY is to “schedule house painters.” You pull it into DOING and call the company, but no one picks up and all you can do is leave a voicemail. Instead of letting the task sit in your DOING column, you can move it to PEN until you hear back from the painters.  You can even use Personal Kanban to monitor the amount of time you spend working. Just add a start date when you pull a task into READY; add another when you move it to WIP and yet another when it goes to DONE. By monitoring your progress in this way, you’ll gain a realistic sense of your productivity. The key message in this book: Many people think that work life and personal life are separate spheres. The truth, however, is that they’re interconnected parts of a whole, and in order to accomplish all you want, it’s key to pay equal attention to both. Personal Kanban will help you do this – organizing your to-dos into an easy-to-use visual format that makes planning, monitoring and executing your tasks a snap. Actionable advice: Realistically estimate your workload by accounting for hidden tasks.  The next time you set about estimating your workload, be sure to do it honestly; that means digging up all the “hidden work.” This step is key, as many people simply omit tasks that don’t seem like real work. For instance, a teacher might fail to account for calling parents and cleaning up after school, because she only considers “work” the time she spends teaching. Leaving such auxiliary tasks unaccounted for is a sure way to see time disappear, which will make you feel inefficient, even if you’ve accomplished a lot. Suggested further reading: The Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo The Pomodoro Technique presents a simple yet effective method of structuring your workday. This method helps to overcome your lack of motivation by cutting large or complex tasks into small, manageable chunks. Using these techniques, you will gain more control over your work, thus making you a more effective worker and work more rewarding. Got feedback?

We believe that rushing from one task to the next and juggling multiple priorities shows everyone that we’re productive. But despite this cult of busyness, too many people still feel overworked, disorganized and permanently behind schedule. Where are we going wrong? Luckily, there is a solution. Get ready to discover that everything you thought you knew about productivity and time management is wrong. These blinks will turn conventional wisdom on its head and show you how to stretch your time, your money and your effectiveness. Drawing on the insights and experiences of famed management consultant Rory Vaden, you’ll learn the secrets of achieving more by doing less and uncover powerful techniques to multiply your productive hours.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how successful people avoid being busy; what farmers can teach you about concentration; and why your $5 coffee is really costing you $35. Do you ever feel overwhelmed with the demands on your time? If you do, you’re not alone. Research shows that the time we spend on routine tasks like getting dressed, household chores and eating can take 5 hours! According to a Newsweek report, simply trying to find our belongings takes sixty minutes of the day. Add in a full-time job, and it’s a wonder we get it all done. So, how can we manage our time better?  Surprisingly, the first step is to quit complaining about how much you have to do. For many of us, this is difficult. Rory Vaden, for example, used to take pride in telling people how busy his life was. When they asked, he would sigh and explain how much he had to do. Of course, he was busy. Research finds that the average executive now receives a staggering 116 emails a day. As the cofounder of a global consulting practice, Vaden’s inbox was always brimming with demands on his time.  Nonetheless, looking back, he believes he crafted this image of being busy because it made him feel important. After talking to highly successful people who maximize their productive hours, known as multipliers, he realized that these high achievers never complain about how packed their schedules are. Vaden asked one of these multipliers why they weren’t as busy as he was. She replied that it wasn’t that she didn’t have a lot to do. She just felt there was no point complaining about the demands on her time – that would be a waste of valuable mental energy. Instead of worrying about her to-do list, she gets on with it. After spending some time with these prolific multipliers, Vaden noticed that accepting their packed agendas gave them a more peaceful frame of mind. They might have been busy, but they didn’t seem stressed. Instead, the multipliers took responsibility for their own lives and steered clear of a victim mentality. You can follow suit by remembering that you made the commitments that make demands on your time. By taking ownership of these commitments, you’ll empower yourself to find a solution to your overloaded schedule. You are not a victim of your responsibilities – and you are not too busy to take care of them. Conventional wisdom tells us that less is more. Nonetheless, when trying to become more successful, we tend to think about what we can add to our lives to boost our achievements. We adopt a clever new strategy, for example, or add that productivity-boosting step to our morning routine. But the truth is that adding to your to-do list won’t multiply your time or your success. In fact, the path to productivity lies in eliminating activities from your life.  Of course, this might be easier said than done. Why? Because human nature craves the satisfaction of achievement. Thus, we often engage in trivial activities simply to reassure ourselves that we’ve accomplished something. This explains the common yet pointless practice of completing a random activity and then adding it to our to-do list simply so we can mark it as done! However, the most productive among us are constantly asking ourselves which tasks we can eliminate. Multipliers don’t focus on activities but on results. They know that success is not about the number of tasks you finish, but about how significant those tasks are. Begin multiplying your own time by going through everything you do in a day with an elimination mindset. If you’re struggling, here are a couple of notorious time-wasters just waiting for the shove. First, eliminate television. The typical American watches over 34 hours of TV a week. That’s almost as much time as a 9-to-5 job! Add up all those hours, and you’ll find that the average person spends a full nine years of their life in front of the box. So, unless you’ve already eliminated this unnecessary distraction, you can’t come into work complaining that you’re too busy. Second, eliminate some meetings from your working day. A survey by salary.com found that a whopping 47 percent of respondents believe meetings are their largest time-waster. Next time you receive a meeting invite, ask yourself two key questions: Do I really have to know what will be shared in this meeting? And will I be called on to make decisions in this meeting? If the answer to both is no, then eliminate that pesky time-waster from your schedule. Do you think like a wealthy person or like an average person? You can find out by conducting the following simple thought experiment. When deciding whether to buy a $5 coffee, what do you think about? The average person only considers whether they have $5 in their pocket to spend. Although this approach might initially seem sensible, the wealthy person thinks bigger. Instead, they consider that if they spend this $5 now, that’s money they can’t invest in something else. In other words, having a wealthy mindset means having an investment mindset. Crucially, multipliers make time for themselves the same way that wealthy people make money – with an investment mindset. Let’s take a look at how investment begets both time and money.  If you didn’t spend the $5 on coffee today, you could invest that money at a moderate interest rate of, say, 8 percent. And, thanks to the magic of compound interest, in 30 years that $5 will become $30. Thus, a wealthy person understands that the true cost of that coffee is $35 – the $5 today and the missed opportunity to make $30 in the future. Would you really spend that much money on coffee? Multipliers understand that canny investments can also generate time and money. For example, think of all the hours you spend repeating the same task. This could be sending out the same email to multiple customers or reentering information into a database. How much time could you save by automating all these repetitive processes? Probably a whole lot. Sadly, many businesses don’t have an investment mindset. As a management consultant, the author has heard countless executives say they would love to use more automation, but they can’t afford it. This reluctance might seem reasonable, but the truth is that businesses can’t afford not to invest in automation. Just like the future $30 you forgo if you buy that coffee today, the hidden cost of not investing your money in automation is squandering your time tomorrow.  So don’t waste any more of your future time. Instead, give yourself permission to automate today. Some things in life just need to get done. If you’ve got a task that can’t be eliminated or automated, then it’s important enough to receive human attention. But if you’re a time-poor worker, don’t panic – you might just be able to delegate it instead. Consider everything you do daily, from housework to spreadsheet updates. Now ask yourself: Could someone else do this for me? For most tasks, the answer is probably yes.  So, why don’t more of us save time by delegating? All too often, we worry that the other person won’t meet our exacting standards or complete the work on time. And soon enough, we start telling ourselves the same old story – it’s quicker if I do it. But this probably isn’t true.  Let’s imagine, for example, that you spend five minutes of each working day completing a particular task. Once you decide to delegate that task, you’ll also devote 150 minutes of your time to teach someone how to do it. Why 150 minutes? Well, business school experts advise that for every minute a task takes you to finish, you should invest thirty minutes in training another person to complete it. This is known as the 30x rule.  At this point, you might think it really would be quicker to do the task yourself. But now consider that the time you spend on that five-minute task works out as 1,250 minutes in a 250-day work year. So even if you spend 150 minutes on teaching, you’ll still save yourself 1,100 minutes annually. Many people believe they can’t afford to delegate. After all, no one’s going to work for free. But before you make that decision, remember that time is money, too. If, for example, you earn an annual salary of $100,000 a year, that’s a $40 hourly rate. Thus, delegating those 1,100 minutes will free up more of your time to spend it earning money instead. And provided the other person’s hourly rate is lower than yours, you’ll still turn a profit.  So don’t try to do everything yourself. Use another pair of hands to multiply your time. Visit a lake at sunset, and you may find a fisherman there with a line of freshly caught fish. But take a look during the mid-morning, and you won’t see him catching any fish, no matter how long he stands there. Why? Because fish bite at dusk and dawn, not at 11:00 a.m. This shows that success is not just about taking action or how long you spend doing something. In life, just as in fishing, it’s also about waiting for the right moment. With this in mind, give yourself permission to procrastinate.  But before you start watching TV instead of going to the gym, let’s clarify a few things. The procrastination we’re talking about here isn’t putting off something you should be doing because you don’t want to. Instead, we’re talking about having the patience to wait until the optimal time to act. And as every multiplier knows, patience can save you a lot of time. Let’s consider a business owner who likes to get through her monthly to-do list as quickly as possible. When an order comes in for a product that’s due in a fortnight, she’ll pack it up as soon as she’s off the phone with the customer. But what if that customer calls back to change or cancel their order? In this scenario, she would cost herself time, and possibly money, by unboxing everything and starting all over again. In contrast, if she’d patiently waited until the day before delivery, she could’ve taken the alterations into account and saved herself precious minutes. This story highlights the key reason why patience is so important. It allows you to adapt to unpredictable changes, whether that’s a change in the weather, the stock market or a customer’s requirements. In our fast-paced modern world, things tend to change at breakneck speed. So don’t be scared of a little procrastination, and have the patience to wait and see. During the harvest season, a farmer works a staggering 18 hours a day. Getting ill, tired or taking a career break isn’t an option. She has only a short window in which to pick her crops and secure her livelihood for the rest of the year. The rest of us can learn something from the harvesting farmer. Sometimes, your only option is to focus all your energy on the task at hand. So far, we’ve learned how to multiply your time by eliminating, automating, delegating and procrastinating. But if you can’t do any of those things, then the task must become your priority. When it comes to priorities, the best way to deal with them is to give them your full attention.  In a hectic world, this isn’t always a simple task. But, tellingly, the world’s best multipliers use certain tools to help them focus.  Research by the author’s consulting company discovered that less than 10 percent of people report using a comprehensive written plan for allocating their time each week. However, a whopping 85 percent of multipliers do use this sort of schedule. Why? Because multipliers understand how damaging distractions can be to achieving their priorities, so they exclude them from their rigorous agenda. However, making a schedule and sticking to it isn’t enough. When you sit down to concentrate on your priority, you need to bring your whole mind, not just your body, to the table. Too often, our minds wander instead of focusing on the task in front of us. Let what you’re working on completely absorb your attention. Only by fully concentrating can you truly make something your priority.  Lastly, remember that you can only have one priority at a time. By its very definition, a priority is something that comes before everything else. So don’t start thinking about your family when you sit down to concentrate on a business problem. Although both these things might be your priorities, when you sit down to concentrate on something, it should be your primary focus. Otherwise, it’s not really a priority at all. How much time are you and your colleagues wasting in the workplace? It might be a lot more than you think. A survey of 10,000 people conducted by the author’s consultancy found that the average respondent wastes 2.09 hours on irrelevant activities a day! These shocking statistics prove that time management shouldn’t just be a personal aspiration, but a commercial imperative. Let’s calculate how much all that wasted time costs businesses across the United States. The average American, for example, makes $39,795 annually, which equates to around a $19 hourly wage. So those 2.09 hours add up to a $10,396 cost for employers every year. And that’s just for one employee! But despite the high price of wasted time, companies are often more interested in saving dollars instead. Most businesses would never operate without setting budgets, keeping tabs on their expenses or reviewing their financial statements. In contrast, most businesses have no formal strategy at all for tackling the question of what’s wasting company time. This failure to recognize time as a valuable, finite resource is a huge problem for organizations. After all, your company can always recoup lost dollars, but time, once spent, is gone forever. Luckily, there is a solution. Your company needs to start thinking like a multiplier, and so does every one of its employees. This sea change might not be easy but just think of the benefits. Imagine a workplace where every pointless task is eliminated and activities are delegated to the person with the right set of skills. In this type of business, each team knows when to take action and when to be patient, and individuals focus on their current priority without distractions.  Wouldn’t that be a productive and profitable place to work? If you think so, then start making it happen by being the change you want to see and procrastinating on purpose. Boost your own results and it won’t be long before your colleagues start following your example. The key message in these blinks: Individuals and organizations are wasting their precious time every single day, resulting in huge financial and productivity costs. Regain control of your daily schedule by carefully evaluating your daily activities and determine what can be eliminated, what can be delegated and what should become a current or future priority. Actionable advice: Multiply your lifespan.  One of the most profound ways to make more time for yourself is to take care of your body. After all, if you fail to exercise and eat healthy today, you’re more likely to experience future health problems. So spend some of your precious minutes and dollars on cooking real food every evening, and don’t skip a trip to the gym. Remember, investing in your health today can multiply your years on earth.

Today’s world is shaped by near-limitless connectivity. Even when you’re not in the office, you’re never more than a few seconds away from your email account. Then there’s the old dogma that success is all about grinding out long hours at your desk. Combine the two, and you end up with a work culture that encourages burnout. That’s something Silicon Valley strategist Alex Soojung-Kim Pang knows all about. After years of pushing himself to the limit, he took a sabbatical. Living a life of leisure for a few months wasn’t just a luxury – he quickly realized that he was getting more serious work done than ever before. That got him thinking. What would a different, healthier and saner work culture look like? After sifting through the latest empirical scientific evidence, he came up with an answer: it’d make much more room for rest, relaxation and recovery. As these blinks will show, getting a good night’s sleep, taking a vacation and nurturing your hobbies doesn’t just keep you in top physical and mental health; it also does wonders for creativity, concentration and cognitive performance. In these blinks, you’ll learn why your best work often comes when you’re not thinking; how exercise can boost your cognitive prowess; and why Winston Churchill took time out from running the United Kingdom to paint. Eight hours of work a day sometimes just doesn’t feel like enough. Surely you have to put a longer shift in if you want to become the next New York Times best seller, right? Well, not quite. What really makes the difference isn’t how much you work, but when you work. The best time to get to work is in the morning. If you really want to boost your creative output, you need a routine that starts in the early hours. Getting up at the crack of dawn gives you space to reflect on your work without the hustle and bustle of everyday life getting in the way. Take it from Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip. He’s been getting up at five in the morning every day for the past twenty years. The first thing he does is drink a cup of coffee and eat a protein bar. That’s the perfect breakfast to set him up for the next four hours of drawing, answering emails and taking care of administrative chores. After that, his creative energy is spent so he hits the gym to lift weights. This routine has more than paid off. Dilbert has been syndicated by two thousand newspapers in 65 countries. Adams has also written five comic books, nine nonfiction titles and produced both a TV show and a movie. The key to his success is spending those first four hours working deliberately, then planning for some downtime afterward. That’s because it’s much more effective to work intensely for a shorter period of time than to work half-heartedly for the whole day. That also frees up more time to pursue your hobbies, go for a walk or just take a nap. Researchers at a music conservatory in Berlin came to the same conclusion when they looked into students’ practicing habits in the 1980s. All the best young musicians practiced for four hours a day and slept an hour longer than their peers. Like Adams, they worked most intensely in the morning. After that, they napped and did some lighter practicing in the evening. You can put that insight into practice even if you don’t have the luxury of clocking in and out of your job as you please. Just make sure you’re fully focused on your work in the morning and take a break at lunch to rejuvenate. What’s the best way to recover from an energy-depleting mental workout? Well, there are two proven ways to recharge your creative batteries: walking or taking a short nap. Let’s start with walking. Taking a stroll has been shown to enhance your relationship with your work and boost your creativity. That’s because it’s a brilliant way of tapping into your subconscious – the part of your mind in which many of your best ideas develop. Take it from William Rowan Hamilton, a nineteenth-century mathematician. He developed his most famous postulate in the field of algebra while walking along Ireland’s Royal Canal with his wife. He later explained how he came to his idea, stating that an “undercurrent of thought” had suddenly revealed itself after “a spark flashed forth.” Indeed, walking is closely related to creativity. That was demonstrated by a study carried out at Stanford University in 2015. The researchers wanted to test students’ divergent thinking skills – a type of thinking aimed at generating creative ideas by exploring as many different possible solutions to a problem as possible. The study showed that the participants who’d spent their time on a treadmill or taking a walk outside had much higher scores than those who’d taken the test sitting at a desk. Another great way to rejuvenate those grey cells is to take a midday nap. Grabbing a quick siesta isn’t just psychically restorative – it also helps foster information retention and emotional control. Olaf Lahl, a sleep scientist based at the University of Düsseldorf in Germany, carried out a study in 2008 that showed how catching some z’s supports the brain’s ability to retain new data. Lahl divided the participants into two groups and tasked them with memorizing 30 unfamiliar words in two minutes. One group had been given the chance to take a nap before the test, while the other had been awake the whole time. The former group recalled a significantly higher number of words than the latter. There’s a saying that it’s best to quit while you’re ahead. It’s a great motto to remember when you’re working. Choosing the right moment to stop greatly supports your creativity. That’s because there’s nothing worse than overextending yourself. If you’ve just nailed a brilliant scene in your screenplay, don’t try to top it in the very next scene. Leave the next line half-finished and come back to it tomorrow. Who knows what your subconscious will have come up with by then. This is especially important when you’ve come up with a new idea. Take it from writer Ernest Hemingway. He was convinced that incubation was the key to creative work. His advice to budding writers was to “always stop when you know what’s going to happen next.” Taxing your brain with conscious thought tires you out before you’ve even started work. So let that idea sit awhile and take a break, or switch to a different task. But don’t just take Hemingway’s word for it. In a recent study, researchers at the University of Sydney’s Center for the Mind showed how beneficial picking the right moment to stop working can be. They tasked two groups of students to come up with as many creative uses for a piece of paper as possible. One group worked on the task without interruption, while the other group switched to a different analytical task before returning to the original puzzle. The second group came up with far more solutions than the first. The point to remember is that just because you’ve clocked out for the day doesn’t mean your brain has as well. In fact, your brain is still busy coming up with new ideas. You just need to give them time to mature. When you next sit down at your desk, you’ll be amazed at how much they’ve grown! Beauty sleep? More like brain sleep! Sleep it off isn’t just a miracle cure for hangovers, bad days at the office and break-ups; it also fights brain toxins. In fact, sleep helps repair your whole body. That’s because while you sleep, your body is restoring depleted energy levels and repairing or growing cells. Your mind isn’t idle either. It spends the night reviewing your day’s experience, filing memories and subconsciously working on problems that have been bothering you. All that happens during various cycles of sleep. Stage 4 and REM deep sleep, for example, are the most important phases when it comes to brain growth and memory consolidation. Stage 4 sleep, also known as “slow wave sleep,” is when your body releases a growth hormone called GHRH, which is used to repair bruises, fight infections and replace old cells. REM, in contrast, is when your body produces myelin, a protective fat that’s vital for healthy neural function and memory. Proper rest can also help protect you against various degenerative conditions. A 2013 study carried out at the University of Rochester found that mice removed the toxin beta-amyloid – a protein linked to Alzheimer’s – twice as quickly when they were sleeping. Getting a proper night’s rest is also vital if you want to avoid the poor decision-making and serious physical illnesses associated with sleep deprivation. A 2004 survey revealed that American pilots serving in Iraq had been awake for up to 36 hours while bombing enemy positions. Those kinds of grueling shifts were responsible for all sorts of mishaps. Around 64 percent of all fatalities in the first week of the Iraq War were due to accidents and friendly-fire incidents, which were attributed to fatigue. Night shift workers are also likely to suffer from the adverse effects of sleep deprivation. Missing out on sleep disrupts their circadian rhythms, leading to health complications ranging from ulcers to heart disease and breast cancer. Other documented effects include higher rates of hypertension, obesity and diabetes. In every company, there’s that guy who’s clocked in every single day and hasn’t taken one vacation day in the last 15 years. Although this is often celebrated as a great example of hard work and dedication, it’s not healthy. In fact, as we’ll soon find out, he’s probably on the verge of a burnout. Like sleep, holidays are vital to your health and happiness. Vacation is when you wind down and let your body and mind recover. The data compiled by the Framingham Heart Study, a longitudinal study that looked at female homemakers between 1948 and 1991, shows that the participants who only took one holiday every six years were twice as likely to have a heart attack as those who vacationed twice a year. Then there’s a survey of 971 employees carried out by Oxford Economics in 2015. That showed that unused vacations cost companies $224 billion a year. Even worse is what happens in the workplace. Employees lose interest in their work, become less empathetic in their dealings with clients and customers and are much more prone to depression, burnout and even suicide. It’s clear to see how important recovery is. Now, let’s look at how you can maximize your rest time. According to German sociologist Sabine Sonntag, there are four factors to look out for: relaxation, control, mastery experiences and mental detachment. Relaxation is pretty much exactly what you think it is. Close your eyes and imagine a laid-back weekend at the beach or in a spa, and you’ll know what the term means. Control is a bit more complicated. Basically, this refers to how long you need to rest to fully recover. Sonntag points out that this varies from situation to situation. Workers with a large number of office, family and household commitments beyond their control, for example, need longer than workers with more control over their schedules. Mastery experiences are mentally stimulating, challenging and rewarding tasks you’re good at – think of chess or playing an instrument. These are great ways to unwind because they’re so absorbing. Finally, there’s detachment. That’s all about getting away from your everyday routine both literally and in spirit. Spending a week in Italy or a long weekend in the mountains reduces your stress and susceptibility to burnout. What do Rhodes scholars, Nobel Peace Prize winners and footballers all have in common? Well, they all know that physical exercise is great for both the mind and the body. That’s because intellectual rigor and athleticism go hand in hand. Take football player Byron “Whizzer” White, who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Lions in the 1930s. Or Pat Haden, a 1970s LA Rams player, and Myron Rolle, who played for the Tennessee Titans and the Pittsburgh Steelers between 2010 and 2012. All three were distinguished Rhodes scholars. White even went on to become a Supreme Court justice. In fact, academic excellence is often accompanied by physical fitness. Marie Curie, a scientist who shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics, and won her own for Chemistry in 1911, was an avid cyclist. She spent her honeymoon touring France on her bike with her husband. Sports are also great for your mental health. That’s something Nelson Mandela knew better than most. After the apartheid government imprisoned him on Robben Island in 1962, he kept up the strict daily fitness regimen of a boxer. Up to his release in 1988, he ran on the spot for 45 minutes as well as completing 100 push-ups and 200 sit-ups every day. It was that routine that prevented the government from achieving its aim of breaking Mandela. As he put it, “I worked better and thought more clearly when I was in good physical condition.” The close relationship between exercise and cognitive performance has been proven many times over. A 2015 German-Finnish study, for example, scanned the brains of overweight and obese participants before and after a three-month weight-loss and fitness course. The grey and white matter in their brains, which protects the central nervous system, increased in volume as the participants became more physically fit. Scientists have also found that exercise helps the body produce neurotrophins – proteins key to neuron growth and formation. Then there’s memory. Intense aerobic activity stimulates the development of smaller blood vessels, which can deliver oxygenated blood to your brain much more efficiently. That’s good news. A 2012 study found that as your maximum oxygen capacity increases, so too does your episodic memory. Did you know that Winston Churchill loved painting when he wasn’t determining the fate of the world? Like physical exercise, art is a type of deep play, as well as an obvious way of tapping into your creativity. So, what is deep play? Well, it’s basically any activity that’s mentally absorbing, provides a new context for your skills and gives a deep sense of satisfaction as well as a connection to your past. For Churchill, that was oil painting – especially landscapes and seascapes. What he loved most was how engaging it was to sit in front of a blank canvas. In his book Painting as a Pastime, he wrote that he knew of no other leisure activity that “more entirely absorbs the mind.” Deep play is a way of testing your existing skills of observation, strategy and problem-solving in a low-stakes context. Unsurprisingly, Churchill likened painting to military strategy, claiming it was “like fighting a battle.” But deep play also provides respite. It’s as satisfying as work, but less hectic. That means you can really enjoy the small details. Churchill loved the kaleidoscope of colors, for example, and took great pleasure in something as simple as squeezing paints out of their tubes. The statesman took up painting in 1915, the second year of the First World War, shortly after ordering the Allied attack on Gallipoli, Turkey. It was a decision that resulted in devastating losses and threatened Churchill’s entire career. Painting, he later said, “came to my rescue” when he was at his lowest. It was a therapeutic outlet in a moment of deep personal and political crisis. Painting might not be for you, of course, but there are plenty of other activities that offer the same benefits. So try chess, mountain climbing or cooking – anything that you find deeply rewarding is fair game! The key message in these blinks: Work and rest are the yin and yang of happiness. That’s sometimes forgotten in a culture that values overwork. But taking time out to recover and rejuvenate is key to a productive and enriching life. Getting a good night’s sleep, regular exercise, midday naps and vacations all nurture your creativity and set you up for success.  Actionable advice: Take a hike, literally! And don’t forget to bring your business plan. Getting enough exercise doesn’t mean you always have to hit the gym. Walking isn’t just good for you; it’s also easy to combine with your work. Take it from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He’s said to use walks as an opportunity to discuss business, win over new recruits and hatch deals with the founders of start-ups that the tech behemoth is planning on taking over. Got feedback?

If you’re like most other people, probably a lot. Whether it’s dragging home useless things from a Sunday flea market, or buying yet another electronic gadget that you don’t need, most of us suffer from the same thing: stuffocation. This trend is not as harmless as it might seem. Buying more and more things, and hoarding them all in your home, doesn’t just make it harder to stay organized; as these blinks will show you, having so much stuff actually has the potential to kill you. For a long time, materialism and consumption have been the reigning doctrines, not just as a path to personal happiness, but as the engines that drive the economy. However, this is starting to change as more and more people around the world find alternative ways to live beyond a state of constant consumption. So what are these alternative lives, and what would a world beyond stuff look like? These blinks will show you. In these blinks, you’ll learn why materialism has seen its heyday come and go; how you get people to pay 50 pounds to watch a movie; and how the economy can thrive without today’s levels of consumption. Is your cellar or spare room cluttered with things you never use? Do you have junk-filled drawers that you can’t even open because they’re so jammed? If so, you suffer from stuffocation – and chances are all the things you have no longer make you happy. For a long time, happiness was widely considered to be determined by people’s belongings, and how many of them they had. But those days are over; owning more and more stuff no longer holds value for us. The reality is, “more” means having more things to organize and worry about. Materialism has become overwhelming.  In 1979, four out of five people in the United Kingdom, France and West Germany agreed with the notion that material things make us happy. These days, that same statistic is only about one in two, meaning that about half of the population today has had enough of so much stuff.  But how did we come to love stuff in the first place? Well, our minds evolved to be conscious of the threat of scarce resources, so gathering things was important. But in today’s abundant world, we don’t need to worry about this at all. We now have to change the way we think. There are different reasons for our turning away from materialism. Ask a political scientist or a philosopher, for example, and you’ll get different responses.  Environmentalists are bucking materialistic values in favor of the environment; political scientists stress that most people care less about basic necessities such as food and shelter than they do about post-materialistic needs such as freedom of speech; and economists emphasize that rising costs and stagnating incomes are making us less materialistic, since we have less money for shopping. But no matter who you speak to, there is a growing trend toward a new idea of happiness – that which prioritizes the enjoyment of experiences over possessions.  Do the piles of stuff you have ever make you anxious? What about not having the stuff that other people have? Even the thought of organizing all your stuff probably has you pulling your hair out from time to time. But you’re not alone. One day, British philosopher Jeremy Bentham noticed something as he was enjoying his morning coffee: the first cup he relished, but the second didn’t really satisfy him. You can probably relate to this feeling – a small amount of something is good, but you can also have too much of a good thing.  Material goods have come to substitute our craving for meaning and status, and our consumer culture has become a kind of pseudo-religion. But now, since so many products are mass-produced, their meaning has been stripped away and they no longer excite or inspire us. Even more problematic is these products’ direct connection to status anxiety. Since 1979, rates of mental illness in developed countries have doubled. Our mass consumerism causes mass depression, and our mounting piles of stuff offer a direct route to unhappiness.  As if sparking mental illness wasn’t bad enough, having too much stuff can also be deadly! We can all think of a person who never throws things away, and stores stuff they never use in basements, attics and containers. This hoarding behavior is a surprisingly widespread problem; new studies have revealed that between two and six percent of people in developed countries participate in it. But hoarding can be life-threatening. The biggest threat during a fire, for instance, is flashovers. Flashovers occur when so much heat builds up in a confined space that everything within it spontaneously combusts. The more stuff we have, the higher the risk of this happening and the quicker it can happen. Studies in Melbourne have found that 30 years ago, flashovers would occur between 28 and 29 minutes after a fire had started. Nowadays, this number is closer to three to four minutes because of all the stuff we keep in our homes. When demand escalates, supply has to match it. Overconsumption needs overproduction to feed it, and this is very clearly demonstrated throughout US history. In the 60 years following the Civil War, the American population increased by a factor of three, from 35 million to 114 million. At the same time, the production of goods increased between 12 and 14 times. This disparity had to be dealt with, or radical production cuts would need to come into effect, leaving many unemployed or even causing an economic collapse. In the 1920s, addressing this gap between production and consumption was one of the major challenges faced by the US. Those associated with economist John Maynard Keynes and industrialist W. K. Kellogg opted for cutting people’s work hours, thereby producing fewer goods and leaving more time for leisure. But others, such as President Herbert Hoover or General Motors CEO Alfred Sloan, had another solution: consume more. Previously, prosperity had been considered a direct result of saving money and spending less. Now, the push to spend more fed a virtuous cycle of more jobs, and higher wages and benefits for everyone. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, this materialistic model of prosperity proliferated across the globe. Materialism and the notion of consumption as a solution to overproduction were dominant principles throughout the 20th century. But these same ideas have become the root causes of the 21st century’s most pressing problems.  A significant proportion of the climate change occurring today, for instance, comes from burning waste. This waste most often consists of cheaply made, oil-based products made for brief consumption rather than lasting joy. Rest assured, however, we can all change this. In the 1930s, the elite decided that consuming more was the way to go. Today we face another crossroads – but now, more of us can speak and be heard.  So what can you do to overcome stuffocation? There are three approaches you can try: minimalism, a simpler life or setting your life up for medium chill. Minimalism basically involves sifting through your possessions and eliminating the majority of your accumulated stuff. A handy way to do this is to put all your stuff in boxes for 21 days, and only open them when necessary. You’ll find that many of the boxes will remain untouched, and that you could easily get rid of the stuff you hardly use. With this minimalistic approach, not only are you helping limit environmental harm, but you also don’t have to work as much, since you consume less.  Another approach is to opt for a simpler life. People pursuing a simpler life might move to the countryside and completely refuse modern consumer goods that even a minimalist might buy, like an iPad or a new car. While a minimalist is still likely to live in a modern home while owning fewer things, someone choosing a simpler life opts to live with even less.  This route isn’t easy, and a lot of time is dedicated to just surviving with the most basic necessities. As a result, a simpler life is seen by many as too boring or too difficult. Even so, it remains an option for the few who can handle it. A more popular approach is to go for what environmentalist David Roberts calls medium chill. Imagine being offered a promotion, but turning it down. Perhaps you’re fine with letting other people speed ahead of you in the rat race; you’re happy to settle with what you already have. This is medium chill. It’s not about abstaining from material goods, but it implies opting for more free time and less work.  However, medium chill runs counter to the “big chill” that some go for, which entails working more than 80 hours per week until you hit your 40s, and then selling your company in order to retire and do nothing. Should you spend your bonus on your next vacation or splurge on a new car? A concert or a new outfit? These are questions of whether to do or to have. Let’s make the decision a little easier: having is not all it’s cracked up to be. In a 2003 study by psychologists Gilovich and van Boven, participants were asked to think of experiential and material purchases they had made, and were then asked questions about how happy it made them and how much it contributed to happiness in their life. The results showed that experiences bring people more happiness than material possessions. The cure for stuffocation, then, is experientialism. Experiences hold a higher value than material possessions for a number of reasons. Experiences, even negative ones like that camping trip where you endured a week of torrential rain, can be reinterpreted in a positive way. Perhaps, for example, that same trip was also a bonding experience for you and your family. Experiences contribute more to our identities than possessions because they allow us to grow and develop.  Experiences are also more difficult to compare with one another than belongings. While it might be easy to see which new car is more expensive or whose laptop is superior, it’s tough to argue about whether a holiday in Thailand is better than a trip to Provence. With experiences, you get far more benefits and personal growth – regardless of whether it was a great time or not! While experientialism can be considered post-materialistic, it is not to be confused with hippie culture. Experientialism doesn’t reject materialistic values as the hippies did, but instead aims to transcend them. Experientialists are happy to enjoy what they need, but they don’t chase after status, meaning or happiness through material possessions.  Since they don’t view material consumption and experiences as black and white extremes, they are still quite happy to exist within mainstream society. Experientialism is a widely embraced philosophy. People from all walks of life love taking long trips, going skydiving, eating great food and swimming in the sea.  But experientialism does have its downfalls. As experientialism can itself lead to elevated social status, it can unfortunately also lead to status anxiety. Philosopher Alain de Botton stresses that this status anxiety is a real issue. As we tire of all our stuff, the new fear is one of missing out on an experience. Four out of ten people aged between 18 and 34 in the US and the UK now feel this new social pressure. The new emphasis we place on experience can be seen everywhere, from the immense popularity of live music and festivals, to increasing spending on holidays and tourism. Even the growing prevalence of e-books instead of physical copies reflects an overall trend: people care more about the reading experience itself than the ability to display books on their shelves. We can also see this trend toward experience and away from materialism in policy decisions worldwide. How well a country performs is no longer measured by GDP alone; more and more indices are instead expressing progress in terms of quality of life or the well-being of inhabitants, illustrated by measures like the Human Development Index and the Index of Economic Well-Being.  The trend toward experientialism is global in its scope. While many newly industrializing countries, such as China, Vietnam and Brazil, are now in, or are at least approaching, a phase of mass consumption, the new and rising middle classes aren’t just reaping the benefits of materialism – they’re also being faced with its disadvantages, such as resource scarcity, environmental damage and status anxiety.  The rapidly expanding overconsumption in these countries is paving the way toward stuffocation, and citizens of these countries will soon come to a crossroads, with one way pointing toward experientialism. These countries, too, will come to understand experiences as the new luxury. While they can be alright for some, minimalism or leading a simpler life don’t really fit with today’s economic system. Experientialism, on the other hand, does. Companies trying to sell products today can no longer stand above the rest simply by making the most noise or through flashy advertising, as used to be the case. Consumers now crave status and experience, so brands who want to stay ahead of the curve will need to keep this in mind.  Our economy needs people to spend in order to function. In fact, consumer spending constitutes around 65 percent of the British economy and up to 70 percent to the US economy. Consuming less would put jobs at risk, and prosperity in traditional terms would suffer.  But experientialism is not anti-consumption – it’s a different kind of consumption. Our economy needs to transform into an experience economy. So what would an experience economy look like? It would offer memorable experiences.  One example is the Secret Cinema in London. Here, a movie is shown at a special location with an added touch: the audience dresses up, and the staff take on roles that match with the movie. Because it offers such an immersive experience, moviegoers are willing to spend around 50 pounds to take part in it.  The global economy has already started following the experiential trend; if we want to keep selling services and products, we need this trend to continue. Apple are particularly adept at making shopping an experience. Buying an Apple product is not just about the product itself – you are buying an experience.  Apple stores were some of the first in the world in which customers could try out all the products themselves. Apple understood the importance of user experience in order to get more customers, and they even plan the experience of opening up the packaging around a new iPhone or MacBook.  Companies are also doing away with clutter. Puma have produced shoe bags that simply disintegrate after three minutes when placed under water, making for less clutter and simultaneously providing an interesting experience. The key message in this book: We have far too much stuff, and our possessions have become overwhelming. But this is changing as more and more people opt for experiences over things as the new way to live a meaningful life. This trend is not only a cure for the problems – and sometimes crises – that stem from materialism, but it can also help boost the economy. Actionable advice: Do you really need to own it? The next time you’re contemplating a new product, find out if there is some alternative way to access it, borrow it or use it in a more resource-friendly way. Change the way you look at the price tag.  The next time you look at the price of that new phone you think you should upgrade to, ask yourself what you could do with the same amount of money in terms of a holiday, or signing up for a course you’ve always wanted to take.

He’d reached the true elite, achieving epic results in both professional and personal spheres. He was a man who would leave a legacy for the world. But the secret to his success was a surprising one. He attributed his success not to his natural talents, nor to the hours he had invested in his work. He attributed it to a revolutionary morning routine, built around rising at 5 a.m. and following a little known formula designed to turbocharge his mental focus, build his physical fitness and encourage him to be his best self day in and day out. With these blinks, you too can join the 5am club. You can learn how to rise each day and embrace the solitude, silence and lack of distraction the early hours of the morning can offer. Read on, and you’ll learn how true elite performers in all walks of life get ahead by making the most of a time of day that others use to sleep, waste time watching the news, or browse social media. In these blinks, you’ll learn: why freedom from distraction helps you to achieve better results; why slowing down your brain through transient hypofrontality is so important; and how to build the routine of an elite performer. This is the fictitious tale of a curious group of people: A depressed entrepreneur, in need of revitalization; a frustrated artist, trying to refuel his creativity and develop a legacy; and a billionaire with a string of successes behind him and a desire to pass on the knowledge of how to live an extraordinary life. The three met at a personal optimization conference addressed by a legendary business guru, the Spellbinder, someone renowned for his ability to weave magic and captivate his audience with the power of his insights. The billionaire approached the entrepreneur and the artist after the Spellbinder’s speech had finished but they didn’t know that he was a billionaire. The billionaire was disguised as a poor man, a habit he had developed to remind himself that money isn’t everything. The only clue to his actual wealth was his expensive watch. The impoverished-looking billionaire told the two that he’d made a fortune thanks to the Spellbinder, who’d taught him that while many people wish that extraordinary things will happen to them, truly elite performers learn that they can make extraordinary things happen themselves. The entrepreneur and the artist became more and more curious about this mysterious man who talked like he was a guru himself. They listened as the billionaire explained how the Spellbinder – who, in fact, was the billionaire’s personal mentor – had taught him one thing that was more important than anything else. What was it? That the most reliable way to generate the best results in your personal and professional life is to build a world-beating morning routine. Being a generous man, the billionaire made an incredible offer. If the entrepreneur and artist wanted to come hang with him at his beach house in Mauritius, he would teach them the secrets of a world-class morning routine. All they needed to do was meet the next morning at 5 a.m.. The entrepreneur and the artist were a little skeptical the next morning, but it started to soften when a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce collected them and delivered them to a hangar containing a sleek, ivory-colored private jet, which bore the logo: “5AC.” The entrepreneur asked the chauffeur what the logo meant, and he explained that it stood for “The 5am Club.” And so began their journey toward understanding a revolutionary morning routine and a whole new outlook on life with the potential to transform everything for the better. Early the next morning, the billionaire told the entrepreneur and artist how getting up at 5 a.m. was the way he had learned to escape mediocrity and achieve greatness. Getting up at 5 a.m. had promoted his creativity, doubled his energy, and tripled his productivity. How? Well, the billionaire told them, many true greats throughout history, from novelist John Grisham to composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have understood that the isolation that comes from getting up at 5 a.m. has a multiplying effect. All of us have limited mental capacity or cognitive bandwidth. And throughout the day, our attention is given to more and more things: work, the news, interaction with others and social media. Our bandwidth gets used up by all of these so, by lunchtime, we can’t really concentrate on anything at all. By constantly shifting our focus from one thing to another, we give nothing enough attention. But if you get up at 5 a.m., you have a golden opportunity to focus on one high-value activity without your brain getting distracted. This focus is further enhanced by the concept of transient hypofrontality, which means, in a nutshell, that at 5 a.m., you are well placed to achieve a state of flow in your thinking. That’s because, the billionaire explained, when you are enjoying a peaceful 5 a.m. start, the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which handles rational thought, temporarily shuts down. So your tendency to analyze, stress and worry about things is impaired. At the same time, the peace of daybreak stimulates the production of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. The result? You naturally enter a state of flow: of being fully energized, focused and in the zone. Flow is the elite mind-set that all top performers, from violinists to scientists, inhabit in their finest moments. So you’ll find that if you get up at 5 a.m., you’ll be more focused and more productive for the entire day. If you want another reason why joining the 5am club is a good idea, consider this: to get the results of the top 5 percent of elite performers, you need to do what 95 percent of entrepreneurs, artists and other people are unwilling to do. Most people aren’t willing to get up at 5 a.m. so if you are, you have a huge competitive advantage. Now let’s take a look at how to not just achieve great things, but to become a true historymaker, a person whose achievements change the world. On a dazzling morning in Mauritius, the entrepreneur, the artist, and the billionaire gathered by the sea. A school of squirrelfish swam through the crystal clear waters. In this beautiful setting, the billionaire recounted the four focuses of the great historymakers. Firstly, he said, the greatest people are defined not by their natural talent, but by the extent to which they capitalize. According to the billionaire, self-discipline and perseverance always trump talent and giftedness. So rather than thinking you don’t have what it takes, capitalize on the gifts you’ve got to make a difference. Secondly, the billionaire explained, freedom from distraction is key. Too many people today waste hours on addictive but hollow technology and social media. If you want to win, you need to focus, simplify, and concentrate. That means becoming a purist, concentrating on a few amazing work projects rather than many good ones. And in day-to-day life, it means stripping out everything that distracts you from a relentless focus on what’s most important. So turn off your notifications and cancel pointless meetings that are taking you away from activities that really add value. Gain a distraction-free hour each morning to focus on what’s important by joining the 5am club. Thirdly, the truly great understand the power of day-stacking. That means that small things done daily are way more important than big things done once in a while. Consider enhancing one ability or skill by just one percent every day. It’s a small change, but over a year it amounts to a 365 percent improvement! Finally, the billionaire shared the final focus of historymakers: personal mastery practice. According to psychologist Anders Ericsson, a person must invest at least 2.75 hours of daily practice in a skill for ten years for the first signs of an elite-level of mastery to appear. So if you want to master yourself, you should spend your first hour each morning working deeply on you, your mind-set and also your approach to health, spirituality and love. The entrepreneur and artist now understood much more clearly how the truly elite stay ahead, so the billionaire said it was time to take things to the next level: It was time for them to understand how to cultivate their best selves. How often, asked the billionaire, have you heard a guru talk about improving your mind-set? We hear it all the time – think optimistic thoughts, and you’ll improve your life. But, said the billionaire, strolling along a white sand beach with his pupils, what these gurus don’t tell you is that your Mindset is just one of four “interior empires.” If you’re only working on your Mindset, you’re ignoring your Healthset, your Heartset, and your Soulset. That’s like only polishing 25 percent of a picture! Your Heartset is your emotional life and well-being. It’s important because, even with a world-class Mindset, you can’t deliver intellectually if your emotional life is a mess. As Sigmund Freud noted, “unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and they will come forth later in uglier ways.” So focus on a healthy Heartset and you’ll soon feel the difference. Next, give your Healthset – your physical health – some attention. One of the key ways to get ahead in life is longevity. As the billionaire jokingly pointed out, you can’t be a titan of industry if you’re dead. Committing to optimal fitness allows you a couple of extra ultra-healthy and productive decades to build a greater legacy. What’s more, elite performers realize that every day becomes far better with exercise. It ignites your energy, dissolves your stress and expands your joy. But even that isn’t enough, as there’s another interior empire to cultivate. Your Soulset, the billionaire explained, is your spirituality. Too often, everyday life pulls us toward the superficial and the material. So take some time in the quiet moments of the early morning to remember who you truly are. Bond with the hero inside of you. In the silence of the dawn, meditate on what you have to offer the world. Focus on your Soulset, and you’ll reconnect with the very best part of yourself. The entrepreneur remarked that this framework really changed his perception of himself, leading him to ask how he could use the first hour of the day to effectively apply it. The billionaire replied, telling him that he was ready to hear about the 20/20/20 formula, but not in Mauritius, but in The Eternal City – Rome. It was time to be inspired by the passion of the Roman people, the city’s architecture, and its divine food. Standing in the square at the bottom of Rome’s famous Spanish Steps, the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist took in their surroundings. It’s time, the billionaire said, to learn how you can transform your creativity, performance, utility, wealth and productivity. Just rising at 5 a.m. alone won’t do it. You could rise at 5 a.m. and waste an hour scanning social media and checking messages, but that won’t optimize your day. What will is the 20/20/20 formula that says you use 20 minutes to move, 20 minutes to reflect and 20 minutes to grow. The first step is to move – to perform vigorous exercise for 20 minutes. What’s really important is to make yourself sweat. That’s because sweat gets rid of cortisol, the hormone of fear. Sweat generates the protein BDNF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which repairs brain cells and accelerates the formation of new neural connections. So by sweating for 20 minutes, it literally means you’ll think faster! Then, make 5.20-5.40 a.m. a time for reflection with a period of deep peace and solitude. Before the complexity of the day emerges, reflect on what is most important to you. In an age of distraction, of constant notifications and messages, you’ll be amazed what visions, dreams and inspiration drift into your mind when you have a few moments of silence to yourself. Write these thoughts in a journal. Commit your current ambitions, the things you’re grateful for in your life, and your frustrations and disappointments to paper. Doing so will help you understand your vision and let go of toxic, negative energies. Take a few minutes to meditate. Research shows that meditation helps lower cortisol, reducing your stress. It’s a proven way to stay calm, and the great performers of the world are always calm! Now it’s time for the last 20 minutes of your first hour. Here, you need to grow, so take 20 minutes to learn. Study the lives of great achievers by reading their biographies. Learn about human psychology. Watch documentaries on innovation, or listen to audiobooks about business building. One thing every billionaire has in common is a love of learning. So there you have it. A perfect morning routine, to make the hour your own and become a true member of the 5am club. As the city of Rome slowly came to life, the billionaire, entrepreneur and artist ventured down into the depths of the city. As they descended down a dark and dusty tunnel, the billionaire announced that they were in the catacombs – underground passages used as burial grounds by the ancient Romans. The artist asked why they were there and the billionaire explained that they were surrounded by people in a centuries-old-slumber, so it was an appropriate place to discuss the importance of deep sleep. Research has shown that sleep is one of the key factors in predicting life expectancy. How you spend the last hour of your day is almost as important to peak performance as how you spend the first. Too many people today are in a state of sleep deprivation, driven by technology. Research shows that the blue light emitted by our devices reduces levels of melatonin – the chemical that induces sleep. Being in front of a screen before sleep will prevent you from sleeping properly, so turn off your technology no later than 8 p.m. Spend the rest of the evening talking with loved ones, meditating, having a relaxing bath or reading and go to bed no later than 10 p.m. That way, you can truly maximize the value of your 5 a.m. time. Sleeping isn’t the only important way to rejuvenate yourself. In fact, a key to top performance over time is to oscillate between periods of passionate, focused work at the highest levels and periods of time for deep refueling through relaxation, recovery and fun. It’s a process that the billionaire calls the twin-cycle of elite performance. Growth happens not just in the performance phase, but also in the recovery phase. If you want to understand why, said the billionaire, talk to a farmer. He’ll tell you that there is always an intense period of tilling soil, planting crops and serious work. But after that, is the fallow season. The fallow season might look like a period of rest. It looks like nothing’s happening. But really, it’s the fallow season, in which the soil is resting and replenishing its nutrients, that predicts how well crops are really going to blossom. Some of us don’t like to embrace the rest part of the twin-cycle. The entrepreneur recognized this, saying that if he isn’t working, he feels guilty. But, as the billionaire replied, balance is important. So don’t just work. Embrace rest, relaxation and fun, safe in the knowledge that it’s a key part of elite performance. The key message in these blinks: The first hours of the day are where heroes are made. If you want to master your life, start by owning the mornings. Freedom from distraction at 5 a.m. will allow you to build your creativity, maximize your fitness and protect your serenity in an age of complexity.  Actionable advice: Set your alarm clock half an hour fast and trick yourself into getting up at 5 a.m.  Firstly, buy an alarm clock. Technology is distracting and should never be in the bedroom. Once you’ve got a nice old fashioned clock, set it half an hour fast. Set yourself an alarm for 5.30 a.m. That way, when you wake up the next morning, you’re tricking yourself into thinking you are getting up later. When the alarm goes off, jump out of bed immediately, before the weaker part of your character can come up with reasons to stay under the duvet. Got feedback?

Maybe one, maybe more! Most of us have used technology to try and get more done. For some, it may have worked. For most, the difference is negligible. The truth is, extraordinary productivity (accomplishment without burnout) cannot be the product of coding and electronics. Only the awesome power of the human brain can make us more productive. We need to break free from machines and start using what’s in our heads. These five blinks outline steps to unleash your extraordinary productivity. In these blinks you’ll find out: the four types of information; why urgency is not the same as importance; and why it’s more important to treat your body, rather than your smartphone, with love. Like most of us, you probably spend half your day at work checking email. Well, as you surely know, such distractions take a major toll on your productivity. To avoid distraction, organize your tasks using a time matrix, a productivity tool consisting of four quadrants, each accounting for a different portion of your time. Q1 includes important, urgent work. For example, this is the time you spend handling emergencies or last-minute requests. Q2 consists of time spent working on important tasks that aren’t urgent: that report for an important strategy meeting next week, for example. Q3 time is for work that’s urgent but not important; e.g., constantly checking your email. And finally, Q4 is the time you waste on pointless things, like playing games on your phone or checking Facebook. All in all, you should spend most of your time in Q2. After all, although you may feel productive when you’re in Q1 and Q3 – you’re handling urgent business! – that’s not actually the case. Because we too often mistake the urgent for the vital, rarely leading to top-notch work. (For proof, just consider the misspelled, hastily constructed emails you’ve surely sent out in your life.) On the other hand, we do our best work in Q2. It’s where we can focus and think, instead of simply reacting to whatever comes our way. So, in order to stay in this quadrant, use the Pause-Clarify-Decide method to determine rationally whether the task is important. For instance, before opening a new email, pause for a moment and think: Who is this email from? What’s the subject? Will this need immediate action? If the answer to the last question is “no,” go concentrate on something else instead. We’ve just learned that we should spend most of our time focusing on important work. But what is important work, exactly? Does it involve operational tasks? Or creative ones? Well, it depends. Because ultimately, most jobs involve more than just one single role or task. So, on different days, different roles will be more important. Ideally, you should focus on work that’s most vital on any given day. For instance, on some days you may need to focus on a client. And then on other days, your employees are the priority. To effectively juggle these disparate roles and get your work done, it helps to create a role title and role statement for each hat you wear. Let’s define those terms. A role title defines your current focus, and a role statement should lay out where you want to be. So let’s say that in addition to being a line manager and a fire safety steward, you are also a web developer. For the latter position, your role title might be, Professional Web Developer. Then, you’ll want to create a dynamic role statement such as, “I strive to be an excellent web developer by mastering two programming languages.” Set achievable goals to stay on track with your statement. In this case, your goal might be, “I will learn two programming languages in the next two months.” In two months, assess how productively you worked to meet your goals. Now that you’ve spent some time improving your decision management by clearly defining your roles, their titles and goals, let’s develop your attention-management skills. Imagine there’s a landslide blocking a main road and you’re asked to clear all the boulders and rocks. How would you go about doing that? Well, you could start by moving the largest boulder. Although that’s hard work, it’s also the fastest way to clear the road. On the other hand, you could start by moving the gravel and the small rocks. That’s easier, for sure, but it’ll take longer. In this scenario, the most productive option would be to concentrate on the big rocks first. However, as soon as you get tired, you may start shifting gravel instead. This is a good metaphor for the experience of working in Q2: even when we make plans to only focus on the most important tasks, we often get tired and turn to the smaller, less important ones. How can you avoid this productivity slide? Start by designing a plan you can stick to: a Master Task List where you can plan and track important work for the week ahead.  Either on paper or electronically, plan everything you need to do. For instance, schedule blocks of time to spend learning programming languages. And then, create space each day for the non-scheduled bits (the gravel) that come up, like “urgent” emails and calls. Ultimately, the Master Task List will allow you to get everything out of your head and onto paper (or a computer), where you can see things more clearly. This method also makes it easier to stick to your plans, because when you schedule a task with a date and time, it’s easier to feel that you have the time to get it done. But of course, you need time to manage the task list, too! So, make sure you schedule 30 minutes per week and 10 minutes per day for planning. Would you ever let a computer make big life decisions for you? Obviously not. After all, only you can truly know what’s important to you. But then, what can you actually do to streamline and optimize your decision-making process? Before we answer that question, let’s first discuss the four types of input that comprise any decision: These four inputs represent different types of information and it’s up to you to sort each one into the appropriate place, onto a calendar, to-do list or contact list. Then, it’s important to collate all these different lists in one place and link everything together. For example, you’ll want to connect your calendar – which includes a list of your upcoming meetings as well as related notes – with your contact list, so you can quickly reach fellow attendees. Once you’ve figured out how to manage this information, you can start looking for appropriate technological tools to aid your organizational process.  For instance, you can set up an email filter to automatically route messages. After all, the average office worker receives 121 emails a day, a lot of which is time-wasting spam. In other words, let technology handle the most basic decisions for you, so you can concentrate on what’s important. We’ve already covered a lot of valuable productivity techniques, but there’s one crucial thing we haven’t covered yet: the most effective productivity system is useless if you aren’t taking care of yourself. Because, ultimately, a working and functioning body is vital to productivity. And the best way to look after yourself – and especially your brain – is through energy management. Although your brain only takes up two percent of your body mass, it consumes 20 percent of your energy. Thus, you need to make sure you have enough energy to feed your brain! But, unfortunately, modern life can be draining in this respect. Most of us work too much, sleep too little, eat poorly and stress out constantly. In short, we fail to manage our energy levels. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. In order to turn things around, we need to understand that energy comes from three sources. The first source of energy is powerful purpose. This refers to the intrinsic motivation you get from doing productive work. This can come from doing something rewarding (like charity work) or from the satisfaction of a job well done. But although you can mine this source if you have a job you value and enjoy doing, that alone is not enough. You also have to draw energy from your physical body. We weren’t designed to sit around all day; our bodies require movement to keep energy levels up. Finally, connections are the third important energy source. Although you might not realize it, energy largely depends on the health of our social connections (in other words, relationships and friendships). Thus, it’s crucial that you take the time to develop and maintain strong connections with other people. The key message: As long as you’re willing to change, you can become more productive. It’s not about working longer or harder, but rather about working better and concentrating on what’s important. And also, it’s a matter of taking care of your body and mind, so you have the energy to be productive.  Actionable advice: If you’re feeling overwhelmed by email, take an hour to organize your inbox. Archive the older messages and sort the rest. Then set up some automatic filters to handle the sorting for you in the future. That way, you won’t become overwhelmed again. Make sure you exercise and eat well, even when you’re busy.  It’s tempting to let your exercise routine slide when you’ve got a lot going on. But that oversight will backfire. Extraordinarily productive people take care of themselves and create time for daily wellness. What to read next: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, by Stephen R.

These blinks present a technique that will help you take action when you need to. In these blinks, you’ll also find out How five-second decisions had an impact on the civil rights movement; what percentage of employees are waiting to talk to their bosses about needed change; and how the five-second rule can help you stop worrying. It was six in the morning on a dark winter’s day in Boston when the author was rudely awakened by the sound of her alarm clock. There were days when Mel Robbins greeted the morning with a smile, but this was not one of them. She was unemployed, burdened with money troubles and had a drinking problem. She’d also developed the habit of hitting the snooze button and delaying the day ahead for as long as possible. But this particular morning was different; instead of the snooze button, Robbins began her day by counting down from five. This is called the five-second rule, and it’s used to prevent acting on detrimental urges. So instead of rolling over and sleeping on, Robbins counted silently to herself, “five, four, three, two, one.” This simple act distracts you from your anxieties and redirects your attention to what you should be doing, instead of submitting to instantly gratifying urges. By continually doing this, you can break a negative cycle and create new and better habits. Robbins also used the five-second rule to stop avoiding exercise and to push herself outdoors for regular jogs. And when she felt like procrastinating on updating her résumé, it was, “five, four, three, two, one” ...and she got to work. This tool is especially useful if you’re the kind of person who sits around waiting for inspiration to strike. In 1954, psychologist Julian Rotter coined a concept known as the locus of control. It explains the feeling people perceive of outside forces controlling their lives, and that those who feel more in control tend to be more productive. We’re often told to keep an eye out for opportunities and to take them when they appear. But the better advice is to assert control over your own destiny and create opportunities yourself. Robbins calls this the power of the push and the five-second rule might just be the push you need. On a cold December night, in 1955, Rosa Parks was sitting on a city bus and refused to stand up and give her seat to a white man. This relatively small act of defiance was nevertheless a historic moment of great courage in the fight for civil rights; and it shows us that it doesn’t necessarily take grand gestures to spark significant change. This is the same kind of philosophy that makes the five-second rule effective. Counting backward from five isn’t a dramatic lifestyle change, but it can push you toward being a more courageous person. The actions of Rosa Parks led to another small decision that would change the course of history. Four days after Parks was arrested, people began to organize a boycott of segregated buses, and they wanted a 26-year-old preacher to be the voice of their protest. This preacher would later write: “It happened so quickly that I did not have time to think it through. It is probable that if I had, I would have declined the nomination.” That preacher’s name was Martin Luther King, Jr. Parks and King didn’t consider themselves courageous people in their everyday lives, so their instincts weren’t to fight against injustice. Yet that’s what they did. They both encountered a moment when their instincts collided with their beliefs and goals and they felt the power of the push. Most of us have instincts that tell us to play it safe and not be courageous. But the five-second rule can give us just enough time to move in the direction that can open us up to life’s opportunities. Each day presents a chance to move toward greatness or stick with a safe and mundane routine. If you want to live an exceptional life, you’ll have to make the choice of taking five seconds to push yourself out of your comfort zone. There’s no reason to see the great people throughout history as any different than yourself. Rosa Parks was a shy and introverted woman and Dr. King struggled with self-doubt. They just pushed past these fears, and you can, too. If you want to change the perception your coworkers have of you, all you need to do is raise your hand during a meeting and speak your mind. If you want to add some joy to someone’s day, all you have to do is take a moment to compliment them. All these acts require is for you to make a decision, which is something you can always put off by telling yourself that today isn’t the right day. Eventually, this can be your life’s story, forever waiting for the right moment to arrive. So why not let this very moment be the one you’re waiting for? Let the five-second rule be the tool that allows you to make the choices you’ve always wanted to make. No one dreams of being a person who didn’t do anything. But we tend to wait “for the right time” even though our perfect scenario may never arrive. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of professional service employees are keeping feedback from their managers because it isn’t the “right time.” Even the most talented among us need a push to get on the right track. Steve Wozniak, cofounder of Apple, was plagued with uncertainty after he and Steve Jobs were offered funding to start their own business in 1977. Wozniak wanted to hold off for a while and worried about quitting his day job until his friends convinced him to take the leap. Wozniak certainly reaped the rewards the world has to offer to those who stop playing the waiting game. The author E.L. James didn’t wait for a lucrative publishing deal before writing the overwhelmingly popular Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. She was a working mother with a passion, and she created her own opportunity by self-publishing the book that she’d managed to write in her free time. Fifty Shades of Grey went on to sell a million copies in just four days, but it never would’ve happened if she hadn’t taken the initiative. To many people, professional athletes are extremely inspirational. As they should be; athletes show us what’s possible when you put your mind and body through rigorous training and practice. Some pro athletes seem practically inhuman, but their ability to push past most people’s physical limits is determined by one simple trait. Despite feeling too exhausted to continue, an athlete has the ability to separate from this feeling and continue to run or swim or cycle. Athletes know that feelings are only suggestions and sometimes it’s best to ignore those suggestions, especially when you’re trying to reach a goal. This is a good lesson to take to heart, since most of us base our decisions on feelings rather than goal-oriented logic. According to neuroscientist Antonio Damasio our emotions are the deciding factor for 95 percent of our decisions. So rather than “thinking and acting,” we generally “feel and act.” Part of Damasio’s research involved brain-damaged people who were unable to experience emotions. Even though they could list the pros and cons of any given choice, they were unable to make decisions. Damasio’s work led him to believe that human beings aren’t “thinking machines that feel,” but rather “feeling machines that think.” Armed with this understanding of how much dominion your emotions have over your choices, you can put the five-second rule to work. Instead of letting fears and worries stop you from fulfilling your dreams in life, catch yourself and take five seconds to make the decision that brings you closer to your goal. This is what’s known as psychological intervention, which dates back to Aristotle, who summed it up as: “Do good, be good.” In other words, you have to change your behavior before you can change how you feel about yourself. The five-second rule is such a useful tool because it’s focused on doing just that. It changes your behavior and provides you with the courage to overcome the psychological obstacles that stand in your way. There’s an irony to modern technology like smartphones and tablets. They were designed to make us more productive, yet they often end up distracting us, and they’ve exponentially increased our ability to procrastinate. But there’s a difference between innocent procrastination and destructive procrastination. When we avoid getting things done, even when we know that serious trouble will follow, it’s destructive procrastination. Experts used to think of all procrastination as being the result of bad time management and a lack of willpower or proper self-discipline. But it’s now understood that procrastination isn’t just laziness, but also a side effect of how we deal with stress. According to Timothy Pychyl, a psychology professor at Carleton University, procrastination is a result of our powerful subconscious desire for instant gratification. Since procrastination offers an immediate, albeit temporary, relief from the stress of life, we’re constantly drawn to it. The stress we long to escape from isn’t limited to meeting a deadline, either. Most of us face money or relationship issues that hover over us – it’s just a fact of life. So putting life on pause to shop for a new pair of shoes is just a way of easing the pressure, just for a little bit. To overcome the temptation of procrastination, use the five-second rule. Let it be your new, healthier habit. Since the best way to complete a task is to “just get started,” as Dr. Pychyl puts it, you’ll want to start the five-second rule the moment you start to sense the urge to procrastinate or do something else. Once you begin to use it for this purpose, you’ll immediately begin improving your locus of control. After all, procrastination is just another way of giving up control. So, instead, start the countdown and reassert control over your life. There’s no big mystery to why we’re all so prone to worrying. As children, most of us were constantly being taught to worry by over-concerned parents telling us to “be careful” and “put a coat on or you’ll catch a cold.” As a result, we’ve become adults who spend far too much time worrying about things that are beyond our control. And the fact is, we’ll likely come to regret all this time spent sweating the small stuff. Dr. Karl Pillemer is a Cornell University professor who has spent over ten years discussing the meaning of life with more than 1,200 senior citizens. Through these conversations, one thing has become clear: most senior citizens believe they’ve wasted too much time worrying. Life is far too precious a thing to spend living in fear and anxiety, so before you regret another minute, use the five-second rule to take control and live life to its fullest. Pay attention to your mood, and when you feel your mind begin to give itself over to worry, take five seconds to peacefully count down from five so you can reassert control. As soon as you reach “one,” ask yourself these two questions: “What am I grateful for in this moment?” and “What do I want to remember?” Answering these questions will help you shift your focus away from the worry and onto the more uplifting and positive aspects of life. Remember, there are truly important and precious parts of life, such as your relationships and the things you are working on, so use the five-second rule to remind yourself of the big picture. In any given moment, there are bound to be more things to be grateful for than to be anxious about. The key message in these blinks: Nothing is set in stone. Your habits, mind-set and personality traits are flexible and subject to change. Once you realize this, your life can start changing for the better. To help facilitate this change, use the five-second rule, a simple tool that can help you adjust your “default” reactions by counting down from five. By changing the way we make decisions, this relatively small act can add up to redefine who you are, how you feel and what you do with your life.  Actionable advice: Reframe your anxiety as excitement. Next time you’re feeling nervous about something, such as a job interview or speaking publicly, don’t tell yourself to “calm down.” Instead, say, “I’m excited!” Anxiety is a state of physiological arousal and you can flip it around to make it positive instead of letting the fear pull you in. When you tell yourself that you’re excited, it provides a valid positive alternative that allows you to stay in control. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Moran and Michael Lennington","summary":"As Thomas Edison once said, “If we did the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves.” This may be true, but why is it that so many of us fall somewhat short, not only of astounding ourselves, but of astounding anyone at all? Why is it that the overwhelming majority of human beings never live up to their full potential? And what would your life look like if you performed at your very best, every single day? Well, the only way to find out is to try – and that’s what these blinks are designed to help you do. They’ll explain how abandoning an annual cycle and adopting a 12-week cycle can transform your productivity and success. By planning and thinking in 12-week segments, you’ll begin performing better and achieving more – all in less time. Over the course of these blinks, you’ll learn how to develop a vision and make a plan, as well as how to keep yourself on track with systems and measure your progress. In these blinks, you’ll learn why annual planning breeds complacency; what Mike Tyson can teach us about delivering on our goals; and why planning is so important. We’re all familiar with the aphorism “knowledge is power.” But this kernel of wisdom is a bit misleading – because, in and of itself, knowledge bestows no particular power on its possessor. Rather, the power comes from what one does with one’s knowledge. In short, ideas are only powerful if they’re acted on. Let’s look at a few examples. Roughly 65 percent of Americans are either overweight or obese. But that’s not for lack of knowledge. There are around 46,000 diet books available, and the diet and fitness industry is worth $60 billion a year. Everyone knows deep down that they need to eat a little better and move a little more. They just don’t act on that knowledge. The same is true in business. Sure, you need a great idea to succeed. But execution is what makes the difference: ideas are only rewarded if they’re deftly executed in the market. Apple is a success because they took a series of great ideas and executed them with incredible skill. Achieving your true potential isn’t about dreaming big; it’s about executing ably. Evidence shows that the consistent application of best practice will improve results significantly. Take Ann Laufman, a financial advisor from Houston. Laufman had a sense that she could be doing better, but was at a bit of a loss as to how to move forward. Laufman began using the 12 Week Year approach which focuses on executing tasks more effectively. Instead of taking a new approach – focusing on wealthier clients, for instance, or widening her potential market – she simply applied her existing approach more effectively. She soon found that focusing on execution worked wonders. Eventually, Laufman increased her output by 400 percent, and became the first woman in her firm’s history to be awarded “associate of the year.’” The 12 Week Year approach can help you execute better, too – that is, to focus on what’s important, manage your time better, measure your results and achieve more, faster. Most of us think annually. We set New Year’s resolutions; we celebrate anniversaries; our businesses have annual reports and yearly targets. We tend to judge our achievements on an annual basis. But what if annualized thinking is a trap? Annual planning processes aren’t only counterproductive and hard to plan for; they also breed complacency. During the first week of January, December looks and feels a long way off. In the first months of the year, it’s easy to think, “OK, well, I’m not quite on track to hit my targets. But there is plenty of time to catch up.” But if you don’t feel any urgency, you’re unlikely to act with urgency. It’s common in business to have an end-of-year push to meet targets – so it’s no wonder that, in many financial-services firms, December is the year’s best month, with the fourth quarter of the fiscal year accounting for between 30 and 40 percent of sales. Businesses whose tax year ends in June experience the same effect that month: the impending deadline focuses their minds and increases performance. Top performers recognize that shorter planning periods bring greater urgency and focus. High performing athletes were some of the first to embrace periodization, a technique that isolates one skill that needs developing, and then perfects it in a short period of time before moving on to the next skill. But the same approach works for business, or for any goals in life. Consider the impact of a 12-week planning cycle. Remember that end-of-the-year surge in performance and productivity? Well, now you get that all the time. A 12-week period is long enough to enable you to achieve something meaningful, while sufficiently short that you can’t be complacent about your deadline. With a 12-month year, you can afford a few lazy weeks. But with a 12-week year? You need to make every day count. Think of humanity’s greatest achievements: the printing press, the internet, modern medicine, space travel, smartphones. Each of these creations began as a vision – a vague and fantastic dream that people and organizations thought up and then worked hard to make happen. Vision inspires action, progress and results. Sal Durso, a client of the authors’, explained how, not long ago, his company suffered a crisis. A handful of key personnel left, taking clients and revenue with them, an occurrence that shook him both personally and professionally. So Durso took some time off work, and, while in Alaska, he found inspiration in a meadow of fireweed flowers that had grown from the ashes of a forest fire. It occurred to him that, instead of dwelling on his smoldering business losses, he should focus on rebirth. Back in the office, he worked tirelessly to recraft a new vision for the company – sowing seeds among the ashes and creating his own fireweed meadow. A year later, his board, advisors and employees all agreed that the company was much improved, bound together by a newfound common vision. Durso embraced the power of vision – a clear, positive view of what can be achieved – to kick-start progress. Whether you need rebirth, or are doing fine but could be doing better, a clear vision is a surefire way to move forward. So how do you go about developing one? Well, your vision should be ambitious but realistic, and should take into account two time frames. First, take a step back from the daily grind and consider your long-term dreams, both personal and professional. Take a pen and paper and write down what you think will matter to you in ten years’ time. How much money do you want in the bank? How much time with your kids? Where do you want your business to be? Write this all down, and build from it a vision of your life ten years down the road. Now let’s get a little more specific. Working toward that long-term view, what do you want to achieve in the next three years? Again, write down, in detail, what an ideal life looks like three years from today. This should give you a clear view of where you want to get to. In the next blink, we’ll look at how to take that ten- and three-year view, and start to break it down into achievable, 12-week years. It can be easy to think, “I know what I need to do – I don’t need to waste time writing out a silly plan.” But plans help us stay on track. Many people know they need to exercise more and eat less. But without a firm plan to take a pre-work jog and count every meal’s calories, they fail. Knowing isn’t a substitute for planning. A 12-week plan helps you proactively manage your time and focus on important actions. With no plan at all, your daily actions are driven by input triggers. An email arrives, you answer it. The doorbell rings, up you get. It’s hard to focus on high-impact activities – such as sales calls, or writing a proposal – because you’re not making proactive choices about your time. You’re simply responding to what’s right in front of you. So any plan will help keep you focused, but a 12 Week Year plan will do an especially good job. Annual plans are inherently hard to follow – no one knows exactly what their life will look like in six months – but doing day-to-day planning for the next 12 weeks is simple. So how can you create a 12-week plan? First, choose your goals. Let’s say the vision you came up with is to sell your business for millions of dollars. Well, a realistic, 12-week goal that’ll put you on the path to that vision might be to generate $110,000 in new business. Second, write specific, measurable tasks that, if completed, will lead to your goal. They could be “cold-call ten prospects per week,” or “create a sales-tracker wall chart and update it each week.” Try to focus on a small number of critical activities that you know will move you toward your goal, and don’t overthink it. As the general George Patton once said, “A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.” Now it’s time to learn some tricks to keep you executing your plan, even when the going gets tough. In the blunt words of boxer Mike Tyson, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” In business as in life, we all take a few hits from time to time. So how do you stay on course, especially when the going gets tough? Willpower and determination can take us a long way, but neither can take us all the way. Even athletic megastars like the Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps have days when they don’t feel like training. And yet they do train. Why? Because they have clear, daily schedules, as well as dedicated trainers to enforce them. Of course, we can’t all afford the rigorous support network available to Phelps, but we can embrace two simple support techniques: the weekly plan and the weekly accountability meeting. A weekly plan translates the 12-week plan into day-to-day actions. It should list all the tasks from your 12-week plan that are due that particular week – things like meetings with prospects or follow-up calls with promising clients. Each task should bring you closer to your goal, and listing them all, week by week, should make it easy to measure your progress. If you get these tasks done, you’ve had a great week. If not, you need to adjust something. If that clarity isn’t enough to keep you focused, try embracing the support of your peers. A 2005 article in Fast Company reported on patients who had severe heart disease and needed to make major lifestyle changes to avoid surgery and stay alive. After 12 months, and despite the risks, only 10 percent of the patients had successfully resisted their bad habits. Compare this dismal success rate with that of people who were involved in group support sessions moderated by a psychologist. Their success rate was 80 percent. In other words, being supported by others helps keep us on track with our goals. As the sports entrepreneur George Shinn once commented, “There is no such thing as a self-made man. You will reach your goals only with the help of others.” So try and set up a Weekly Accountability Meeting with one or two committed individuals. Use the meeting to report back on how successfully you’ve executed your intentions for the week, and to make observations on what’s working and what’s not. The simple knowledge that you’ll have to evaluate your performance in front of your peers will help keep you on track, and, if it doesn’t, they can provide advice and suggestion for improvement. Every CEO of a major corporation tracks key numbers: units sold, monthly profit margins and revenue. You should do the same. Measuring metrics and KPIs enables you to understand progress and make decisions about your future actions. So the question becomes, “What should you measure and how should you measure it?” To be effective, measurement systems should include lead and lag indicators. Let’s say your 12-week goal is to lose ten pounds. A lag indicator is an end result, so here it would be your weight-loss each week. Lead indicators are the actions that make that lag indicator happen. So here, they could be a mile run, calories consumed or minutes spent on the elliptical trainer. Measuring lead indicators is particularly important. The authors have found that if you execute 85 percent or more of the actions listed in your weekly plan, you are highly likely to achieve your 12-week goal. Remember that the actions in your plan are your most critical tasks: if you’re nailing them, you’re likely to succeed. Also, keep in mind that embracing measurement requires a shift in thinking. Numbers are impersonal, and make no allowances for the personal circumstances that could impact performance – like your son being sick, or your boss bringing you into an extra project. But, even though they might seem unfair, face up to what your numbers tell you. All too often, people stop scoring themselves after a couple of tough weeks. Use your weekly accountability meeting to keep you on track, and try to make realistic progress. If you are only completing 45 percent of your critical tasks one week, you probably won’t get up to 85 percent the next week; however, lifting that 45 percent up to 60 percent is still a solid, and manageable, achievement. An increasing score is a good sign for your future results. The 12 Week Year can be uncomfortable sometimes, particularly when it comes to your numbers, which won’t let you hide behind excuses. If your results don’t look great, you have two options. You can quit, or you can double down and improve your execution. And who wants to be a quitter? We’ve all been there. You know you need to write that winning proposal. But just as you get started, you notice that your emails are piling up, and you’ve got five new voicemails – oh, and there’s that invoice you keep meaning to deal with. So you take the time to tackle these urgent but unimportant tasks, figuring that the proposal can wait. But here’s the thing: deferring strategically important tasks to accomplish urgent but less important actions means you’ll never deliver to your potential. The difference between average results and brilliant ones often boils down to effective time management. But there’s a reason most of us don’t deliver utter brilliance: effectively managing time is hard. A 2005 study by Basex, a research firm, found that 28 percent of an average professional’s working day was spent on interruptions – phone calls, emails, chats with coworkers – and on recovering from those interruptions. That’s over ten hours every week. So how can you structure your time better and stay focused? Your week should include three kinds of protected time: strategic blocks, buffer blocks and breakout blocks.  A strategic block is a three-hour period during which you accept no interruptions – no phone calls, no emails, no quick chats with Janet in the next cubicle. You focus all of your attention on your key strategic activities, whether that means sales calls, writing proposals or closing deals. Buffer blocks are times set aside to efficiently deal with all interruptions in one go. For an hour, once or twice a day, you can blast through your emails, respond to your voicemails and catch up with Bob in accounts. Breakout blocks help keep us sane and productive. It’s easy to get sucked into working longer and longer hours, but it’s terrible for productivity. A three-hour breakout block, once a week, during normal working hours but spent away from your business, will help you stay fresh, focused and energetic. When you plan your week, schedule in these blocks. Then schedule in all your other key actions from your week plan. Your calendar will look pretty full – but that’s okay! The things you’ve scheduled are the critical tasks that’ll keep you moving toward your goals. When we’re struggling with something – a hectic period in the office, say, or an overwhelming amount of academic work – it’s easy to blame our circumstances. We say things like, “I’m just too busy with these projects to make my sales calls,” or, “I’ll quit the cigarettes when the stress of these exams is over.” But the reality is this: until we throw off a victim mind-set and take ownership of our actions, we stand no chance of improving our results. Take Dustin Carter. As a kid, his arms and legs were amputated to save his life from a severe blood infection. Now, it would have been easy, considering this horrendous setback, for Carter to sink into a stupor of self-pity. But he didn’t. Instead of casting himself as a victim, he learned to thrive, and made a decision that seemed a little crazy: he decided to pursue his dream of becoming a wrestler. And, through years of painful, hard training, he did become a success, wrestling able-bodied competitors and inspiring millions. Whatever your goals are, you’ll find yourself in situations that make it harder to reach them, be it a busy time at work, a family problem or health issues. But Dustin reminds us that, though you can’t control your circumstances, you can control how you react to them. This ability is what people call accountability – the willingness to accept what you can control and take ownership of it. By taking accountability for your own results, your focus will shift toward improving them. Really, failure is just a form of feedback. Once you accept that your poor sales figures are a result of your actions, you can quickly decide to change those actions, and see your sales figures change, too. In the words of Lou Cassara, a financial advisor and business expert, “If you want something you don’t currently have, you need to do something you’re not currently doing.” Society generally associates accountability with blame. If someone commits some blameworthy blunder, we hold them accountable. But real accountability isn’t about blame; it’s about accepting ownership for your actions and your outcomes. Embracing that shift in thinking is a major move toward more success. The key message in these blinks: The 12 Week Year is a system that should help you achieve your goals by helping you execute more effectively. It will help you speed up your execution cycle, cut out the slack in your annual plan and encourage you to measure and face up to reality. But it will only work if you really engage and commit to it, so get to work! Draft your vision, your goals and your 12-week plan today.  Actionable advice: Break down major tasks into more manageable chunks  When you have multiple big tasks ahead of you, it can feel overwhelming. But research shows that when you think a goal is manageable, you are more likely to achieve it. So if the key actions in your 12-week plan look a little intimidating, work on breaking them down. Write out the individual steps involved in writing a proposal or securing a new business deal. The kick you’ll get out of chalking up executed tasks and making visible progress will be a great motivator! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

No matter your calling in life, there’s a good chance you’ll hit a rough patch where things aren’t going as planned and progress is at a frustrating standstill. Many of us have watched as colleagues get promoted ahead of us, sales figures plateau, relationships grow cold or felt like our work is getting worse rather than better. In the words of author Seth Godin, this difficult time is known as the Dip, and it can be found in just about every facet of life. But don’t despair! Even though the Dip is virtually unavoidable, there is often light at the end of the tunnel. Those who show patience and determination will be rewarded when growing pains come to an end and promotions, customers and relationships take a turn for the better. As Godin points out, the Dip is just a natural progression for any endeavor and by being prepared for it, you’ll be better suited to succeed. In these blinks you’ll find out how the Dip can be used as a helpful tool; how the Dip has benefitted giants like Microsoft; and why you should stop worrying and learn to love the Dip. Let’s say you want to master figure skating. Learning how to gracefully glide across the ice, and even skate backward, can happen pretty quickly. But learning how to land a perfect quadruple jump will take a great deal of time and strenuous effort before you can perfect it. This is the time when you’re struggling – deep in the Dip. The same experience can happen when you’re bringing a new business to life. At first it’ll be smooth sailing as you fall in love with your exciting and innovative ideas. But then there’s the inevitable mountains of paperwork to overcome and figuring out how to solve the many problems that will arise during the early stages. Chances are, it’ll be years before the Dip is over and you’re comfortably running a successful business. Sometimes the Dip can be purposefully built-in to a process as a way of finding out who the most dedicated and hardworking people are. Imagine you’re a student in the US, thinking of going to medical school. One of your mandatory classes in the first year will be Organic Chemistry – a fiendishly difficult subject that will eat up a great deal of your study time. While Organic Chemistry isn’t the most important class in the curriculum, it creates a Dip that causes many students to throw in the towel early on. A lot of people entertain the idea of becoming a doctor, so creating a Dip early on is an easy way for universities to reduce the class size to only the most dedicated students. A similar strategy is used in the hiring processes of companies around the world. In order to whittle down the applicant pool to only the best talents, many job applications require an excessive amount of documentation and include multiple rounds of stressful interviews. The good news is, by recognizing these Dips for what they are, you can find comfort in the knowledge that they’re supposed to be difficult and that it will get easier if you just stick with it. When you were growing up, there’s a very good chance you were taught to have modest, realistic goals rather than bold, grand ambitions. The truth is that if you aim for being the best at what you do, the rewards can be phenomenal. Take ice-cream flavors, for example: coming in at number one is vanilla, which accounts for 30 percent of all ice cream sales in the US. Meanwhile, chocolate comes in at second, but only accounts for 10 percent of the sales. That’s a huge difference between the best and second-best – and this phenomenon applies to more than just snack foods. According to Zipf’s law, a significant gap between first and second place can be found everywhere, from record sales to the top colleges. Naturally, Zipf’s law also means that being number one comes with huge profits, but there are also less obvious perks to being the very best at what you do. One such advantage is the word-of-mouth boost known as the snowball effect. Imagine being in a foreign city and wanting to find a decent place to eat. If you ask a local, you’ll likely get pointed toward whatever restaurant is the number one local favorite. So, if you’re the owner of that establishment, you’re all but guaranteed to have those hungry travelers regularly showing up thanks to all that free word-of-mouth promotion. Another perk is related to how much you can charge. Since being the best is such a rarefied thing that sets you far apart from anyone else, you’re free to charge more for your premium product or service. This applies to just about everything, whether it’s about popular actors, musicians, hotels, restaurants, food brands or manufacturers – it pays to be the best. The average grade school experience is about getting an all-around general education, with rewards tending to go to the students who get good marks in every subject. But in the post-school world, being good at everything isn’t as important as being at the top of your class in one important subject. In other words, success is about specializing in something. Specificity has many advantages. For starters, some people aren’t sure about what career to pursue. But if you’re lucky enough to already have a specific skill that you excel at, this can make career decisions much easier. Even if you’ve already begun a career, you should know that customers aren’t interested in average – they want exceptional, and providing world-class service is just another form of specialization. If you’re an accountant, your customers aren’t going to care if you’re an amazing golfer or a virtuoso at playing the guitar. The only thing that matters is that you’re the best accountant they can get. An important part of specializing is learning how to strategically quit the things that get in the way of you being the best at what you do. However, most people have been taught that quitting is wrong, and that they should stick with any project they’ve started and never give up. Unfortunately, people can’t be truly exceptional and the best at a wide range of things. Instead, people need to make distinct choices, which means quitting intensive pursuits that aren’t related to your central focus. For example, let’s say you have a passion to produce the world’s first flying car, but you also want to play trumpet in an innovative jazz band and start a non-profit that promotes the use of eco-friendly green energy. All of your interests may be worthwhile, but it just isn’t feasible to do it all and be the best at everything. The better strategy is to make the clear choice of focusing on the one project that you’ve got the skills for and feel most passionate about. But as we’ll find out in the next blink, even if you’ve chosen wisely, you can still end up in the Dip. Fortunately, you can have the advantage of knowing exactly what to expect. As the saying goes, “knowing is half the battle.” And knowing that a Dip is on the way is an important insight that gives you time to plan ahead and to familiarize yourself with what your particular Dip will look like. Since every type of business has its own Dip, let’s take a look at some of the most common ones, starting with manufacturing. If you have a passion for manufacturing, you may have already enjoyed the thrill of building something in your garage. But if you’re hoping to take things to the next level, it’s going to require substantial investments in technology and tools. You may also need to invest in learning new skills, like how to create an integrated electric circuit. So, in this case, the Dip is going to be the amount of time, effort and money it takes to transition from the garage to a professional production operation. It will involve the lengthy and unpleasant business of raising funds, finding partners, creating a production line and securing your first clients. And during each step of this slow and frustrating process, it will be tempting to call it quits, so it’s important to remember that the Dip will end as long as you persevere. If your business is in sales, you’ll find that coming up with a good idea and getting investors on board might be the easy part. The Dip happens afterward, when you’re trying to expand your business and build an effective sales force. This is when the dreary business of recruiting and onboarding new employees begins, since it requires the tedious work of setting up everyday operational structures and ensuring legal compliance. It’s also worth knowing when the Dip arrives in personal projects too. Let’s say you want to learn Chinese. At first you’ll be intrigued by the unusual characters and their meanings and fascinated by the new sounds as they take on new meanings for you. But it won’t take long before these initial pleasures give way to the Dip, which will take months or years of hard work to overcome and get to the point where you’re speaking the language fluently. And then there’s the dreaded relationship Dip. It follows the honeymoon period, and is characterized by the new couple engaging in everyday squabbles as they try to cement their relationship and commitment while fighting off boredom. If it wasn’t for the unpredictable nature of the wind, windsurfing would probably be pretty easy. In fact, many people are drawn to windsurfing and experience an initial thrill, but then end up cursing the wind and giving up what at first seems like a fun hobby. But despite the difficulties it may occasionally bring, you obviously can’t windsurf without wind! In fact, the wind is the best part, which brings us to the key in withstanding the Dip: embracing the challenge. Ultimately, whatever your project is, the sensible thing to do is to welcome the challenges it presents and be thankful for them rather than trying to resist them. Indeed, finding ways to overcome challenges is what makes an activity stimulating and rewarding. Think about it: if windsurfing was so easy that anyone could do it, it would probably be boring. The point of taking on any job is to meet and overcome challenges. For example, if you were to work at a retail store and only ring up the items being purchased, there would be little challenge and you would be easily replaceable. But if you also help the customers, especially the really difficult ones, and take care of their needs, you will show that you’ve got skills that are less easy to replace. Taking on challenges is the very essence of growth and development. So if you really push yourself to your limits, you will not only survive, but thrive in the Dip. Take exercise, for instance. If you wish to have a good physique, it will take entering the Dip purposefully and pushing yourself to the limits. However, many people will stop too early; they’ll reach a certain comfort level and not press any further. If you hope to truly develop muscle, you’ll have to push to the point of exhaustion. Only those who push beyond their limits each and every time will be able to achieve a bodybuilder’s physique. The same is true of any endeavor, whether it’s mental or physical. Competition is rarely a pleasant business. Dealings with competitors can be full of treachery and resentment. Often, one of the primary motivations of a competitor is to lengthen your time in the Dip. Specifically, an established competitor will create a marketplace that makes it very hard for you to gain a foothold. The tech giant Microsoft, for example, turned programs like Word and Excel into industry standards. As a result, the market for word processing and spreadsheet software has been virtually impregnable. Given how extremely hard it is for a rival to catch up, they’ve effectively put any potential competitor into a prolonged Dip. Nevertheless, it isn’t impossible. A company called Intuit released the accounting software Quicken and since it was an innovative product comparable to Microsoft’s, they were able to persevere, highlighting the quality and security their program offered. Competitors have also succeeded in changing the platform on which the services are offered. In order to successfully compete with Microsoft, Google has focused on web-based word processing and spreadsheet services that are built-in to a customer’s Google account. Another benefit of sticking with it and challenging yourself to get through the Dip is that it will keep you from settling for mediocrity. While there’s nothing wrong with settling for a job as a cashier in a quaint suburban shop, there’s a good chance this won’t help you to reach your full potential. On the other hand, persevering through the Dip can bring out the best in you and even make you more talented than when you started. For example, if your new online photography blog doesn’t catch on right away, you can use this Dip time to sharpen your writing, photography and web design skills and make your online destination more attractive. This way, even if your blog never catches on as you’d hoped, you’ll have gained valuable skills that can be put to use on your next online project. If you’ve ever been stuck in a long line at the supermarket, you know how tempting it can be to switch to another checkout lane in the hopes of getting out a little bit quicker. But there’s always a chance that once you switch to the other line, that first one will start to speed up and you’ll end up waiting longer than you would have in the first place! This supermarket scenario can be applied to careers and personal projects too. If something seems to be slowing down or stalled, you may be tempted to move everything over to a new endeavor – but what’s really needed is patience and grit, otherwise known as determination. This is certainly true for sales: In one influential study, researchers found that if a salesperson can’t convince a customer to buy after five sales pitches, they’ll give up on them. However, the study also showed that 80 percent of customers were more likely to make a purchase after hearing seven sales pitches. Therefore, most of the salespeople were calling it quits too early. If they’d just shown a bit more grit and patience they might have sealed the deal. Patience and determination is also needed for surviving the Dip time before your product catches on. You may think that we’re living in a time where people are quick to buy whatever the latest innovative product is, but that’s not always the case. Even if you have a clever idea or a game-changing product, the general public always wait for new things to be regarded as high quality, reliable or prestigious before they even consider parting with their hard-earned money. As a result, even ingenious ideas can spend a long time in the Dip before they become popular. A good example is the shoemaker Jimmy Choo. Born in 1948, Choo had been making quality shoes since he was 11 years old. But his career didn’t take off until he was in his late thirties, a couple of years after he moved from Malaysia to London and opened his first American shoe store in 1986. While he was always a talented craftsman, it was his grit and perseverance through the Dip that really allowed him to become an iconic international fashion brand. While it’s undoubtedly beneficial to have grit, it’s nevertheless wise to know when to cut your losses and quit a project that’s clearly falling apart. But there’s also a smart way to both quit and simultaneously stick with your chosen field. When something is clearly not working, there’s no sense in letting it continue to drain your time, energy and resources. But that doesn’t mean you should quit the market that you’ve grown familiar with and gained experience within. Doing so would just be yet another waste of your time, energy and resources. Let’s say you’ve decided to shut down a magazine that was no longer financially feasible. You may be so heartbroken over the magazine’s demise that you want to abandon the publishing world altogether and start a restaurant. But the smart plan would be to stay in the media market and use the experience you’ve gained to become an editor for someone else’s magazine or newspaper, or perhaps start an online publication. The next time you feel like quitting, make sure you consider all your options before throwing in the towel. It’s best to take the time to think creatively – beyond all the obvious choices. David is a friend of the author, and at one point he was so unhappy at work he felt like quitting. The problem was that his boss was so incompetent that he was making it impossible for David to produce good work and feel satisfied about his job. David’s frustrations finally reached the point where he wanted to hand in his resignation. But instead of overreacting, he wisely took the time to consider all the other options at his disposal. In the end, he had productive conversations with his boss as well as his boss’s superior. David was candid in explaining the reasons why he felt unable to contribute his best work under the current circumstances. As a result, David was transferred to another department where he was given a new boss and a promotion! Certainly, this was a better outcome than being unemployed. So remember, when you find yourself in the Dip, don’t doubt yourself and your commitment or abilities. Instead, lean into it and think of it as your friend, not your enemy. In the end, you’ll find yourself stronger and in a better position for having risen to the occasion. The key message in these blinks: In life, you should strive to be the best at what you do. And to make this happen, it’s important to focus your time and energy on the one thing that you’re skilled and passionate about, and to let go of projects that are competing for your interests. Once you get going with a project, you will eventually face a Dip – a period of struggle, effort and little reward. To make it through this period, you must use grit and patience. Once you make it through the Dip, you’ll find that your skills have improved and that you are now in a better position than many of your competitors. Therefore, the Dip is the path to success. Actionable advice: Keep going, especially when it hurts. We’re most inclined to give up during the moments when we feel hurt and discouraged. For example, in 1988 the Democrat Joe Biden was a promising candidate for the U.S. presidency. But then a scandal erupted around a trivial accident involving a quote in one of Biden’s speeches that had been mistakenly attributed to the wrong person. Biden was so discouraged by the overblown reaction that he withdrew his candidacy. However, if he’d persevered and allowed the minor scandal to blow over, he could very well have won. So think twice about retreating when you’re feeling wounded and vulnerable. It’s probably best to take a moment to lick your wounds and then forge ahead. Got feedback?

Rosen","summary":"What’s the first thing you do when you need to find the solution to a problem or find some information? Most likely, you reach for your smartphone. With a world of information constantly at the ready in your pocket, there’s hardly any information you can’t find within seconds. And do you even remember what it was like trying to keep up contact with all your friends before Facebook? Let’s make no mistake. There are definite pluses to living in an interconnected high-tech world. But there are downsides too. Our brains are the product of millions of years’ worth of evolution. They have developed to operate in a certain way. Unfortunately, we’re hard-wired to get distracted, and new technology is hardly helping. These blinks explain just how the brain works and what strategies can be deployed so that you don’t use your smartphone unless you have to. Don’t worry; this isn’t a guide to returning to the Stone Age! It’s a pointer to enjoying life and getting the most out of it. Along the way, you’ll learn how your brain responds when you see a terrifying lion; how often people reach for their smartphones each day; and what to do to change your brain for the better. The human brain is unquestionably one of the wonders of the universe. With it, we can achieve incredible feats – from solving complicated math problems to learning languages and designing cars and jets. In short, it’s one of the most complex systems in the known universe. In fact, it’s this complexity that helps us set goals and perform an incalculable number of tasks. From gossiping with friends to presenting the next big project for colleagues at work, our brain is equipped with decision-making, planning and evaluation abilities. More formally, these are known as executive functions. After this planning function, another faculty of the brain is necessary to actually accomplish tasks. Specifically, we need cognitive control. These are cognitive abilities like attention, goal management and working memory. If we didn’t have cognitive control, there’d be no way to make conscious decisions that inform and have an impact upon our lives. Instead, we’d just respond unthinkingly and mechanically to the world around us. Imagine you’re wandering the aisles of your local supermarket because you need food and drinks for friends who are coming over that night. If you were to suddenly lose all cognitive control, your ability to pay attention to and remember that goal would simply vanish. Instead of tracking down beer and snacks, you’d be walking through the aisles without aim. Unfortunately, nowadays, our cognitive control is under more stress and strain than ever before. Consequently, we are distracted from our goals even more. This has a lot to do with complexity and the complicated nature of the brain in particular. More complex systems are more vulnerable to interference. If we’d evolved so that we could cognitively control our minds despite constant interference, that would be great. But we haven’t. In fact, our cognitive control seems to have evolved less than our executive functions. In other words, we’re collectively great at setting goals but far worse at seeing them through. This explains why we all tend to forget tasks like calling on a friend’s birthday or turning off the lights. We might like to imagine that we’re in full control of our behavior, but that’s far from the case. We can’t help the way environmental stimuli cause us to respond automatically. These external stimuli are called bottom-up influences. Typically, they’re characterized by saliency, which means they are immediately noticeable to us, like, for example, when you hear someone shouting your name. Additionally, these stimuli have novelty – a dramatic and unexpected quality such as a car backfiring. There’s nothing we can do to stop our involuntary responses to bottom-up influences. And for good reason. They are the mark of the survival instinct we’ve inherited from our ancestors. Thankfully, we are more than just passive creatures, primed only to respond to sudden stimuli for immediate survival. In general, our actions are guided by the perception-action cycle: we perceive the world in a certain way and act accordingly. We have also evolved the ability to pause in the moment and evaluate our perception of a given situation. That means we can decide upon the best response at the time. These internal decision-making mechanisms are called top-down influences. Let’s look at an example. Imagine a baby pinches your arm. You pull away quickly in pain, but you aren’t going to hit back blindly in response, as you’re aware you’re in no danger. No action is taken because of the “pause” in the cycle when you evaluate and act upon possible responses. Now that we’ve glanced into the brain's workings, let’s try to understand why it’s so difficult for us to achieve self-imposed goals. Although we can’t hold buzzing smartphones or flashing TV screens entirely responsible for distracting us, it’s nonetheless clear that modern technology has put considerable strain on our cognitive control. More precisely, modern technologies exploit our brain’s intrinsic susceptibility to interference. They impede our performance and sidetrack us from our goals. You know the feeling: even though you’re in an important meeting you just can’t help glancing at your phone. Or maybe you totally zone out at the dinner table because the game is playing on the TV next door, and you can hear the crowd reaching fever pitch. The obvious solution might be to keep clear of cafés, TVs and the internet when you’ve got an objective you want to achieve. But it’s not that simple. The truth is, we let ourselves be distracted because these interferences are a basic facet of what it is to be human. Our primitive primate brains were always on the lookout for food, as that’s what we needed to survive. Nowadays, this instinct remains, but it expresses itself as a search for information as well as food. Consequently, we get the same hit of satisfaction from activities like googling, Twitter browsing, or TV watching as we did when we were primates foraging for food. Amazingly, even when this behavior hampers performance and interferes with our goals, we let it continue. It’s actually just part of being human and, interestingly, it’s a drive that’s linked to our internal reward systems. For instance, a 2009 study of macaque monkeys showed that when primates receive information, their dopamine systems are activated just as they are when food is found. That may explain why we end up juggling smartphones, TVs and tablets. We crave that hit of dopamine. We’ve seen that we have hardwired responses to information. But this means we have to recognize how the current high-tech world makes it all the more easy for us to get distracted. Specifically, there are three technologies which deliberately accentuate interference and have significantly changed societal behavior. These are the internet, smartphones and social media. First off, the internet provides us with an endless supply of ready information at all times. It’s also thanks to the internet that we have email, a form of free and instant communication. Mobile computing has meant that the internet is now everywhere too. This is most visible in the omnipresence of smartphones. A single device that can browse the web, stream video and music, take pictures and share them can now be carried everywhere. This probably explains why 860 million Europeans and 7 in 10 people in the United States have a smartphone. And these objects are put through their paces too. On average a smartphone is picked up 27 times a day. And that’s just the average: some people pick them up as many as 150 times a day! These three technologies make it extremely difficult to focus on one task at a time or to sustain focus over a long period. We might like to tell ourselves that we’re “multitasking,” but in reality, we’re just jumping between different tasks without giving sufficient attention to any. A 2013 study conducted by one of the authors showed just this. Students could only keep their attention on one task for three to five minutes at a time before they directed their focus elsewhere. This occurs in non-work environments too. The next time you’re at a café, look at all the couples and friends who can’t help playing with their smartphones instead of engaging with each other. That impulse is observable under test conditions too. A 2012 study showed that younger adults switch tasks, on average, 27 times every hour. Older adults do it a little less, but 17 times every hour is still quite high. Brace yourself for this next tidbit. In 2004 in the United States, an estimated 559 people had to seek medical help after smashing into stationary objects while simultaneously texting and walking. Since then the number has surged. In 2010, the number had climbed to a whopping 1,500. And these were only the incidents serious enough to require admission to medical centers. Why do people put themselves in constant danger because of this behavior? You would think that no phone is that important. It turns out that there are four factors at play which keep our eyes fixed on these screens: boredom, anxiety, accessibility and lack of metacognition. Boredom decreases when people switch between tasks and information sources. That’s particularly true if you go from a work-related information stream to an “entertainment-related” one, like Facebook or YouTube. Professor Leo Yeykelis proved this with his colleagues in a 2014 study at Stanford University. They equipped students with wrist sensors that used galvanic skin response (GSR) to monitor their arousal level while working on their computers at home. The researchers found that there was an observable increase in their arousal level just before they switched between tasks. It was most noticeable when they switched from work to entertainment-related tasks. Anxiety levels also decrease when we change information feeds. We feel anxiety if we're unable to check our smartphones or social media. This has been termed FOMO or “fear of missing out,” and it can be observed in young adults if they go 15 minutes without looking at their smart devices. It’s this self-derived anxiety which causes us to interrupt ourselves. Access to technology is nowadays more or less a given in most parts of the world. It’s like constantly having access to a never-ending box of chocolates – easy to overdo it. Smartphones, for example, are always connected to the internet, so email and the temptations of social media are just a finger tap away. Finally, there’s metacognition or being aware of what your brain is up to. If you’re self-aware that you’re switching tasks, you’re less likely to become distracted. However, if you lack metacognition, then you’ll find it pretty hard to resist looking at your smartphone. All this shows that we just don’t have the tools to confront the ever-expanding cornucopia of temptation that modern technology represents. We can’t seem to stop ourselves getting distracted. So what are we going to do about it? There are two ways to improve your cognitive control. You can either alter your brain, or you can change your behavior. In this blink, we’ll explore the former. Don’t worry: modifying your brain does not involve using surgical tools! The brain is plastic, which means it's able to constantly change its own structure, physiology and chemistry. Consequently, many scientists think the brain’s cognitive control can be enhanced. There are several ways to change your brain. The most effective method for both children and adults is also the simplest: physical exercise. It’s well known that exercise will improve physical and mental health, but it’s also been shown to induce neural changes that boost cognitive control. A 2009 study published in Pediatrics showed that physically-fit children exhibit better cognitive control than those who are less fit. The children were connected to a virtual reality environment and placed on a treadmill. They were instructed to cross a virtual street within the environment either while chatting on the phone or listening to music. The results showed that the fitter children were less distracted. Another way to modify the brain is through cognitive exercises, otherwise known as brain training. There are many types. Just like toning your body at the gym, if there’s going to be a noticeable effect, you’ll have to repeat the exercises regularly and adapt as you improve. As you get better, the exercises have to get harder. In 1998, an experiment called the ACTIVE trial was conducted. The idea was to examine if attention – one of the brain’s major cognitive-control abilities – would improve in older adults when compared to a control group if they underwent cognitive training. The results were astounding. Even ten years later in follow-up tests, the participants reported that they had fewer difficulties in their daily lives compared to the control group. Incredibly, they even caused 50 percent fewer traffic collisions. Cognitive-control improvements can also be achieved by modifying our behavior. However, there’s no need to do a full-scale “digital detox” and delete Facebook or Twitter, or even cut yourself off from the internet altogether unless you feel you’re addicted. Just a little less should do it. The trick is to depress interference by increasing metacognition while decreasing boredom, anxiety and access to technology. That’s to say, the four factors we looked at earlier. The most noticeable effects occur when we look at the impact of reducing interference for car drivers. It’s possible to increase metacognition if you familiarize yourself with the well-documented research which demonstrates the danger of texting and driving simultaneously. This awareness will discourage you from doing it yourself. For instance, a study that might help you increase your metacognition was published by the US National Safety Council. This found that using mobile phones while driving caused 23 percent of all car crashes nationwide. That also explains why most states have banned the practice. You might begin by reducing access to technology. Sure, you could lock your phone in the trunk, but there are also plenty of apps like DriveOFF and DriveMode that will block incoming texts, emails and phone calls while you drive. If you start getting bored while driving, there’s no need to reach for your phone. Chat with your passengers, fire up an audiobook, podcast or some music. According to a recent study by David Strayer, a professor at the University of Utah, each of these activities is far less distracting for drivers than talking on the phone. Finally, you can lower your anxiety by forewarning colleagues, friends and family of your regular commute time. That way they won’t call you, and you’ll have no reason to fear you’re missing a phone call or a text. Alternatively, an app like Live2Txt will reply automatically to people trying to get hold of you and let them know you’re driving and will get back to them shortly. Now that we know how to deal with interference while driving, let’s look at doing the same while socializing. If you ever pop your head into a social environment like a café or restaurant, then you’re sure to see people fiddling with their phones when they’re meant to be chatting with the people right in front of them. Even in these social situations, interference seemingly can’t be avoided. However, with a little bit of effort, you can combat that. Once more, you have to target metacognition, boredom, anxiety and access to technology. Let’s start with metacognition. You should be aware that mobile devices ruin relationships. A 2013 study at the University of Essex showed that the mere fact that a phone was in the room was enough for two people to feel less close and less empathetic during conversation. The phone didn’t even have to be picked up or checked. Its presence reduced mutual trust and understanding. Now, do you feel like you should put your phone away for a bit? The most effective way to reduce accessibility to mobile devices is to simply put them down and not use them. Less drastically, you could make your bedroom or dining area “technology-free zones.” It’s oh-so-easy to reach for your phone when you’re bored. This means you should reduce your boredom – try to actively make sure that everyone is engaged in the conversation you’re having. That way, you won’t miss out on anything interesting or titillating that gets brought up – even at family dinner time! Finally, just as when you’re commuting, telling people your schedule will reduce your anxiety that you might be missing out. If they know that you eat between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., they’ll just call you later or earlier. There's really nothing to fear. There’s no doubt that modern technology can help us in our lives. But too much can be detrimental. Use its power in moderation and, as the old saying goes, “nothing in excess!\" The key message in this book: The human brain is capable of some astonishing feats. But its evolutionary history has left it susceptible to distractions and interruptions. Such interference stops us reaching our goals as quickly and efficiently as we would like. Luckily, there are ways to train your brain and improve your cognitive control. Actionable advice: Meditate! It’s not only physical and cognitive exercises that help you mitigate the brain’s cognitive limitations. Meditation has been proven to improve cognitive control. You might want to consider making time for mediation on a regular basis. Don’t know what to do?

But carving out some time to pursue those goals often seems impossible. Work and family commitments, housework and social engagements just seem to swallow up every waking hour, leaving little time for you to dedicate to your personal development. But the real problem, Jeff Sanders argues, isn’t so much the absence of time but our perception of it. In short, we’ve been thinking about time the wrong way. The most common error? Dividing our days into separate categories – “work time” and “free time,” above all. The key to getting the most out of life, Sanders believes, is to abolish that distinction and learn to see all our time as “free.” What really matters is how we use it. And that’s just what these blinks will teach you how to do. Finding time for activities you find meaningful is all about maximizing your efficiency both at work and outside of it. Do that, and you’ll be amazed to discover just how much you can fit into an average day! So read on to learn: why you should be thinking about your priority in the singular; how to filter out distractions; and why exercise should be your primary concern, rather than an afterthought. We often divide time into separate compartments. On one hand, there’s the time we devote to the things we have to do, above all work. Once that’s done, we get to enjoy our free time, or so the thinking goes. The problem, however, isn’t that you don’t have enough time off – it’s that the very concept of “free time” is false. The reality is that you’re already free to do whatever you want with your time. But wait, that can’t be true – after all, you have your job and family, right? Well, yes, but when you get down to it, there’s nothing really stopping you from quitting your job and leaving your family; it’s just that most people don’t! In truth, there’s no such thing as free time. What you have are the hours of the day when you’re not sleeping. And if you want to start getting the most out your time, you should be thinking about all your waking hours. That brings us to the first key point about time management: learning to prioritize and beat procrastination. But prioritizing is hard. Whether it’s the overwhelming number of possibilities on offer or that impossibly long to-do list you carry around with you in your head, there are distractions lurking around every corner. The more you set out to get done, the easier it is to wind up not doing anything. This comes down to the fact that the human brain just isn’t very good at multitasking. In fact, it works best when you just prioritize one task. In fact, one of the biggest time-management challenges in existence – procrastination – is closely related to poor prioritization. Say you’ve got an important project that needs wrapping up by the end of the week. If you don’t prioritize it, push it to the top of your agenda and get down to work right now, you’ll inevitably end up wasting half the week watering your office plants, surfing the web and getting bogged down in the minor details of some event that’s coming up in two months. Needless to say, leaving your most important tasks to the last minute is deeply counterproductive. So how do you learn the art of prioritization? Well, that’s exactly what we’ll be looking at in the next blink. People often talk about their priorities in the plural. That’s a common mistake and a fairly recent one at that. As Greg McKeown, the author of Essentialism, points out, it was only after 1900 that people stopped talking about “their priority” in the singular. If we want to get a handle on our to-do lists, we’d do well to return to that more realistic way of talking about the things we prioritize. Why? Well, as we’ve seen, the brain isn’t really equipped to deal with multiple jobs at the same time. Ask it to focus on several parallel commitments, and it’ll end up losing its focus entirely. In fact, the best the brain can do is rapidly switch from one task to the next. But that’s not a sustainable solution. It leads to tiredness and distraction, as you’ll doubtless know from the last time you tried to do it. That means your best bet to get something important done is to tune out all distractions. It doesn’t matter whether you’re writing a report or painting a picture; what you really need is concentration. So switch off your phone, gather the necessary equipment and find a quiet room. Even better, make sure you’ve been to the toilet and had a snack before you start. Do that and you’ll have a good few hours to focus on nothing but the task at hand. But wait – let’s rewind a second. You can only start that report or painting once you’ve gotten through everything else on your to-do list, right? Well, no. Getting down to the things that are important to you is all about making them your priority – singular. So take another look at that list and ask yourself whether it’s possible to make some edits. Chances are, there will be some tasks on there that you can simply cross out. Take another look and you’ll find others that can be taken care of next week. In other cases, you’ll find jobs that you could feasibly delegate to someone else. Eliminate all those, and you won’t just have a shorter list – you’ll also have a much clearer sense of the task you need to start focusing on right now! There’s nothing more important than your health. After all, if you’re not in good physical shape, you’re not going to be able to take care of your other commitments. That means exercise should be at the center of your plans, rather than an afterthought. But how do you fit it in, especially when you’re busy? A good place to start is reminding yourself that making time for exercise isn’t a distraction from work – it’ll actually help you get through your tasks more efficiently. In fact, you’ll most likely be gaining time by freeing up some space in your schedule for your workout routine. That means your number one priority should be exercise rather than work. So start off by penciling in your morning run or midday yoga class, and then add your other commitments around that. But you don’t have to spend hours in the gym. In fact, short exercise sessions are much more effective. Just 10 to 15 minutes of working out intensely in the morning is more than enough to set your body up for a productive day. If you’ve settled on weightlifting to keep yourself fit and healthy, then aim to complete quick bursts followed by 15 to 30-second breathers. And you don’t need fancy equipment – free weights or even your own body weight actually work on more muscles than machines. The key is to start out gently and gradually increase the tempo and strenuousness of your workout. Build up slowly, and you’ll be amazed at how much you’ll achieve in just 15 minutes. The result? You’ll feel more focused and ready to take on the world! One of the key insights from today’s increasingly popular spiritual teachings is that letting go of unnecessary burdens can help you declutter your home and free up valuable headspace. Like the soundtrack of Disney’s Frozen movie, the new mantra seems to be “let it go!” That makes a lot of sense when it comes to managing your time as well. Take it from Joshua Becker, the author of Minimalism and one of the eponymous movement’s most well-known advocates. Becker argues that getting rid of stuff you don’t really need is a liberating experience. It frees up more time and resources, and it cuts a huge amount of stress out of your life. The best place to start is with your wardrobe. Out of all the clothes they own, most people typically wear only about 30 percent of them on a regular basis. Donating the other 70 percent to charity doesn’t just declutter your home; it also streamlines your day-to-day life, cutting out unnecessary decisions about what to wear and teaching you the true value of the things you have. However, minimalism isn’t just about tossing out useless material possessions. In fact, you’ll probably gain a whole lot more by jettisoning psychological baggage. Take perfectionism. When Jeff Sanders moved into his new house in Nashville, Tennessee, he inherited a large, dilapidated yard. His next-door neighbor was a landscape architect and had lovingly crafted an exquisite lawn surrounded by carefully planted borders. Fired on by his innate perfectionism, Sanders decided he’d do the same thing. He spent hours in the yard working on a design to rival his neighbor’s. But he didn’t get much of out his backbreaking labor of mowing, weeding, trimming and mulching. He realized that his heart wasn’t really in it and, even if it had been, he just didn’t have a green thumb. Gardening, it turned out, wasn’t an important priority in his life. So rather than wasting any more of his time pursuing this futile project, he decided to abandon the competitive and perfectionistic mindset that had driven him into the garden in the first place. It was a sound decision; he used the energy and time he would’ve wasted in his yard to write this book! When Sanders was at college, he found out that his school’s cafeteria offered an all-you-can-eat buffet three times a day. It was a fantastic deal for a hard-up student, and he soon found himself eating most of his meals there. Soon enough, he was piling on the pounds – every day was “cafeteria day.”  It wasn’t great for his health, but the experience taught him something important: scheduling themed days is one of the smartest ways to improve your time management. As we’ve seen, accomplishing the things that matter the most is all about making them your priority – singular. Theme days do just that, allowing you to focus all your attention and energy on one task. That’s something Sanders regularly puts into practice. These days, he avoids the cafeteria and devotes days to personal projects like developing a podcast about motivational speaking and coaching. In fact, his whole week is built around pursuing well-defined priorities. He focuses on podcasting on Mondays, marketing on Tuesdays, education on Wednesdays, administration on Thursdays and meetings on Fridays. Health and exercise fill up his Saturdays, while Sundays are for quality time with his family. Sometimes, however, it’s impossible to devote a whole day to just one task. The solution? Bundle similar tasks together to keep your mind focused. So say you’ve set aside Monday for marketing, and you know you’ll spend most of the day working on your computer. That’s a great opportunity to get a whole load of related jobs done. Writing emails and preparing presentations or promotional materials are all thematically linked, after all. But remember what we said about the brain’s inability to multitask? Well, it’s important to make sure you divide the day into sections so you can work through one thing at a time. Look for themes to help you do that. You could, for example, put aside a couple of hours for email promotion in the morning and then turn to social media promotion in the afternoon. The key point is that the more specific your bundles are, the greater your efficiency will be as you go through your to-do list. We’ve all been there: the stars align and grant you your wish of an afternoon off, but all you end up doing with those precious hours is binge-watching your way through a so-so TV series. This is due to the fact that we often fail to plan for the unexpected and don’t know how to make the most of unforeseen strokes of luck. Planning to be spontaneous might sound like an odd concept, but it’s actually pretty simple. Essentially, it’s all about creating a “just in case” list of things you’d like to do. Obviously, it’s best to be realistic here and come up with activities that you can feasibly fit into the amount of free time you might end up with. So if it’s plausible that you might get a 15-minute breather at work, ask yourself what you could squeeze into a quarter of an hour. For example, It could be a quick yoga session or a brisk walk around the block. Think you might be able to grab an hour away from your desk? How about picking out a book you’d like to read and keeping it handy just in case? If it’s a full afternoon that might be about to open up, you could think about getting out of the office altogether and going for a swim or a bike ride. Whatever it is that you end up adding to your list, the most important thing is that it’s an activity you’ll genuinely enjoy. But even if you don’t get an unexpected hour of downtime during the week, you’ve always got the weekend to look forward to. That’s also something you should be planning for. After all, while there’s nothing inherently wrong with a low-key couple of days of doing nothing much at all, you’re bound to feel much more energized and refreshed come Monday if you’ve done something memorable. So how do you do that? Well, aim to do something meaningful. If you’ve always fancied picking up an instrument, the weekend is your ideal opportunity to start practicing your guitar chops. The same goes for learning a language, working out how to fix up old bikes or going on that hiking tour you’ve always dreamed about. There’s no getting around it: social media is often little more than a mildly entertaining way of wasting time. Sure, it might be fun now and then, but mostly it’s the number one reason you don’t get important but difficult tasks done. In other words, the downsides vastly outweigh the benefits. That’s a great reason to cut out technological distractions if you want to improve your time management. That doesn’t mean you have to renounce tech altogether and become a neo-Luddite. What it does mean is that you should start looking at which technologies are helping you achieve your aims and which are undermining your efficiency. Even social media can be of aid to you, as long as you’re primarily using it to connect with friends and colleagues or to build your network. But if you’re mindlessly scrolling through your Twitter feed or looking at photos on Facebook instead of working on something important, it might be time to rethink your social media usage. How you choose to go about eliminating these kinds of distractions depends on how much of an issue they are for you. Hopelessly addicted to social media? Delete your account. If it’s less drastic than that, simply switching off your devices now and again should do the trick. Other options include creating a work-focused computer account and disabling the sites that tend to sidetrack you. But it’s not just technology, apps and smartphones that prevent you from getting down to meaningful or important tasks. Often enough, it’s your own meandering thoughts that stand in your way. Concentrating on the work at hand when your brain keeps wandering off is next to impossible. Even worse, losing your train of thought can make that brilliant idea you just had virtually impossible to recover. So what’s the solution? Well, it’s actually a pretty simple: make sure you always have a notepad nearby and keep a record of your best ideas before they disappear into thin air. That’s a great way of giving yourself a prompt when you return from your daydreams. Just look down at your last entry, and you’ll be able to pick up the thread where you left off! Social media isn’t the only addiction that prevents us from using our time effectively. If anything, workaholism is an ever greater issue in contemporary society. These days, many executives and CEOs adhere to punishing work regimens, but there are also cases of them making reckless decisions, perhaps driven by exhaustion. The evidence suggests that working yourself too hard is neither healthy nor helpful. Take it from Sanders, a one-time workaholic who fell into precisely this trap. Years of grueling, 100-hour workweeks ended up seriously undermining his well-being. He suffered panic attacks, couldn’t sleep and became dependent on endless cups of coffee to keep him going. But it wasn’t just his health that suffered. He also became increasingly irritable and ended up having endless arguments with the companies that had hired him as a productivity consultant. That experience is one of the reasons he wound up writing this book: there just had to be a different – and better – way of doing things. Well, there is. Downtime, Sanders realized, isn’t a frivolous luxury; it’s an essential part of setting yourself up for success and happiness. So how do you make sure you’re getting enough of it? Well, you need to start planning breaks in your schedule. Think of them as sabbaticals – periods of time in which you can recharge your batteries and recenter yourself. The key is to start small and build from there. So take a look at your diary and see what’s in store for you tomorrow. Chances are, you’ll be able to free up an hour of me-time. Now think about the week ahead of you. Can you juggle your commitments around so that you have an afternoon off to unwind? How about next month? Can you find time for a weekend away? Finally, take a look at the big picture; your aim here is to make space for a proper annual vacation of two weeks or more. Do that, and you’ll be amazed at how much time you can free up to relax and get away from the daily grind. Free time might feel like an increasingly rare resource, but it’s often just a matter of perception. Optimize your day-to-day schedule by following the advice in these blinks, and you’ll find that your evenings, weekends and holidays will become much more enjoyable and meaningful. The key message in these blinks: The concept of “free time” is deeply misleading. In fact, all of our time – even when we’re at work – is free; what really matters is how we use it. That’s where the art of time management comes in. Once you learn to maximize your efficiency, stop procrastinating and set manageable priorities, you can start using your time as efficiently as possible, getting the most out of both your working day and your time away from the office.  Actionable advice: Clarify your professional and personal goals.  Before you start any kind of scheduling work, you’ll need to know exactly what it is you want to achieve. The key is to avoid a scattershot approach. After all, if you try to pursue hundreds of different goals at once, you’ll likely find yourself struggling to meet any one of them. So whittle down your aims to just two or three of the most important objectives and focus on those. They could be completing a major work project, spending more quality time with your family or learning a new language. Whatever they are, clarifying what you want to achieve will make it much easier to structure your time. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: Leisure, by Josef Pieper Follow the advice in these blinks, and you’ll soon find yourself with much more spare time on your hands. So what do you do with all those extra hours? Well, if you want to understand leisure, it’s a good idea to take a look at its history. That’s just what the German philosopher Josef Pieper does in his classic 1952 study of the subject. A meditation on the importance of unstructured time for the good life, Peiper’s argument is truly ahead of its time in rejecting overwork.

Wegner and Kurt Gray","summary":"Imagine this scenario: you’re alone in a universe of mindless beings. Everyone around you only appears to have a mind – even your mother is really a zombie who merely simulates the behavior of a conscious creature. Although it’s an outlandish idea, we can’t unequivocally disprove this scenario. But, somehow, we’re generally convinced that we’re surrounded by conscious, sentient creatures. So, how do other people convince you that they have a mind? How do you decide whether your dog, your unborn child or your wonderful new computer belong to the Mind Club? And is this always a question of in or out, yes or no? These are just some of the questions that will be discussed in these blinks. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why some people can hit a CEO without being punished; how the minds of God and Google are alike; and the story of someone acquitted for murder thanks to his sleep lab results. You’re part of a special club and you might not even know it. Chances are your neighbor and cat are as well, but your smartphone isn’t – at least not yet. This club is called the Mind Club, and it’s the group of all creatures considered to have a mind. So, who qualifies? Well, the authors conducted several studies in which participants were asked about the mental characteristics of various beings: a robot, a CEO, a family dog, a dead person and so on. They found that people generally attribute a mind to beings with two specific traits. The first is agency, or the ability to think, act in a planned manner and control oneself. The second is the ability to experience emotions like happiness, to be conscious and to feel physical sensations, like hunger. It’s that simple; if someone has these abilities, they’re in the Mind Club. But once in the Mind Club, people can be characterized by the relative strength of their agency and experience. For instance, if you’re primarily characterized by your propensity for rational action, then you fit into the group of thinking doers. A prime example of this group are the CEOs of big corporations; they are generally considered to be thinking doers since they wield lots of power and have engaged in loads of planned action to get to where they are. On the other side of the spectrum are the vulnerable feelers, those who primarily feel and experience, but are less apt when it comes to effective action. Babies belong in this category. If they’re threatened and experience fear, they can’t plan to defend themselves and, therefore, their only response is to cry. But these types aren’t immutable. A CEO could turn into a vulnerable feeler if, say, an illness rendered him entirely helpless. Whether it’s rich and poor or parent and child, certain concepts come in pairs and it’s impossible to understand one without its counterpart. And this is exactly the case with morality. We understand moral acts as involving two parties: the moral agent, or the person who engages in the action, and the moral patient, the person who receives the action. This pairing is called dyadic completion and here’s how it works: Whenever something or someone becomes a victim, such as by being hit by a car, or is the recipient of something good, like a gift, we automatically look for the person who inflicted the pain or offered the generosity – that is, the moral agent. But how we judge moral acts doesn’t depend solely on the deed. It’s also influenced by the type of mind the doer and receiver appear to possess. Imagine the CEO of a powerful corporation punching a baby. It’s unthinkable, totally outrageous and he’d surely be sent to prison. But if the tables were turned and the baby punched the CEO, we would see it as cute or funny. The baby certainly wouldn’t be blamed for its actions. So, while the CEO did the exact same thing as the baby, we’re more inclined to see him as a moral agent, since he’s a thinking doer. In other words, we see him as acting consciously and in control of his actions. Therefore, we assume he deliberately inflicted pain on the baby and should be held responsible. However, we rarely view vulnerable feelers as moral agents because we don’t see them as being able to act deliberately. In other words, when the baby punches the CEO, we don’t assume he’s doing it to inflict pain. And since vulnerable feelers are geared toward experience and not agency, we tend to see them as moral patients and focus on their moral rights to, say, not be hurt, rather than on their moral responsibilities. Next, we’ll see how when we want to inflict an inherently immoral act upon a person, we try to deny the existence of their mind. Have you ever wondered how a soldier might appear to be a genuinely kind person when he’s at the park in his hometown, but then cruelly torture and kill civilians once he’s shipped overseas? Well, it’s largely due to a psychological phenomenon known as dehumanization, the process of denying that someone has a mind to validate the poor treatment we inflict upon them. We do this to ease the guilt about the bad deed and numb ourselves to the pain we’re inflicting on others. For instance, to do such barbaric acts to other humans, that soldier has to convince himself that the unfamiliar people he is suddenly faced with aren’t human at all; he has to convince himself that they don’t think or feel like him or those he grew up with. Once he’s done that, he won’t feel guilty about hurting them. This is why we dehumanize, but the process can happen in two different ways: animalization and mechanization. These two strategies work because, as we know, we only perceive people as having a mind if they have agency and experience; dehumanization eliminates one or the other. The first mode, animalization, is when a person convinces himself that another person isn’t an agent like he is, but rather an unthinking feeler, someone who cannot make his own decisions and who therefore benefits from being controlled by another. During the colonial era of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, white Europeans labelled African natives “savages,” depicting them as immoral, weak-willed creatures and implying that they were doing the natives a favor by treating them like pets, housing, feeding and subduing them. The other mode, mechanization, is just the opposite. It occurs when someone denies that the other has feelings and therefore perceives them as an extreme version of a thinking doer. This allows the moral agent to mistreat others because we empathize with someone only if we think they can feel. For instance, during World War II, US propaganda depicted the Japanese as evil people who never tire, continuously functioning like ruthless machines. Just as it’s impossible to say if your childhood cat died because it’s what God wanted, when dealing with humans, we can’t always tell if something was done by an intentional doer or an agent. For instance, sleepwalkers might appear to be acting consciously, even in a planned manner; but in reality, they’re fast asleep. Just take Kenneth Parks, the gentle young man who killed his mother-in-law while he was sleeping. At first, the court couldn’t believe that he’d been entirely unaware of what he was doing. But as sleep specialists testified about Parks’ abnormal brain activity during sleep, his account gained plausibility and he was eventually acquitted. So, on the face of it, we can’t be sure whether any actions other than our own are the result of a conscious person acting intentionally. However, our chances of survival (and procreation) increase if we suspect intentional minds to be at work everywhere. Say you’re alone in the jungle and hear a rustling in the bushes. It’s hard to tell whether it’s caused by a hungry lion, creeping up on your camp, or just the wind blowing through the grass. But it’s better for you to assume the first option is true. If you do and run away immediately, you’ll be safe from the lion if it’s there; if it’s not, the worst you’ll suffer is a bit of embarrassment. There are plenty of other examples of how a compulsion to see minds everywhere helps us survive. But despite all the advantages of this tendency, it can also lead to paranoid delusions. For instance, someone might begin to suspect scheming minds or terrorists to be behind every outbreak of swine flu. So, most people agree that adult humans have high levels of both agency and experience – in other words, that they have minds. People also tend to agree that denying such minds is immoral. But what about the minds out there that can only be perceived by some and not others? Unless your best friends are philosophers, they probably won’t challenge the assumption that your older sister has a mind. But besides the more typical members of the Mind Club, like your sister, there’s another, more divisive class. They’re called the cryptominds and they’re only allowed entry by some gatekeepers. People disagree about whether any given cryptomind has a mind at all. The group includes beings like God, animals and robots, along with dead and permanently unconscious people in persistent vegetative states. And the same differences apply within the category of cryptominds. For instance, there are predominantly thinking doers, like God and Google, both of which are immensely powerful and have tremendous agency, but are seen as unable to feel. On the other end of the spectrum is the baby mouse, which appears as an extreme vulnerable feeler since it experiences hunger, pleasure and other feelings while not engaging in much deliberate action. So how can we tell if a cryptomind truly has a mind? Well, simply put, something has a mind if we perceive it as having one. This proof comes from the British mathematician Alan Turing who, in 1950, suggested the Turing Test to determine whether a machine has a mind. While the test was created for machines, it has something to teach us about minds in general. The Turing Test has a person exchange text messages with a human and a computer, and then asks the person to determine which of his conversation partners was the other human. Turing’s argument was that if a computer can convince someone that it has a human mind, then it does, because a mind is real as long as we perceive it to be. However, since the computer could easily convince some people and not others, its mind remains a matter of perception that could be real for one person, but not for another. As such, there’s only one mind that you can be certain you’ll perceive: your own. It’s the only mind that’s real to you, which makes the Mind Club rather exclusive after all. The key message in this book: The mind is a matter of perception, and the way we view another being’s mind depends on whether or not we see them as having agency and the ability to experience. As a result, humans can disagree about whether someone has a mind, and our decisions can have major impacts on those people’s lives.  Got feedback?

How many tabs on your internet browser? And how many different e-mail threads and Facebook messages? If you’re like most people, you probably have a lot of each of these – too many, in fact. The myth of multitasking has seeped into every aspect of our lives, not only in terms of how we communicate but also the way we work and live the rest of our day-to-day lives. And multitasking might be a bigger problem than you think; not only is splitting our time into fragments not helpful or efficient, it is actually counterproductive. In these blinks, you’ll learn why “multitasking” isn’t even an accurate name for what it describes; why you should set designated office hours; and how you can find more time for the things you love. These days, with more ways than ever to be connected and communicate with one another, it can feel like there’s an endless supply of tasks that demand to be juggled all at once. Appropriately enough, the traditional way of dealing with multiple tasks at once was to multitask. But here’s the thing: multitasking is a lie. A more accurate name for this method of working is switchtasking, and it is an inefficient and inadequate way of getting things done. The human brain is an impressive thing to behold, but it doesn’t perform well when you attempt to focus on more than one thing at a time. There are plenty of studies to back this up, including a recent one from Vanderbilt University. Researchers couldn’t find a single piece of neurological evidence to suggest that the human brain is capable of taking on more than one task at a time. What the brain can do is switch back and forth, from one task to another. It can do this quickly enough to give you the impression that it is multitasking, but what it is really doing is switchtasking. Now, there are two different kinds of switchtasking: you can either make active switches or passive switches. Active switches happen in situations you create yourself, such as deciding to check your e-mail while talking to someone on the phone. These would be switches that you are actively making. Passive switches happen in situations that are initiated by something or someone else. An example of this would be when you’re facing a deadline and, in the middle of preparing documents, a coworker decides to stop by and start talking to you. Here, you’re being asked to switch your attention between the documents and your coworker. In the blinks ahead, we’ll take a closer look at why these switches are so harmful to your work and what you can do to reduce them in the workplace. At one time or another, you may have been proud of your ability to switch between multiple tasks and highlighted this talent on your resume. But the truth is, switchtasking isn’t an effective or time-saving way of working. For a good example, let’s look at a typical workday scenario: Helen is a hardworking CEO for a successful retail clothing company. But every hour of every day, she’ll usually have to deal with multiple interruptions. A typical scenario would find Helen trying to compose an e-mail when her assistant, Sally, interrupts with an important question. Since Helen needs to get her e-mails out quickly, at first, she’ll attempt to continue typing and switch her attention back and forth between Sally and the e-mail. However, since Sally’s question are generally complex, Helen will eventually be forced to stop typing and give the question her full attention in order to come up with an answer. Once she gives Sally an answer, Helen can switch back to the e-mail, but it is important to recognize that it will take her a few minutes before she can get back to the level of focus she had previously. This is why switching between tasks is ultimately inefficient and a waste of time, because whether you are making active or passive switches, you will inevitably need to stop one train of thought to start another. When Helen realized she couldn’t give her e-mail or Sally’s question the attention they each required and deserved, she had to stop what she was doing. And no matter what, switching takes extra time to focus on the new task and then refocus on the old task, both of which eat up valuable time from the day. You’re probably wondering, “How can I avoid switching? Aren’t these interruptions just a fact of life?” In the blinks ahead we’ll find out how you can minimize the amount of switching in your day, and maximize the efficiency of your work. Let’s say you’re the busy CEO of a successful company. What steps could you take to reduce interruptions and minimize switches? One of the most common reasons for someone to come knocking on your door is that they don’t know when they’ll be able to get your attention otherwise. The solution here is to set a schedule of recurring meetings with the coworkers who need your input the most. This way, they’ll know that they can save their questions until the next scheduled meeting and will get their answer soon enough. And since they won’t have to knock on your door, you’ll get uninterrupted time to focus on your work between these meetings. For our beleaguered CEO, Helen, once she set up a daily meeting with Sally at 10:00 a.m. every morning, she no longer had to hear Sally knock on her door a dozen times every day. Another way to keep interruptions at bay is to set a regular period when your office door is open to any employees who may need your help. Most stores aren’t open 24/7, and that works out just fine because customers are well aware of when they can show up to get what they need. The same concept can work for your office: set up regular office hours during which anyone can show up to ask questions or get the clarifications they need. Be clear about these times by posting the hours on your door and sending a mass email to everyone in your company or organization. You can also take a similar step to take care of those annoying phone calls: leave an outgoing message on your voicemail that tells callers when they can expect to get in touch with you. For example, you could leave a message that says something like, “I’m currently unavailable, as I’m either in a meeting or with a customer. Please know that I check my messages daily at 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., so if you leave a brief message, I will get back to you shortly.” Think back to last week and ask yourself, “How many hours did I spend watching TV, sleeping or commuting to and from work – and how many did I actually spend working?” Even if you’re passionate about your work, you might not be aware of how you really spend your time. This is what Helen, our clothing company CEO, realized after meeting with a business consultant who asked her to add up her weekly activities. Helen estimated that, alongside many other tasks, she spent 49 hours sleeping, 28 hours with her family and 70 hours per week working. But this was impossible since there are only 168 hours in a week and all of Helen’s estimates added up to 190. This revealed a common misconception most people have about how they spend their time. When Helen reconsidered, she realized that she’d overestimated the amount of time she spent with her family. Even when she was at home, Helen was often still working by responding to emails and reading trade magazines. By switchtasking between her family and her work, Helen had given herself the illusion of spending more hours with her family, even though she wasn’t really present during this time. This realization left Helen devastated because she loved her family dearly and wanted to prioritize them above her work. So, if you want to make sure that you’re spending your time when and where you want to, create a schedule and make a time budget for the future. First of all, be honest and accurate about how you’re currently spending your time, and write your activities down on the schedule. This should help you identify the areas that you would like to improve upon, whether it’s finding more time for family and friends, or perhaps putting more hours toward a new project that you’d like to focus on. Next, you can make a future time budget. If you want to spend more time exercising or with your kids, block off this time so that it will be devoted to what’s important to you. Let’s put on the CEO hat one more time and find out what can be done to get your employees to stop switchtasking and start focusing on one task at a time. Your first instinct might be to hold a meeting and simply tell everyone to stop switchtasking – but there’s a more effective way to change people’s habits. Since the idea of multitasking has been idealized for so long, getting people to recognize the better way and change their habits should be seen as a process. You can do this by setting an example and allowing your employees to see firsthand how inefficient switchtasking is and how much time they can save by focusing on tasks one at a time. So don’t force change among employees. Establish a personal system that will go on to influence the larger business system. As the CEO or division head, your personal system might be different from how others operate, but once it becomes clear that it provides superior results, it will become the accepted way of doing business. So start implementing the anti-switchtasking changes from the previous blinks: set regularly scheduled meetings, post regular office hours and start managing your emails and phone calls in a focused and deliberate manner. All of these policies will soon influence broader business protocols in a positive way. Employees will notice that your way of operating is reliable and consistent, while also making you available and responsive to employees when necessary. Before long, they’ll be implementing these policies in their own work. In their interactions with you, it will be clear how effective it is to focus on one task at a time. And when they inevitably begin to adopt this approach themselves, it will be even more effective because it wasn’t forced upon them and they made the choice to do so themselves. Once this happens, you’ll have a highly efficient business on your hands. The key message in this book: It is time to close the book on multitasking. This flawed notion of being able to do everything at once has been a drain on workplaces for far too long. The fact of the matter is that dividing our attention among more than one task at a time is simply impossible; what we are really doing is switching back and forth between activities and tasks and, as a result, are spending more time getting less done. Actionable advice: Try a simple exercise to prove that multitasking is inefficient and eats up your time. Grab a pen and a piece of paper and set a timer. Now, prepare yourself to write a short sentence, such as “Multitasking is really switchtasking.” For every letter, write a number underneath that letter, starting with the number one and proceeding in order. So, start the timer and write “M,” then write “1” underneath it. Then write “U,” followed by a “2” underneath it, and so on until the end of the sentence; stop the timer when you’re done. Now, start the timer and, this time, write the sentence in full first and then write all the numbers underneath each letter afterward. The results will be clear: it’s always faster to do one thing at a time. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Not a nice clean new house, but a creaky old house that’s been renovated time and time again.   Like a big house, your brain is full of information: memories, plans, ideas, etc. But it’s not like that information is neatly filed away. To help you survive, the human brain developed complex systems and processes to prioritize, store, and retrieve all the information you come across. Sometimes these systems get tripped up. When that happens, the house becomes uninhabitable, wouldn’t even pass a safety inspection. But obviously, you can’t move out of your brain. Instead, you lose your keys. You forget what you were going to say, right in the middle of a sentence. And you’re less productive, because you can’t keep your priorities straight. Your hopes and dreams, everything you have planned, are impossible with a disorganized mind. But why is that? The answer is in that old creaky house. You have to know how each floor was built – you know, which walls are load-bearing, where the water pipes are – if you want to, say, add central heating, or build a new patio. The Organized Mind explains how the house was built so you can take charge of the essential information in your brain. The brain processes and organizes information through various systems. One of those systems is the attentional system, which determines the way your brain handles and organizes information – anything your brain pays attention to, in other words. In the creaky old house that is your brain, the attentional system is one of the pillars holding everything together. Over thousands of years, evolution developed a more nuanced system that can be neatly summed up in one little sentence: our brain evolved to focus on one thing at a time. This thing was always the most important thing. Just picture our ancestors, tens of thousands of years ago, on the hunt. They’re hiding in a bush, clutching their spears. It was a matter of life and death for them to be able to set aside any possible distraction and focus every ounce of their attention on the wooly mammoth – or whatever they were hunting. Only the most important things (like an approaching predator) disrupted their thoughts and caught their attention. Nowadays, we put our attentional system under stress, because our brains aren’t equipped to cope with the flood of new facts and sights that we face everyday. These days, we’re constantly attempting to do many things at once. Driving a car, listening to the radio, thinking about an upcoming business meeting – it’s not unusual that all these things happen simultaneously. Here’s the key message: The brain can only focus on a limited number of stimuli at a time. One way we can see how our brain is better at focusing on fewer things is that our brains are more interested in change than constants. There’s an easy way to show what that means in real life. Just imagine you’re driving, and suddenly, you notice the road is bumpy. The crazy thing is, a few moments before, you weren’t consciously thinking about how flat and smooth the street was! That’s not useful information. It is useful to notice and think about the street if it suddenly feels bumpy. You could be in danger: the  road could be treacherous, or you might have popped a tire. The point is, the brain notices the bumpy road because it’s different and dangerous, and doesn’t notice the harmless flat road because it’s expected and harmless. Again, your brain focuses on what’s most important. Decisions are part of everyday life: Should we opt for the cheaper internet plan, or pay more and get unlimited data? Should we respond to this email now, or read these texts first? Nowadays, we confront decisions like these nearly every minute. Here’s the key message: we’re surrounded by more and more information, and as a result, we’re forced to make more and more decisions. So how can our brains cope with this non-stop flow of decisions when it originally evolved to process one idea at a time? It’s simple: we can manage the flood of information by focusing our attention. But how, exactly? As we learned in the previous blink, our brains instinctively concentrate on the most important information. Here’s an example: Let’s say you’re on a busy street, and your dog, Fifi, slips her leash. As you desperately search for her, your brain automatically fades out all unnecessary details – the people, cars, buildings and buses – and only focuses on things that are about the same size and color as your dog. So unless there are a lot of other things on this street that are about knee-height, fluffy and brown, your brain’s ability to focus on what’s most important makes it easier to find your beloved Fifi. So as you can see, your brain is instantly prioritizing and focusing, and – this is key – not trying to parse through all the information on the street. But when you work against the brain, when you bombard it with information and decisions, when you’re constantly switching your attention between different tasks, your brain sputters and fails, and there’s a price to pay. Remember the first point of the book? Your brain is most effective when it can focus on just a few things. This automatic process of honing our focus down to what’s necessary should also be reflected in our decision making. In other words, you shouldn’t spend too much time on less important everyday choices. Instead, you should find shortcuts and ways to simplify your decision making. Here’s an example: One type of difficult decision is about spending money on things that can make your life easier. A good way to analyze these decisions is by thinking about the monetary value of your own time, because it allows you to compare it to the benefit the product or service promises. Let’s say you’re thinking about hiring someone to clean your home instead of doing it yourself. Just ask yourself: Would you be willing to pay $50 for two extra hours of free time? If the answer is yes, then just go for it! You don’t have to spend hours trying to make this decision. The taxi is idling outside. It’s going to be tight to make the flight. The itinerary is done. You have plenty of cash. You definitely packed your favorite t-shirt. Your partner and kids are loading the bags, you do one quick check to make sure you have the passports and – oh shoot! Where are my keys? They were in my pants! Keys, glasses, phone, your favorite pen – it’s so frustrating that the objects we need with us all the time are also the ones that seem to go missing most often. But there’s no mystery to this. We lose these objects simply because we carry them around with us. Objects that we only use in one place, like a toothbrush. We rarely lose these. The good news is, there’s a neat and obvious solution: Here’s the key message: find a designated place for every single object.  Just set up designated places for the things you carry around with you: a bowl next to the door for your keys, a particular drawer at your desk for your glasses. Or, of course, you can just buy duplicates. So that’s how we come to misplace and forget things. But we haven’t talked about why our brains sputter and fail in this way. There is, in fact, a special part of our brain dedicated to remembering the location of things. It’s called the hippocampus, and it was crucial for our ancestors. They needed to know where a watering hole was, for example, or the areas where dangerous animals like to roam. In order to learn more about our hippocampi, researchers studied the brains of London taxi drivers, as they’re required to memorize the city’s street plan. They need to recall many locations in precise detail, and, sure enough, tests revealed that the drivers’ hippocampi were larger than those of other people of similar education and age. As powerful as it sounds, the hippocampus can only provide us with information about objects that have a fixed location. That’s OK for a taxi driver trying to remember where the Natural History Museum is, but it’s a problem for us when we try to remember where our infuriatingly mobile keys are. “Designate a specific location in your house that will be home to these objects. Be strict about adhering to it.” So far, we’ve looked at a few of the systems in the creaky old house of the brain, and how they influence our memory and our focus. So here’s where the really powerful part comes in. Because now we’ll talk about what you can do to make your brain as effective as possible. For example, say you were assigned a project at work and you start thinking about so many ideas and thoughts about how to get it started and they’re all just floating around inside your head. What’s the best way to deal with that? Essentially, it goes back to the attentional system: Our brains evolved to focus on only a few things at a time. Keeping so much information inside is bound to overwhelm you. The key message is: Organize your ideas outside your head. This might sound pretty abstract, so here’s an easier way to think about it: Write it down! Good old-fashioned flashcards are an easy and effective way to record and organize your ideas as soon as you think of them. For example, you might be on the bus and suddenly remember that you still have to buy a birthday present for your grandma. You could spend the rest of the day continually reminding yourself or wasting energy worrying that you’ll forget. But why put yourself through all that? Just write it down and you’ll no longer have the burden of trying to remember it all day. On the other hand, if you think of something that you could do right away – like calling your grandma to say happy birthday – then don’t think twice, do it immediately. You can think of this in terms of the two-minute rule: If the task takes longer than two minutes to complete, write it down. Otherwise, do it right away. Another effective way to lighten your mental load is to organize your written thoughts into categories. For example, say you see a flying object with feathers. Your brain pretty quickly recognizes it as part of the category “bird.” It might be a hawk or an eagle, but it’s easier for our brain to place it in this broader category rather than identify it specifically. The same goes for flashcards, or your favorite note-taking app on your phone. Every once in a while, collect your notes together and sort them into different categories, like, “Personal Life,” “Work” or “Kids.” This way you’ll be able to keep your thoughts and ideas organized and accessible.  “Writing things down conserves the mental energy expended in worrying that you might forget something and in trying not to forget it.” So, creating categories is essential to organizing our thoughts and our lives. But what should we do with the objects and ideas that don’t seem to belong in any category? We need to create a new category: think of them as junk drawers. Here’s the key message: junk drawers for miscellaneous items are incredibly effective – use them every day.  The human brain really loves to categorize, and this can be seen in the way that we organize our living spaces. In our homes, there’s usually at least one place where random objects like single light bulbs, paper clips or car-cleaning products go. Why? Because it wouldn’t make sense to have a special drawer just for light bulbs if you only had a few – combining them with other spare objects is a much more efficient use of space. You could even use a junk drawer at work. A miscellaneous folder, maybe, with documents that don’t belong in any other folders but are also too important to throw out. Just remember that junk drawers are only effective if they’re checked on from time to time. This will not only help you to keep track of what’s in there, it’s also an opportunity to clean them out. So if you’re sorting through objects that you haven’t yet needed to use, it’s unlikely that you’ll need them in the future. Just throw them out! And if you see some items that suddenly have grown in number, maybe it’s time to give them their own drawer or box somewhere else. Finally, a light bulb box! You may also find that items in junk drawers can be moved to other places later. For example, say you’ve developed an interest in scrapbooking. If you go through your junk drawer, you’ll probably find objects that could find a new home in the scrapbooking drawer – that extra pair of scissors, maybe, or the double-sided sticky tape. Writing things down, categorizing, junk drawers – these are a few ways to do what the brain really loves: reduce the number of things it’s working on at any given moment. But there are other things the brain also loves – and needs, really – to stay fit. Let’s just talk about one of those, arguably the most important one. We’re talking, of course, about sleep. Everyone knows that we’re far more productive after a good night’s sleep. And yet we’re often tempted to stay up until one or two am, just to squeeze in a few more emails or watch “just one more episode.” This is a mistake. Sleep is where the care and maintenance of the great creaky house happens. Even if you’re not aware, it’s when your house patches its own roof, applies a fresh coat of paint and moves boxes out to the garage. While we sleep, our brains are hard at work, processing new information from the day and integrating it into our existing knowledge. Memories, problems and ideas often appear in our dreams, which is partly why we’re often more likely to solve a problem after “sleeping on it.” The key message is: Set aside time to refuel so you can increase your productivity later. This phenomenon is supported by research that found that students working on a problem performed better after a night of sleep than they did working on it for the same length of waking time. In fact, the research shows that you’re actually twice as likely to solve a problem after you’ve slept on it. In other words, you’re way better off going to sleep and starting again in the morning than chugging an energy drink and trying to solve that statistics problem, or burning through another 10 emails before midnight. And apropos rest, many companies – like Microsoft, where employees use an in-house spa – have realized that employee productivity actually goes up when they’re encouraged to recharge their batteries. At Ernst & Young, 10 extra hours of vacation increased productivity by 8%. Again, it all goes back to that house – that is, the brain as house. Give it some love, treat it nicely, patch it up from time to time, and it can handle everything you throw at it. “The companies that are winning the productivity battle are those that allow their employees productivity hours, naps, a chance for exercise . . .” The key message in this book: The brain evolved to handle only a few things at a time, so be nice to it. That means, get more sleep, write things down, and don’t bombard your brain with more than it can handle. Follow that one principle and your brain will be free to work through the problems you assign it. Let’s give the last word to the author, Daniel Levitin, speaking with our own Caitlin Schiller on our podcast, Simplify. Here’s Levitin, answering the question: What’s the one thing we should do for our minds? Levitin: What a great and provocative question. I think, well, care for them is the blanket answer. And that includes things like being sure that you eat a diet that's got enough protein to help your neurons to regenerate, to function properly –– not regenerate, it's not the word I meant, but to function properly–– and to do their cellular housekeeping. Caitlin: What a wonderful phrase! Levitin: Exercise, oxygenating the brain is good, however you do it, as long as you don't oxygenate so much that you end up passing out and hitting your head. Good sleep hygiene. And as we get older, I think, one of the things that we can do for our brain that's underappreciated is try to avoid complacency. Seek out the novel, seek out the new, that's the way to stay young. Suggested further reading: How to Read a Book by Mortimer J.

It always seems like there’s something we could do better, faster or more efficiently. All too often we look to “time management” as a means of getting closer to the coveted “peak performance,” hoping – ultimately in vain – that all we need to do is squeeze more and more work into our finite, 24-hour days. If you remember the last time you pulled an all-nighter or really worked for eight hours straight, you know it’s not the right strategy. In order to perform to our best, i.e., at full engagement, we need to focus not on squeezing more into our limited hours but finding ways to do more with the time we have. To accomplish this, we need to shift our focus to managing our energy, not our time. The following blinks will talk about various kinds of energy, how they affect performance and what you can do to increase their capacity. In doing so, you can sharpen your focus, become more efficient and unlock your creative potential. Furthermore, you’ll discover how to truly balance work and play, never again having to compromise your hobbies and personal relationships for your work. In addition, these blinks will show you how doing less work can actually help you get more done, why your best ideas can often come to you in the shower, why it’s better to look for land than bail out water on a sinking ship and, finally, how to live your life according to your deepest-held values. Many of us race through life without ever taking a break: we return home exhausted from a long day’s work, feeling overwhelmed with both work and our private life. And no matter how hard we try, there’s never enough time to get everything done. But energy, not time, is the fundamental source of efficiency and high performance. Unfortunately, it’s too easy for us to forget this. Since we’re limited to 24 hours per day, we naturally focus on optimizing our time. But time alone won’t help us achieve our goals. We also need energy – without it, we can’t perform at our potential, no matter how much time we allow ourselves to do what we want! So rather than optimizing our schedules, we should focus on optimizing the quantity and quality of our available energy. One way to efficiently manage energy and get more accomplished is in fact to work less and take more breaks. When we concentrate on managing our time, many of us tend to work for hours on end without pause. But this takes a toll on our energy levels, and consequently makes us less productive. Think about it: How do you feel after working for four hours straight? Chipper and ready for more? You probably feel totally drained, and no matter how many espressos you drink, you’re still unable to keep your concentration and maintain productivity. Instead, try maximizing your energy (and therefore your productivity) by working less and taking lots of breaks. These breaks give you a chance to recharge your energy levels, thus allowing you to stay productive for more time. By focusing on managing our energy level rather than trying to cram 48 hours into a single day, we not only become more efficient, but also have energy left for our private lives. In order to make use of our energy, we must first understand what it actually is. We’re all familiar with physical energy, i.e., what we use to get around, but there are three additional sources of energy – emotional, mental and spiritual – that also require our attention. Luckily, we can use the same language as we do with physical energy – e.g., flexibility, endurance and strength – to describe the qualities of the other energies. Emotional flexibility allows us to demonstrate a wide range of emotions appropriate to a given situation rather than responding with rigidity. For instance, when faced with a threatening situation, emotional flexibility allows us to experience not only fear but also the curiosity and resilience necessary to surmount this obstacle. Mental endurance keeps us focused and concentrated over time. It helps us, for instance, to power through the times when we’d rather quit but shouldn’t, like when we’re reading those hopelessly boring (but necessary) reports at work. Spiritual strength helps us stay connected to our deepest values, which act as our life’s compass. For example, spiritual energy is involved when considering whether a decision we make, such as accepting a high-paying job with an unethical company, is congruent with our values and morals. In order to perform at our peak and feel our very best, we must maximize each of these energy levels, especially the physical and emotional ones. In fact, physical and emotional energy are our most fundamental sources of energy: without either, we would simply be too exhausted and deflated to accomplish anything. Imagine, for example, that you’re about to undergo heart surgery: where do you want your surgeon’s energy levels? If he is emotionally and physically exhausted, then he’ll be unfocused, prone to mistakes and in even incapable of making the right decisions in complicated situations – thus putting your life in imminent peril. But it’s not enough to know that energy is important; you also have to put that knowledge to good use. The next few blinks will show you exactly how to maximize your energy. Unfortunately, our energy reserves are not unlimited, and we tend to expend more energy per day than we recover, which eventually results in a burnout. In fact, recovery is an integral part of sustaining high levels of energy and thus high performance. Indeed, all organisms must recharge their batteries by following life-sustaining rhythms, i.e., patterns of behavior that help them stay alive and kicking. For humans, this includes the need to rest every 90 to 120 minutes. If we, however, override this natural cycle and work past the point when we need to rest, then we’ll constantly flood our bodies with stress hormones, which, over time, cause aggressiveness and impatience, and can even lead to heart attacks. So, if we want to live a happy and productive life, we need to learn to heed our life-sustaining rhythm and disengage at regular intervals. At work, this means taking a relaxing break every 1.5 hours or so by doing things like having a coffee or taking a leisurely stroll through a nearby park for fifteen minutes. In addition to preserving the energy in our reserves, we can also build up our energy levels by taking small steps outside our comfort zones. Just like training muscles, which we build up by stressing them beyond their normal levels, we can also expand our emotional, mental and spiritual energy capacity. We can train our energetic muscles the same way: by simply pushing them beyond our comfort zone and enduring short-term discomfort. For example, someone who suffers from constant negative thoughts (resulting from negative emotional energy) could write down his thoughts every morning right after getting up and then force himself to read through them. The resulting discomfort causes him to further reflect on his thoughts and view his struggles as challenges rather than problems. In doing so, he “trains” and strengthens his emotional energy. It’s obvious that without the physical energy required to move or think, we wouldn’t get much done. In fact, our physical energy is our most important fuel. If we want reach our potential, then we have to maximize our physical energy. But how? Our physical energy capacity is dependent upon how we eat, sleep and recover. Since the fundamental source of our physical energy comes from food, we should therefore look for foods that maximize our energy capacity, such as nuts, leafy green vegetables and yogurt. These foods provide the slow release of energy to our bodies, thus providing us with more sustainable energy. Drinking enough water is equally as important – in fact, muscles dehydrated by only 3 percent lose around 10 percent of their strength! Additionally, we need to recharge our batteries with regular rest. You’ve probably noticed that the longer you work into the night, the more mistakes you tend to make. That’s due to declining physical energy levels. So how long do we need to rest? One study measured the amount of sleep its subjects got in complete isolation, away from their watches and alarm clocks. They slept between seven and eight hours every night, which we can take to be the optimum amount of sleep. But maintaining high physical energy levels doesn’t just improve our physical performance: it also helps us perform mentally. In fact, various studies have verified that people who work out regularly show a marked improvement of up to 70 percent in their ability to handle complex decisions! It’s therefore crucial to maintain physical health. This doesn’t necessarily mean we have to hit the gym every day. Even just incorporating small exercises into our everyday lives will do, such as taking the stairs instead of escalators and elevators or walking just a little bit further than the nearest restaurant on our lunch break. Even by making a few minor changes to our lifestyle, we can set a foundation of physical health upon which we can increase our other energy capacities. When was the last time you did something simply because you enjoyed it, and not because you were obligated to? In a frantic effort to maximize our time, we tend to choose “useful” activities over “enjoyable” ones. As we will see, prioritizing work over play can have powerful negative consequences. That’s because we derive positive emotional energy from doing things we enjoy and find relaxing. In fact, it’s positive emotions, like enjoyment, feeling challenged, experiencing adventure and seeing opportunities, which fuel performance. Activities that inspire these emotions are enjoyable and fulfilling, and thus a source of emotional renewal, which helps us replenish our emotional energy. It’s therefore important for us to actually prioritize these kinds of enjoyable activities over ones that are supposedly “more productive.” For example, imagine that your boss comes rushing into your office with some extra report that has to be done right away. That will probably stress you out and lead to high negative energy which hampers your performance. So what do you do? You have to figure out an emotional renewal strategy: any activity that you find fulfilling and captivating and helps you to relax, e.g., taking a stroll around the block or reading a novel to take your mind off work. Afterwards, you’ll have the energy available to complete the report. In addition, we can avoid negative emotional energy by maintaining high levels of physical energy. That’s because our bodies raise our stress levels, and in turn our negative energy, whenever we’re low on physical energy. That’s why people tend to get grumpy and short-tempered when they haven’t eaten all day or gotten enough sleep. So, in order to sustain positive emotional energy, we should remember never to neglect our bodies, and always get enough food and rest! In order to compete in this ever-changing world, we need to be creative while maintaining as much efficiency and focus as possible. Counterintuitively, the harder we try to achieve all this at once, the less of each we seem to have. So how can we balance them all? The key lies in using your mental energy. First, we need to find ways to focus most efficiently on our work. Doing so means adopting realistic optimism, i.e., viewing the world “as it is” while simultaneously working positively toward our desired outcome. Realistic optimism helps us keep our sights on the target, even when things go awry. Imagine you feel like you’ve jeopardized your relationship with a customer by saying the wrong thing. Rather than getting upset or ignoring the feeling, you should first accept the situation and then find the positive aspects in it: remind yourself, for example, that the relationship is not finished and that you have an opportunity to learn from this mistake. Once you’re able to keep your focus through realistic optimism, you can set your sights on boosting your creativity. Consider this: our greatest ideas often come to us when we’re not actually working, for example, while we’re in the shower, when we’re falling asleep, painting a landscape, etc. Why? Creativity requires the work of the brain’s two hemispheres: the left hemisphere is used for logical, linear thinking, and the right is more visual and can see “the big picture.” At work, we overwork our left hemisphere by constantly carrying out mundane tasks while neglecting the visually stimulated right hemisphere. However, once we relax or do something enjoyable, our left hemisphere has a chance to rest while we work our right hemisphere. If we want to unlock our creative potential, we need to give both hemispheres a workout without over-exerting either, and thereby employ all our creative capacity. While most of us don’t consider ourselves spiritual, we nonetheless all have spiritual energy. Spirituality doesn’t necessarily mean adhering to a particular religion but describes a commitment to a set of personal values that give us purpose as individuals and so compel us to act. Indeed, spiritual energy is very important and provides us with our drive and motivation. But where does it originate? Developing spiritual energy requires us to be motivated by something beyond our immediate self-interest – often, this means thinking about the needs and wants of others. However, we often only act based on our immediate needs and desires, doing things because they provide us with immediate gratification. All too often, we don’t stop to consider whether these actions ultimately prevent us from living at our full potential. A perfect example of this is smoking cigarettes. Many smokers have an extremely difficult time quitting in spite of the obvious risk to their health, focusing first on the immediate desire for a smoke rather than their future well-being. In order to change this destructive behavior, we need to find a source of motivation beyond our self-interest, i.e., a purpose in life that helps us to act positively. Looking back to the smoker: although kicking the habit can be excruciating under normal circumstances, smokers who become pregnant find it much easier to quit. Why? Because they have the health of their child to think about. In other words, they have a source of motivation (or spiritual energy) that compels them to act more positively outside of their own self-interest. In order to maximize our spiritual energy, we need to find a way to balance our guiding purpose beyond our self-interest with our own goals and desires. In the next two blinks, we’ll see how to find our true purpose and how to connect with our values. The search for meaning is among the most powerful themes across all the world’s cultures. As we saw in the last blink, a sense of purpose is the motivation behind our engagement and commitment to what we do. But what constitutes a “good” purpose? First, your purpose must be positive. Purpose serves as a powerful and enduring source of energy as long as its focus is positive. A purpose fueled by the feeling of threat or deficit limits our choices for action. For example, imagine sitting in a leaking boat: your purpose, of course, is to keep the boat from sinking. But if you’re only focused on bailing out water, then there’s no way to navigate towards the shore! However, if we shift our purpose from being built around feeling threatened to feeling challenged, then we are able to set our sights on something more worthwhile. Second, our purpose has to be intrinsically motivating. We need to want to do something because the activity itself is fun or satisfying for us. In fact, external rewards, such as money and fame, can actually undermine our motivation. This was exemplified in one study where children were observed while playing as a way to assess what they most enjoyed doing. Surprisingly, when they were rewarded each time they engaged in their preferred activity, their interest in that activity suddenly – and rapidly – diminished. Finally, as mentioned previously, our sense of purpose must be rooted in something beyond mere self-interest. The challenge, however, is to find a way to express our deepest values during the normal working day. Often we can insert our values into the small choices we make, such as how we communicate with our coworkers or lead our subordinates. For example, if you value “respecting others,” then avoid making your coworkers feel unappreciated by doing things like rescheduling personal meetings at the last minute. By doing this, you keep your actions calibrated to your values, and move one step closer on the path to full engagement. Sure, social status or how many Facebook “likes” we get every day might be important to us, but values that really matter have an intrinsic worth. They provide us with a source of our life’s meaning, which can’t be taken away from us, regardless of whether someone “de-friends” us. Our values provide the framework for how we would like to behave. If you want to find out what your personal values are, ask yourself what matters most to you. To give an example, one of the authors’ clients identified the following values: family, respect and kindness towards others, excellence, integrity, and health. Another strategy is to reflect on someone you deeply respect and ask yourself: What are the qualities you most admire about him or her? Those can be your values. Our values should ultimately serve as guideposts for every action we take and decision we make. When our values don’t guide our choices, the values themselves are meaningless. For example, if one of your values is “honesty,” yet you cheat on your partner, you must honor your value by telling him or her about your affair or your feelings. Otherwise, you couldn’t truly say that you’re guided by honesty. You should therefore aim to achieve spiritual alignment, i.e., the point at which you truly “walk the walk” and your values are evident in every aspect of your life. One way to help us towards this goal is to remind ourselves of our values every day by formulating them as a vision statement that tells us how to invest our energy such that we serve our values. Here’s one example of a vision statement provided by the authors: “I fight passionately for what I believe, but remain open to learning and growing. At work, I am committed to helping people grow, deepen and behave more effectively in the world.” By creating a vision statement, you have a clear way of knowing whether your actions are congruent with your values, and can thus better manage your spiritual energy. While it’s true that we require positive energy on the path to full engagement, we should not take this to mean that we should deny or suppress our negative feelings. Instead, we should strive to consciously manage them. Understandably, many of us tend to avoid the truth at times in order to protect ourselves from the pain of negative emotions. In the long run, however, this can actually decrease our energy levels. For example, if we receive negative feedback on the work we’ve done, many of us choose to ignore or dismiss this criticism as simply “wrong” rather than actually looking into the criticism for any insights that might help us improve. In fact, avoiding the truth in this way consumes a lot of energy due to the mental effort it requires. Although ignoring criticism protects your self-esteem in the short-term, in the long-term you’ll be destined to repeat the same mistakes and therefore have to face criticism every time you submit your work. Therefore, whenever you force yourself to ignore criticism, you squander your precious energy. On the other hand, being honest with ourselves and open to improvement helps us build positive energy. Often, this is difficult because people believe that the way they see a situation is the “absolute truth,” thus preventing themselves from accepting criticism. Instead, we should accept that our viewpoint is only one of many and might not necessarily be the best. Adopting this approach allows us to learn from others and improve ourselves. Being honest with ourselves also means accepting self-criticism. Ask yourself how closely your behavior correlates to your values and how consistent you are with your priorities, and don’t be afraid to give honest answers! If you identify a performance barrier, such as a bad work/life balance or a poor attitude towards your work, then admit it so that you can figure out how to overcome it. People often consider “rituals” to be relics of a lost time – certainly not something relevant to our flexible, ever-changing modern lives. Not so! Rituals are positive, consciously acquired behaviors that we perform without thinking, thus saving energy and time. In fact, most of our actions are driven by rituals, thus helping us perform more efficiently. According to research, only about 5 percent of our behavior is consciously performed, meaning that 95 percent of our actions occur automatically, out of habit. Try as we might, we cannot discipline ourselves to always act consciously; the toll self-control exacts from our energy is simply too high. Rituals therefore allow us to balance our energy expenditure and renewal – they allow us to act without thinking, even in the most stressful of situations. Think of it like soldiers preparing for combat: the recruits build rituals around every aspect of their lives, from what they eat to how to think and act under pressure. This code of conduct allows them to automatically make the right decision, even in life-threatening situations. But rituals don’t only conserve energy: designing positive rituals helps us to live in accordance with our values and perform at our very best. But how can we form these rituals? One way is to use a technique called priming: every time you’re tempted by something “bad,” do something “good” instead. For example, if you’re trying to give up sweets, then every time you feel the temptation to eat a piece of cake, tell yourself “Whenever I’m tempted by dessert, I’ll have some fruit instead.” Over time, you’ll form a habit of eating fruit and not dessert, which is far more efficient than consciously forcing yourself to stay out of the kitchen every time you face temptation. Moreover, rituals must be trained by carefully pushing beyond our comfort zones: start by building rituals in increments, focusing on one lifestyle change at a time, and then build upon that improvement with new rituals.

That’s why the author spent a year trying every productivity technique under the sun. These blinks look at techniques, methods and ways of thinking that are sure to help you in your own productivity project. They might seem simple but, as you’ll soon find out, less is more. You’ll also learn what three things you need to be productive; how working more hours makes you less productive; and what a brain dump is, and why you should do it. Some people think productivity is about doing more. They’re wrong! In fact, productivity is about working smarter and getting the important things done. Let’s look at two extremes of the working spectrum: a frantic Wall Street trader and a Buddhist monk. Ideally, what you want to find is the perfect meeting place between these two. The prototypical stock trader works at such a frenzied pace that his intentions become scattered and he fails to see the meaning and value of his work. Meanwhile, the monk takes the time each day to meditate and reflect upon what’s meaningful, yet he works at such a deliberate place that he doesn’t accomplish very much. So, it’s only when you position yourself between the rhythms of the monk and the Wall Street trader that you find true productivity. This ideal working pace is deliberate enough to identify what’s important and purposeful enough to accomplish your goals. To find this perfect pace, you need to manage your time, attention and energy. After all, you can have all the energy in the world, but it won’t accomplish much without a well-managed schedule. And the opposite holds true as well: you might have a perfectly structured plan to finish your dream project, but it’s useless if you’re wasting all your energy elsewhere. However, both time and energy can be wasted if your mind is constantly wandering and unfocused, which is why attention is the third key to the productivity puzzle. In the blinks ahead, we’ll explore a number of techniques that will help you strike the perfect balance between your inner monk and Wall Street trader, so that you can be the most productive version of yourself. So, what’s the first step to being more productive? Well, before you do anything, you need to find your purpose and motivation. They’ll help you create the right routines that keep you on pace toward your goals. If you try to skip this step, there’s a good chance you’ll establish bad habits and poor routines that will work against you in the long run. The author made this mistake when he first set out to become more productive. He set a 9:30 p.m. bedtime so that he could wake up at 5:30 a.m. every morning. With this schedule, he figured he’d have more time to do things before work, like get to the gym, do some reading, eat breakfast and plan the day ahead. This went on for months before he realized he didn’t care for this routine. It dawned on him that he was just performing his morning ritual so that others would think he was accomplishing a lot – but there was no personal satisfaction in his efforts. In other words, he hadn't thought about the purpose of being more productive, which made it impossible to create routines that matched this goal. You can avoid this kind of mistake by asking yourself an important question: if you were given two additional hours to your day, what would you do with this extra time? The answer should point you in the direction of the true purpose behind your desire for greater productivity. Would you spend more time with friends and family? If so, perhaps you’re most strongly motivated by the values of community and personal connections. And, if this is the case, you probably won’t benefit from a routine that keeps you away from an active social life. So, your first step is to consider your reason for wanting to be more productive to begin with. Ask yourself, what’s important and meaningful? Your answers to these questions are central to sustaining a good routine and becoming more productive. See if this sounds familiar: you wake up with a crystal-clear plan of what you want to get done during the day, only to have your plan fall to pieces by the time you check your first email. Thankfully, there’s the Rule of 3, which can help you make more attainable goals. The Rule of 3 was introduced by J.D. Meier, a Microsoft executive who explains how it works in his book, Getting Results the Agile Way. Basically, you should start every week by identifying three things to accomplish that week. Then, you should start every workday by identifying three goals you want to accomplish by the time you go to sleep. It might sound simple, but that’s part of why it’s so effective. By looking ahead at what you want to have accomplished both day by day and week by week, you’re already figuring out how best to structure your time, attention and energy on what’s important. So let’s say your end-of-the-week goals are to finish the first section of your book, update your website with new content and renew your passport. With these goals in place, your end-of-the-day goals might be to finish the next chapter of the book you’re working on, decide upon the topic for your next blog post and fill out the passport renewal form. When you’re setting these goals, check your calendar. To prevent yourself from choosing goals that are too ambitious or unrealistic, you need to consult your calendar to make sure you haven’t already dedicated your time and energy to another task. For example, even though you want to finish that section of your book, if your calendar reminds you of a big presentation you’re scheduled to give on Friday, it may be best to focus on preparing for that instead. Remember, being productive also means being smart about your schedule, so don’t set yourself up for failure by setting unattainable goals. According to a 2014 survey conducted by Salary.com, 31 percent of respondents spent at least an hour a day procrastinating and 26 percent spent two hours or more. So why is procrastination so hard to overcome? Part of the problem is the specific attributes of some tasks that make them so unappealing. According to Timothy Pychyl, a professor of psychology at Ottawa’s Carleton University, there are six attributes that will make procrastination more likely: boring, frustrating, difficult, unstructured or ambiguous, lacking in personal meaning and lacking in intrinsic rewards. The more of these attributes a task has, the more likely it is that you’ll procrastinate. This is why so many of us put off doing our taxes every year until the very last minute, since catching up on a television show is much more appealing. Therefore, the secret to getting around this problem is to make those unappealing tasks appear more attractive. You can think of it as giving a troubling task a makeover. Let’s say tax day is approaching, but you would still rather get a root canal than fill out those forms. Well, who says it has to be boring and tedious? What if you grabbed a table at your favorite cafe, sat down with a tasty beverage and were able to get in some enjoyable people watching while taking care of business? And if you feel like a task is lacking in any tangible reward, why not create your own reward system? You can pay yourself an hourly rate for the time it takes to finish the task, and by the end you can treat yourself to a gift that you’ve always wanted to buy. For most people, working more equals getting more done. But things are never that simple, especially when you consider that our energy reserves are not unlimited. So, to make the most of your time, you need to take control of your schedule such that you are using your energy and attention as best you can. There is no perfect equation that can tell you exactly how much work you’ll get done during any given hour. So, the author conducted an experiment to find out how many hours per week produced the best results. After testing out everything from a 20-hour to a 90-hour workweek, the author found he actually accomplished more or less the same amount of work across the board. As it turns out, the amount of energy and attention you exert is directly related to the amount of time you have. Therefore, he found himself exerting less energy and attention during a 90-hour week, but remained focused and energetic during a 20-hour week in order to get his tasks done on time. So it makes sense that the ideal amount of time would be in between these two extremes, at around 35 to 40 hours per week. Anything past this amount will start to negatively affect your productivity. In 2012, the journalist Sara Robinson compiled 150 years of research to show that when we work beyond 60 hours, any task will take twice as long to accomplish than it otherwise would. So, if something takes a person with a 30-hour workweek an hour to finish, someone who has surpassed the 60-hour mark in their workweek would need two hours to finish the same task. In a similar article published by journalist Bob Sullivan in 2015, he highlights a Stanford University study that shows how productivity takes a nosedive once a worker crosses the 55-hour mark in a workweek. It clearly shows that someone working a 70-hour week won’t accomplish anything more with their extra 15 hours. It all adds up to suggest that working 35 to 40 hours a week is an ideal schedule for optimal energy and concentration. Writing out a list is a deceptively simple act. It doesn’t take much to jot down a few items on a piece of paper, but it can make a big difference to our overburdened brain. You’ve probably experienced the feeling of not bothering to write a shopping list and then drawing a blank once you're surrounded by all the options at the supermarket. Our brain simply isn’t made for storing information in this fashion, so sometimes you need to help it out by freeing up space. This applies to productivity and completing those tasks, as well. You can free up valuable space and get yourself thinking sharper and more clearly by performing a brain dump and writing things down. A brain dump is a way of externalizing everything your brain is struggling to hold onto so that it can focus on doing what it’s really built for: solving problems and coming up with new ideas. So, at the beginning of your workweek and each day, do yourself a favor and write down these tasks so that you don’t need to waste energy trying to keep track of what still needs to be done. This simple but helpful technique will give your brain the space it needs to help you take action and get things done. It’s not just grocery lists and tasks, either; you can free up brain space by writing down everything from unfinished projects you want to take care of to books you want to read or a brilliant idea you don’t want to forget. And if you don’t want to carry around a pen and paper, you can jot it down on a notebook app on your mobile device. Another way of freeing up some much-needed brain power is to tackle easy tasks right as they appear. Why bother writing something down or trying to remember it if you can take care of it right away? If there’s a book you need to get your hands on, order it right away if you can. The key message in this book: Being productive isn’t only about getting more things done – it’s about working smarter by finding ways to be efficient and make the most of your time. To do that you have to acknowledge what’s most important to you and only then take care of business in the most efficient way possible. Actionable advice: Up your productivity by avoiding distractions. If you want to be productive, you need as much of your attention as you can possibly muster. Unfortunately, there are plenty of distractions out there, ready to hijack your attention. Just think of your phone alerts whenever you have an incoming message or e-mail. It takes time to refocus every time you hear one, so do yourself and your productivity a favor by deactivating as many potential distractions as possible. Got feedback?

Moreover, most of us probably have a set of personal goals as well as a list of professional goals. But what we often don’t have are the tools and understanding to create a realistic and actionable plan that will get us from where we are today to our desired destination. This is where the science of Intelligent Achievement comes in. Author Isaiah Hankel presents three tools, Selective Focus, Creative Ownership and Pragmatic Growth, that are designed to get you from point A to point Z with focused determination. The practices related to these three tools will help you block out distractions, use your energy to its fullest and increase your creative productivity. At the end of these blinks, you’ll be on your way to tossing out your to-do lists and charting a practical route to making your dreams come true. In these blinks you’ll find out how many hours of productive energy you really have each day; the wrong way to say no; and how Walt Disney can help you with your productivity.\n If you spend your days interacting with a computer, there’s a good chance you’ve encountered those times when you just feel stuck, staring at your computer screen. The more you try to get unstuck, the less you feel able to make any decisions. This is due to the fact that, when your mind is exhausted, no amount of time or effort spent on contemplation can help. The key to avoiding this kind of exhaustion is to have mental energy, as this is what allows you to be enthusiastic and enjoy what’s going on in your professional and personal lives. But while it may be important, mental energy is also scarce and easily depleted. According to a 2007 study in the Harvard Business Review, the average person enjoys only two hours of peak mental focus every day, along with an additional five hours of relatively high mental focus. At all other times, there’s a good chance your mental focus will be relatively poor. So, how do we make sure our mental energy gets replenished each day? A 2012 study by medical researcher Taeko Sasai suggests that sufficient sleep is what’s needed for this to happen. But even then, with high mental energy and especially peak mental energy being such limited resources, it’s clear we need to treat each minute with care. And that’s where Selective Focus comes in. Selective Focus is about being careful and choosy about how you spend your energy, and the first rule is learning how to say no to certain things that are competing for your attention. After all, you can’t give your time and energy to everyone, no matter how politely they ask. Saying no doesn’t always come easily or naturally. Many of us were programmed as children to say yes to whatever our parents or our teachers asked of us. When you said yes growing up, you were probably rewarded with attention, praise or even a big, welcoming hug. But now that you’re an adult, there are rewards to saying no. Through analyzing over 80 studies that looked into the benefits of saying no, psychologist Martin Hagger found conclusive evidence that it not only helps people avoid wasteful and unproductive activity, it also helps them achieve their goals more efficiently. In the next blink, we’ll look at some more rules for applying Selective Focus. If you’re interested in mastering a new skill, you may have heard that it takes around 10,000 hours of practice. This may be true, but you can’t just pile on one consecutive hour of practice after another and expect to reap the rewards. Those hours need to be filled with Deliberate Practice, which is the second rule of Selective Focus. In 1993, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson used deliberate practice to illustrate the difference between average achievement and exceptional achievement. He found that it was the hours people spent on deliberate, high-quality practice that made the difference. More precisely, Ericsson found that while average achievers worked more hours overall, they would also engage in a lot of non-constructive practice over an entire day. Exceptional achievers, on the other hand, would only engage in deliberate practice, which might consist of one burst of concentrated energy in the morning and another one in the afternoon. This would add up to just three and a half hours of practice a day, but it was more effective than an entire day’s worth of meandering practice. One of the things that keeps us away from deliberate practice and continually engaged in non-constructive or unfocused activities is that we tend to find certain distractions pleasurable. Activities like checking email or tidying up your desk can trigger a dopamine release that makes these usually unproductive tasks seem more rewarding than the ones that are aligned with your long-term goals. While such activities may make you feel like you’re “keeping busy,” they can be highly counterproductive if you’re supposed to be preparing your business plan for that upcoming loan meeting. In fact, rather than keeping busy, it would be better to stop what you’re doing. That way you can think clearly and plan the next steps that will help you reach your goal. Be warned, though, that if you don’t “look busy,” someone may see this as an opportunity to dump work on you. This is why it’s important to protect your free time as well as your Deliberate Practice time. If you’re ever unsure about when to say yes or no to a task, ask yourself: Is this going to bring me closer to the goals I’ve set for myself? If not, then it’s probably best to say no. As the author knows from personal experience, getting a cancer diagnosis can send you searching for answers. He reached out to friends, doctors and therapists, asking everyone for their opinions on how best to fight the disease. While it’s natural to seek advice when things get tough, it’s also important to be selective in this regard as well, because the attitudes and opinions of others can be infectious and sometimes harmful. According to a 2010 study from the Proceedings of the Royal Society, being around someone with a positive attitude can improve your own outlook by 11 percent. However, being around someone with a negative attitude can make your own outlook more negative by a whopping 50 percent. If you don’t want that to happen, you have to be highly selective about the opinions to which you expose yourself, which is why this is the third rule of Selective Focus. This can make a big difference in your achievements, because if the people around you call your dreams unrealistic, or think you’ll never have the skills to achieve your goals, you’ll probably start thinking that there’s no point in even trying. So it’s best to keep such pessimists at a distance while surrounding yourself with an ambitious and upbeat crew. If that’s not reason enough to do so, consider the fact that negative influences can even be harmful to your brain. According to Stanford University biology professor Robert Sapolsky, studies have shown that after listening to 30 minutes of negative speech, the neuron cells located in the hippocampus begin dying. And this is the part of the brain related to problem-solving, so those are definitely neurons worth keeping! A study from 2013, published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, found similar results. After researchers asked people either to ignore or to listen to someone’s four-minute-long negative rant, they found that the “ignoring” participants were better than the listeners at subsequently solving thought and concentration exercises. In the next blink, we’ll move on to the second tool of intelligent achievement. The second tool of intelligent achievement is Creative Ownership, which is about freeing yourself up so that you’re working toward your own goals and no one else’s. One of the primary ways of achieving Creative Ownership is to produce and market your own content. Now, you may be thinking that that sounds great, but that whenever you try to write, the results aren’t so hot. If you have writer’s block, there’s a good chance it’s due to trying to write about something of which you have no experience. That’s why one of the best pieces of writing advice is to write about what you know. Try starting by simply writing about what happened to you yesterday. Then go a little deeper by detailing one or two childhood experiences that have stuck with you. When you start to get the hang of writing from your own experience, you can graduate to hearing stories from other people and trying to write those down, and over time you’ll be able to write comfortably about yourself and others. To help expand your creative side and really get production moving along, you can make use of the Disney method. Named, of course, after the animation pioneer Walt Disney, the Disney system was outlined in a 2015 study by University of Munich media studies professor Sarah Tausch, and it is aimed at helping both individuals and groups to boost their production. An important first step is to turn off the nagging inner editorial voice that says your ideas stink or that last sentence was terrible. You’re going to start off with a first draft, so feel free to write whatever comes to mind, regardless of how little sense it makes. When you move to the second draft, turn your inner editor back on, but only at partial strength. This draft should take the good sections from the first draft, the bits that do make sense, and expand on them in paragraphs that come together in a coherent way. Then there’s the third and final draft, in which you crank the inner editor to full power by streamlining your story, cutting repetitive bits and any parts that ruin the flow. After this draft you should have an engaging and well-formed text. So, first is overcoming writer's block by silencing your editor and letting the words flow freely and easily. Then you hone in and expand on the good ideas before finalizing and finessing your final draft. Eventually, you’ll regularly be able to produce creative content that is interesting and high-quality. In the quest for independent Creative Ownership, one of the most valuable assets to have is a loyal customer base. The question is, how do you gain customers when you’re just starting out? One great tool for getting customers’ attention is lead magnets. A lead is essentially customer information, so a lead magnet is something that attracts customers and compels them to give you their details. If you’re a writer, a good lead magnet might be a site where you post your first book chapter for free and potential customers can provide their email to be the first to know when the rest of the book is published. Let’s say you’re running your own lifestyle improvement business. A good lead magnet may be a blog that regularly provides general tips that show you’re an expert in your field and that you provide quality service. You can also use customer information collected through your blog to send people newsletters and updates when a new post is published. Lead magnets generally offer something of value for free, so in this department you should expect to operate at a loss, but keep in mind that leads may boost revenue in the long run, and can even add up to their own product. For example, all those tips on your blog can eventually be turned into a book. The eventual goal of writing a book can serve as good motivation to update your blog regularly. This is also important because your site’s ranking on Google depends on how often you add written content; the more content, the higher you’ll be ranked in search results. Google can also help you to figure out what customers like most about your business, which in turn can help you to pick the most effective lead magnets for new customers. Google Analytics and other website tools can show you which blog posts or web pages on your site are getting the most views. If you’re putting that book together, this can help you decide which articles to include. It’s also great to know which lifestyle tips people are most interested in, since you can then plan future articles that expand and follow-up on these topics. If you find that all of your popular articles are about one topic, this is a clear sign that you may have found a good niche. For example, if your audience is overwhelmingly interested in tips on how to become a successful businesswoman, then you can focus on such articles and end up with a book called Lifestyle Tips Every Businesswoman Needs to Know. A pragmatic outlook can be useful in many situations. After the author was given his cancer diagnosis, life quickly became stressful, and that’s when he realized that the way forward was to be pragmatic, and focus on small, doable actions that would improve his condition. A pragmatic outlook is not only good for your health, it can do wonders for your success as well, which is why the third tool of intelligent achievement is Pragmatic Growth. Pragmatic Growth is essentially about increasing your ability to be pragmatic. The hallmarks of being pragmatic are being proactive and relying on realistic plans – especially in emotionally charged situations. It’s also a great way to overcome self-doubt and thoughts like, “I’ll never be able to finish this.” In these moments, pragmatism can help you focus on small, doable tasks and get you back on track to reaching your goals. Studies also show that pragmatism is a good defense against stress. In research published in 2008, psychologist Francis Flynn found pragmatists in general to be happier and more emotionally stable than other people. During times of stress, their happiness levels didn’t decline steeply, as was noted in participants who lacked pragmatism. Other studies have also shown how a pragmatic approach can keep the tides of negativity at bay. According to psychologist Rick Hanson, everyone has a negativity bias, or a tendency to focus more on unpleasant things than pleasant ones. His study showed that our brains will immediately store negative information in our memories, whereas positive information requires at least 12 seconds of focused attention for it to be stored. This is why we tend to remember the person who didn’t hold the elevator door open for us, but quickly forget the kindness of the person who did. But once you know about the negativity bias, you can take pragmatic steps to correct it and keep it from interfering with your goals. A 2008 study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin shows that your negativity bias is likely to sabotage your success if you don’t take steps against it. You can set regular small tasks to help with this very purpose, like making sure not to dwell on bad moments, and not only recognizing good ones, but taking at least 12 seconds to appreciate them. How do you feel about to-do lists? Are they a useful tool for staying on top of things? Or are they a daily reminder of all the things you wanted to do but never got around to? Well, if you’re not a big fan of to-do lists, you may be happy to hear that part of Pragmatic Growth is about accepting that to-do lists are often a waste of time. The truth is, making lists rarely leads to the kind of direct action that moves you closer to your goals. In a 2012 study, biologist Mones Abu-Asab found that a big problem with most to-do lists is that they’re made up of unrelated and dissimilar tasks. Some might take a few minutes, while others might take weeks to complete. And since people like the satisfaction of ticking off a completed task, they’ll focus on small tasks, while bigger ones, like preparing your business plan, linger and die on the vine. Staying away from distracting to-do lists filled with small tasks once again comes down to saying no and staying focused on the work that will clearly get you closer to your goal. You can even set your default response to incoming requests to no. Or use the rule of three and only accept incoming requests if the person asks three times, since it probably means you’re the only one who can help. You’ll also find it helpful to say no in the right way. According to a 2012 study by Vanessa Patrick, making excuses while saying no won’t help you in the long run; stating clearly that you don’t want to take on a new task is empowering and shows that you have more important work to do. In the final blink, we’ll look at some common pitfalls to Pragmatic Growth that you can make yourself aware of and avoid. In his role at the helm of countless productivity workshops, the author has worked with thousands of people who’ve helped him identify eight pitfalls to pragmatic productivity. You can think of the tips to avoiding these pitfalls as the ultimate tool kit for keeping you on the road to Intelligent Achievement. The first pitfall is accepting gifts. As the saying goes, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, because chances are the person picking up the tab is looking for a favor. This doesn’t mean you need to be cynical and think everyone is selfish, but if you do get invited to lunch, it doesn’t hurt to question the motives and wonder whether it isn’t, say, just a ploy to get you to work overtime. In short: pay for your own lunch. The second pitfall is not having a morning routine. Having a regular morning routine is great for reducing the amount of mental energy you use, since you don’t have to make any decisions – everything can just go like clockwork. This means you’ll have more mental energy to spend on more important tasks later in the day. Third is the mistake of prioritizing busywork. Always focus on the big goals and taking the steps that get you there. Similarly, the fourth pitfall is prioritizing easy tasks over difficult ones. Don’t do it! Pitfall number five is to be overly reliant on the eight-hour workday. Remember, you only have five hours of high-level mental energy available. So it’s all about being efficient and focused during these hours while spending the rest of the time resting and recuperating. The sixth and seventh pitfalls are the ever-present distractions of smartphones and incoming email. Constantly checking social media, texts and email wastes mental energy. Avoid these pitfalls at all costs. The final pitfall is giving in to requests from others. Again, this is about becoming comfortable with saying that magical two-letter word: No. So there you have it: the three tools for Intelligent Achievement are Selective Focus, Creative Ownership and Pragmatic Growth. Now it’s time to apply these tools to your life and accelerate your career with smart, Deliberate Practice. The key message in these blinks: Intelligent Achievement is about attaining your goals with the use of smart, focused practices, and the tools for doing so are within anyone’s reach. Once you focus your attention on what’s truly important in reaching those goals, you can begin to filter out distractions, including people with distracting requests and negative attitudes. You can then become more independent, creative and productive with tools like the Disney method, and use lead magnets to help you gain customers. The final tool is to be more pragmatic by being aware of your negativity bias, and taking small, realistic steps that will add up to major life goals. Actionable advice: Hone your creative voice by listening to others. Finding a voice that connects with your audience is about combining your interests with things that resonate with the public. You can start doing this today by talking to your friends about a topic that interests you and seeing how they react. Maybe a different but closely related topic is more interesting to them? Take in this information, and try to write a new article that incorporates your views as well as those of your friends and target audience. Got feedback?

Rogelberg","summary":"Take a look around a typical office, and you may conclude that the modern employee attends meetings more than she actually works. Although meetings are taking up more and more of our working day, many of us simply aren’t seeing the benefits of this enormous time investment. All too often, meetings leave us feeling unengaged, unenlightened and deeply frustrated about the interruption of our work.  It doesn’t have to be this way. Though many organizations have resigned themselves to fruitless meetings, researcher and management consultant Steven G. Rogelberg hasn’t. By pulling from scientific research and analysis, Rogelberg shows how you can transform your meetings into invaluable tools for solving problems and making decisions. With a wealth of simple tips and techniques that you can implement tomorrow, these blinks provide a clear and concise guide to changing the way you meet forever. In these blinks, you’ll learn what really needs to go on your agenda; how music can help your meetings; and why the most creative meetings are silent. How much time do you spend in meetings? Whether it’s one-on-one with your manager or catching up with the whole department, many people would say far too much! In the United States, for example, 55 million workplace meetings happen a day. All these meetings are costing companies huge amounts of money and time.  It’s a fact that employees spend more and more of their workdays in meetings. The Harvard Business Review estimated that in 1976, American workers had eleven million meetings a day. That’s just one-fifth of the number of American meetings that currently take place. Indeed, research conducted by software company Lucid Meetings indicates that non-managerial staff now meet an average of eight times weekly. For managerial staff, that number is even higher at 12 times per week. And senior leaders like Executive Officers now spend the majority of their time in meetings. Indeed, one joint study by Harvard and Columbia University found that CEOs in Italy were spending 60 percent of their working day in meetings. Incredibly, this figure excluded time spent on conference calls!  Inevitably, all this time adds up to a big expense.  You can uncover just how much money each meeting costs your company by multiplying an attendee’s hourly wage by the number of hours the meeting took, and adding together the answer for each person who attended. But be prepared, because the answer may shock your finance department.  Xerox, a printing company, estimates that meetings between their 24,000 person development team cost the company over $100 million a year. And Elise Keith, co-founder of Lucid Meetings, estimates that across all workplaces in the United States, the US is spending $1.4 trillion on meetings a year – that’s around eight percent of the country’s annual GDP!  But is this time and money well spent? Evidence suggests that many workers don’t think so. A 2005 survey conducted by Microsoft asked 40,000 workers all over the world what they thought of meetings. Depressingly, 69 percent said their meetings were unproductive. In a survey by Clarizen of two thousand American workers, a shocking 50 percent of respondents said they would rather do any other unpleasant work activity than attend their weekly team update meeting!  Clearly, something is amiss with many of our office meetings, but how can we make them better? Let’s start by looking at how we lead meetings. How good are you at leading meetings? Unfortunately, if you’re anything like most people, you’re likely to overestimate your abilities. In the author’s own research, for example, he has discovered that those leading a meeting typically rate it more positively than the attendees. Another research insight might explain this finding – the more someone talks in a meeting, the more positive their impression of that meeting will be. And who does most of the talking in most meetings? That’s right – whoever’s leading them.  So to get a more realistic estimate of your abilities, you’ll need to ask the people who attend your meetings what they really think of them.  The company Weight Watchers uses touch screens located near meeting rooms to collect employee feedback. When attendees leave meetings, they anonymously rate them using an emoji scale. Weight Watchers then uses this feedback to determine where change is needed. Importantly, these touch screens are also used after an adjustment has been made to assess whether or not it had a positive impact. In one instance, Weight Watchers added whiteboards presenting the meeting agenda to conference rooms, and dissatisfaction decreased from 44 percent to just 16 percent.  Leaders themselves can take a step toward better meetings by adopting the mindset of servant leadership. A servant leader is one who strives to meet the needs of their team and unlock each member’s true potential. To become a servant leader yourself, try to adopt a “giving” mindset. This means purposefully helping other people and sharing knowledge whenever possible. During meetings, servant leaders take responsibility for ensuring things run as effectively as possible. They exercise excellent time management, pacing the meeting according to the demands of the agenda. They also notice when conversations stray from the topic at hand and work to refocus the discussion. The servant leader listens attentively to discern any latent concerns that attendees might have. If a concern is detected, the leader introduces it into the discussion. Lastly, the servant leader facilitates an atmosphere in which attendees feel comfortable enough to express their opinions and politely disagree with one another. This permissive atmosphere is achieved by actively encouraging debate, reminding people to keep their criticism constructive and preventing any one person from dominating the meeting. Unsurprisingly, expectations around meetings vary from country to country. In Latin America, for example, it’s fairly typical for meetings to begin much later than scheduled. But across all countries and cultures, there’s one aspect of meetings that seems universal – no matter their purpose, or the number of people involved, they typically take one hour. But blindly following this unwritten rule can lead to a lot of wasted time.  This is due to a phenomenon known as Parkinson’s Law, which dictates that the length of time needed to complete a task will expand or contract according to the time you have to do it.  The effects of Parkinson’s Law are well documented. In one study, college students were asked to solve a set of easy mathematical problems. However, they gave some students only the amount of time they actually needed to solve the problems and gave others more time than they needed. And just as Parkinson’s Law predicts, they found that the group with more time took longer to complete the problems. Many other groups have replicated these findings, including NASA scientists! With this in mind, try to shorten your next meeting by a few minutes and see if your discussion magically shrinks to fit the shorter time frame.  You can start getting a feel for how long your meeting should be by reflecting on your goals, how many people attend and how past meetings went. Once you’ve done that, don’t be afraid to come up with an unusual meeting time. You could take inspiration from research firm TINYpulse, for example, who begin their daily team meeting at precisely 8.48am. This quirky starting time intrigues people and, according to the company, attendees are never late! You could even choose to make your meetings very short – just fifteen minutes long. These meetings are known as huddles, and research is overwhelmingly positive about their capacity for boosting the performance of teams and individuals alike. The Obama administration, for example, used daily huddles, as do tech companies like Apple and Dell. Another famous fan of super brief meetings is Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, who insists that her meetings last no longer than ten minutes. Everyone likes an easy fix. In times gone by, traveling quack doctors made a fortune selling useless pills and potions that promised to cure every illness and ailment. Why did people buy them? Because they represented an easy solution to a problem. Unfortunately, when it comes to the world of meetings, there are plenty of business quacks promoting a similar cure-all – the meeting agenda.  And, just like those useless potions, an agenda alone won’t magically make your meetings better.  Several studies have failed to find any association between the presence of an agenda and the quality of the meeting as perceived by attendees. Interestingly, research conducted in 2003 by the Economist may shed light on why agendas are failing to boost meeting quality. The study focused on meetings between senior managers in multimillion-dollar companies. It found that in 50 percent of the organizations, meetings either used the same agenda each time or created a last-minute, ad hoc agenda. Evidence like this suggests that many agendas are thoughtlessly produced and relentlessly recycled. Luckily, there is a better way. In fact, agendas can be a valuable meeting tool. But for this to be the case, leaders need to get specific about what goes onto them.  Arguably, the most important items to include on any agenda are those that originate from the attendees themselves. Research shows that employees who contribute to a meeting are more likely to feel committed to both their team and the wider company. You can encourage this by ensuring that the items on the agenda are ones that actually matter to employees. A few days before the meeting, take the time to email attendees to ask them what topics they would like to include on the agenda.  Once you know this, you need to carefully plan the order in which topics will be discussed. A psychology study by Middle Tennessee State University found that items that were discussed early on in the meeting tended to receive the most time and deliberation, no matter how complex they were. Therefore, make sure you rank agenda items in order of importance, with the most essential at the very top. Did you know that the big office meeting is the slacker’s best friend? For those who want to sit back, relax and listen to other people talk, the get-together that’s full of attendees provides ample opportunity to hide. But if you want your team to get ahead, you need to cut those slackers out of your meeting by drastically reducing your invitation list.  Although intuition might tell us that meetings benefit from any additional brainpower in the room, science reveals that inviting extra attendees is actually counterproductive.  Why? Well, as meeting size increases, the likelihood of social loafing increases, too. This phenomenon describes the tendency of individuals to reduce their efforts and motivation when they work in a group. One study highlighted social loafing by measuring how much effort people playing tug of war expend. By putting a device on the rope that calculated force, the researchers found that those who tugged in groups of three expended 85 percent of their potential pulling ability, whereas those in a group of eight tugged with just 49 percent of their potential strength. So to make sure everyone pulls their weight in your next meeting, try keeping the numbers as low as possible. Moreover, even when attendees are doing their best to be productive, evidence suggests that being in a big meeting hinders their efforts. Just consider a recent study that looked at data from consulting firm Bain & Company. The researchers examined what happened to groups’ decision-making ability as the number of people involved grew. They found that if a group increased beyond seven members, each extra individual lowered the group’s ability to make an effective decision by a staggering 10 percent.  So, just how many people should you invite to your next meeting?  Luckily, one man might have found the answer. John Kello is a management consultant who has spent much of his career studying meetings. He concludes that seven attendees is the ideal number of people for decision-making. This is because, as group sizes get bigger, coordinating everyone becomes harder, so inefficiencies surrounding the process of decision-making are more likely to arise.  Some of the world’s best leaders seem to agree with Kello’s analysis. Steve Jobs, for example, was famous for his hatred of big meetings. When President Obama invited him to a high-profile gathering of tech leaders, Jobs turned him down. Why? He thought the meeting sounded too large to accomplish anything. The business world is littered with products that failed miserably. Remember Harley Davidson’s cologne, or lighter company Bic’s throwaway underwear? If you do, then you’d probably rather you didn’t. This raises the question – why do successful companies market products that are obviously doomed to fail? Remarkably, it seems the answer may have everything to do with bad meetings.  After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the launch of these ill-fated products and others like them, many business experts have concluded that bad decisions are made for one major reason – the people involved didn’t raise their concerns during meetings.  Evidence suggests that this withholding of important information is commonplace. Just consider a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, which challenged a group to decide on a particular topic. Before the group met, the researchers gave each of the participants information on this topic. Crucially, some of this information was shared with everyone, whereas other pieces of information were only shared with a single person. The experiment was designed so that if the participants each shared their unique piece of information, they could reach an optimal solution. But if they withheld their unique knowledge, and only shared the information that was known to all of them, they couldn’t reach this optimal solution.  The result? As we might have predicted, the attendees were much less likely to discuss the information that was unique to them than the common knowledge, and an optimal decision was not reached. This same experiment has been conducted more than 65 times. More often than not, the participants don’t arrive at the right solution.  In view of these findings, it’s clear that the traditional meeting is an inadequate format for soliciting attendees’ unique insights. Luckily, a technique called brainwriting may hold the answer. During a brainwriting session, each attendee anonymously writes their ideas down instead of verbally presenting them. This allows them to share their unique perspective or knowledge which, as we have seen, is all too often missing from traditional meetings. Afterward, the meeting leader collects these notes and privately reviews them.  Although this might sound simple, numerous studies comparing brainwriting formats to traditional meetings suggest it leads to a higher number of better quality ideas. One study, for example, found that brainwriting meetings generated more original ideas by a staggering 42 percent! So when it comes to meetings, it might be time to stop talking and get writing. You’ll probably know how emotionally draining a bad mood can be. As well as exhausting, negativity is contagious. Indeed, research suggests that if someone around us is in a bad mood, we are at risk of contracting their negativity. Not only that, but a bad mood also threatens to undermine the effectiveness of your meetings. In fact, creating a positive vibe during meetings is crucial to their success.  Researchers from St. Louis University, for example, found that groups in which people were in a good mood were better at performing creative tasks than groups in which members were in a negative or neutral mindset. Furthermore, they found that groups in a good mood enjoyed better engagement between members and were more likely to share and apply knowledge from all members. Another study examined footage of real meetings. They found that meetings that contained more jokes and laughter also had a more emotionally supportive atmosphere, held more constructive discussions and produced more innovative solutions to problems.  Unfortunately, many of us are primed to go into our meetings with a negative mindset.  This is because we interpret the meeting as a frustrating interruption from whatever important work we were doing before. With this in mind, it’s vital that the meeting leader creates a positive atmosphere as soon as attendees enter the meeting room. There are several ways to do this. Firstly, consider playing music in the meeting room when attendees first come in. Music will help mark a separation between attendees’ feelings of frustration about being interrupted and the meeting that is about to take place. You could even approach the first person to arrive, ask them who their favorite artists are and put their music on. Secondly, the author’s own research has found that providing tasty snacks during a meeting supports positivity. Lastly, consider providing some toys for people to play with during the meeting, such as play dough or small puzzles. Evidence from New York University’s Polytechnic School of Engineerings suggests that the sort of hand movements that these toys require promote lower stress levels, boost focus and redirect pent-up energy toward the task at hand. The key message in these blinks: The typical office meeting is too big and too unfocused to facilitate great teamwork. To whip your weekly meeting into shape, try making it shorter, more positive and less talkative. Don’t be afraid to prune your invitation list, and make sure you prioritize topics that are highly relevant to your attendees.  Actionable advice: Meetings and phones don’t mix. If you’re thinking of conducting your next meeting remotely, with all or some individuals phoning in, you might want to think again. In fact, attending meetings via telephone encourages people to reduce their efforts and contribute less. Because phone attendees are out of sight, and their voices may not be readily distinguishable from other remote attendees, they feel anonymous. And research shows that people are less likely to work hard anonymously. So instead of phoning it in, try to encourage those who cannot be there in person to attend the meeting via Skype or video call instead. Just being visible will give their motivation a sizeable boost.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But does any of that stuff really make you happier in life? In author James Wallman’s estimation, adding happiness to your life is less about the choices you make at work and more about the choices you make outside of work. Wallman has put together a checklist for how to make better choices about your free time, so that you’ll feel more fulfilled and start living a more meaningful life. His findings are the result of speaking to some of today’s leading researchers and bringing together studies from a variety of sources, including the London School of Economics, Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge and Cornell. Your time is one of the most valuable resources you have, because it is limited – and shrinking by the second. So why not use science to ensure you make the most of it? In these blinks you’ll find out how you should be the hero of your own story; why statistics say spending time close to water makes you happier; and what the peak-end rule is and what it tells us about how to spend our time. It’s pretty common for concerns about free time to take a back seat to concerns about being more productive. Indeed, if you were raised in a capitalist society, you may think that time not spent earning money is time wasted. This might even be why we tend to idealize people who are always busy taking care of the next piece of business. Our desire to be efficient also explains why we tend to feel like we have less free time than we actually do. Studies have shown that the average American has five hours and fourteen minutes of free time per day, while the average Brit has five hours and forty-nine minutes. Yet other studies show that, despite these healthy sums, four out of five Americans feel they don’t have enough time to do what they’d like, while three out of four Brits feel they aren’t getting the most out of their time. But there are other reasons for feeling like we don’t have much free time. At the top of this list is the fact that people spend a daily average of three and a half hours interacting with their phones. This often comes from the fact that with so many emails, texts and social media updates arriving daily, there’s an anxiety-inducing fear of missing out on something – known as FOMO – which results in hours spent just keeping up with your digital life. But here’s the thing: even though we place a high value on work and productivity, they aren’t the only important things in life, especially when it comes to feeling happy and satisfied. According to multiple studies from institutions like Harvard Business School and Cornell University, what really brings happiness into people’s lives are experiences. While this is a pretty interesting idea on its own, research also shows that happiness is a strong precursor to success. Conventional wisdom usually tells us that happiness is a byproduct of success, and yet a lot of evidence suggests that it’s actually the other way around. What all of this adds up to is that positive experiences lead to happiness, which in turn leads to success. So to achieve success, we should try to have positive experiences. The question then becomes: What is a positive experience, and how can I introduce more of them into my life? This is precisely what we’ll find out in the blinks ahead. What kind of positive experiences lead to enduring, sustainable happiness? In researching this question the author came up with the STORIES checklist. This stands for Story, Transformation, Outside & Offline, Relationships, Intensity, Extraordinary, and Status & Significance. So when considering whether or not an activity is going to be a worthwhile way of spending your time, the first question you can ask yourself is: Will it add to my Story? Any valuable experience will add to your story by ticking off one or all of the items on the checklist. For example, if you, like the author, had an eye-opening experience while on a yoga retreat in India, that would count as transformational, intense, extraordinary and significant. Ultimately, experiences like this inform the kind of people we are, and they also form the narrative of our own life stories. There are two popular versions of all the heroic stories we find so satisfying. The first is called “The Man in a Hole Story,” introduced by the American writer Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. It suggests that every hero in a narrative starts out in a good place, then gradually sinks into a hole of misfortune before being restored to good fortune by the end of the story. The other version of this story is what scholar Joseph Campbell calls “The Hero’s Journey,” which is a more circular tale. It starts out in the ordinary world, where the hero accepts a “call to action” that requires perseverance through many trials and tribulations. Through this process, the hero learns new skills, overcomes the supreme ordeal, receives a reward and returns home. In the end, he shares the gifts and wisdom he acquired, and in doing so forever changes the ordinary world into a new world. By placing yourself in the hero’s role, you can not only recognize what your particular call to action is, but can also begin to be more adventurous and understand that difficulties and struggles are crucial to our stories and shouldn’t be avoided. It is through these challenging experiences that we acquire the tools that allow us to reach our goals and slay our own metaphorical dragons. But as we’ll see in the next blink, there are further reasons for becoming your own hero. Once you place yourself in your own hero’s journey, you can start to see that change – Transformation, on our checklist – is the name of the game. After all, if you were watching a story in which the hero wasn’t changing in some way, it would be pretty boring and maybe even sad, right? Well, the same holds true for your life, and it’s why change and personal development are key to feeling happier and more fulfilled. This is a good time to consider two simple but revealing questions: Looking back over the past ten years, how much do you think you’ve changed, on a scale of one to ten? Now, how much do you think you’ll change over the next ten years? For most people, the first number is higher than the second, and this is known in psychology as the end of history illusion, which means we tend to think of change as something happening in the past, not the future. As a result, significant changes are often unplanned. But once you understand that change is a key part of a fulfilling life, you can start actively seeking it out, by finding experiences that bring new inspiration, new skills and other transformative elements into your life. Let’s take vacationing, for instance. There are basically three ways you can approach a vacation: fly and flop, find and seek, or go and become. With fly and flop, personal development is not on the menu. Fly and flop might involve going to a resort and engaging in passive experiences like lying in the sun, eating familiar foods and reading books and magazines that require very little effort on your part. While it might be relaxing, this approach results in some pretty dull stories to tell others back home. Find and seek involves more active engagement. You travel to new places with the intent to explore, or maybe attend a music festival like Burning Man. You’ll see new things and have some interesting stories to tell, but for the most part it’s an experience that any other sightseer or concert-goer might have. The go and become approach, however, offers a real chance for transformation. In this scenario, your vacation would come with a purposeful intent to learn inspirational things about different cultures and customs, or new skills like painting, boating or traditional sushi techniques. Or it might involve a spiritual retreat of some kind. Whatever the case may be, it will include very personal, and possibly very transformational, experiences – and therefore a great story. Next on the STORIES checklist is Outside and Offline, which is pretty self-explanatory: valuable experiences that lead to happiness are more likely to take place in nature and away from the online world. Let’s first consider the benefits of nature. Around 1990, Japanese researchers began looking into the claims of health benefits surrounding a pastime known as shinrin yoku, or forest bathing – and, sure enough, the claims appeared to be valid. Compared to walks on a treadmill, these immersive forest walks were far more effective at reducing tension, anger and fatigue, as well as blood pressure and cortisol levels, while at the same time improving mood. There’s also the revealing evidence gleaned from the 20,000 or so users of the Mappiness app, who periodically entered their mood and activity while the app recorded GPS and weather data. Ultimately, the data showed that people were unhappiest while at work, sick in bed, or commuting to work, and that they were happiest while in nature – especially when close to water. Happiness levels in coastal areas, for instance, were generally six points higher than in urban areas. There’s a biological factor at work here. Scientists believe we’re simply predisposed, from an evolutionary perspective, to enjoy the calming sights, sounds and smells of nature and water. Biological factors also help explain why we should choose to spend more time offline. Researchers have long known that humans are susceptible to conditioning. You may be familiar with the psychologist Ivan Pavlov, who over a century ago conditioned dogs to salivate with hunger – not in the presence of food, but at the sound of a metronome that signified the arrival of food. Interaction with your smartphone is much like gambling on a slot machine: what’s at work is a system of operational conditioning known as intermittent variable rewards. This means you’re interacting with a system that offers an inconsistent promise of large or small rewards. And when this happens, even the most intelligent people can end up picking up their phones 300 times a day, checking how many likes their latest Instagram or Facebook post has racked up, or scouting for a funny new meme. The problem is that, as multiple studies in the US and Europe show, too much time online leads to feelings of isolation, stress, depression and insomnia. Fortunately, however, if you start spending less time online now, your mood can improve immediately. While solitude and some time alone can be a nice change of pace from time to time, no one enjoys feeling lonely. This might sound obvious enough, but what you may not know is just how dangerous loneliness can be. Over time, persistent loneliness has been proven to cause stress and create more protein fibrinogens in your body, which clog arteries, increase blood pressure and make you more likely to get diabetes and have a heart attack. What’s more, in compiling seven years’ worth of data from nearly three and a half million people, researchers found that loneliness increased a person’s chances of death by 29 percent. Meanwhile, social isolation increased that chance by 26 percent, and living alone by 32 percent. Remarkably, these statistics show that loneliness is deadlier than type 2 diabetes or smoking 15 cigarettes a day. This brings us to the third item on the STORIES checklist: Relationships. Curbing loneliness is about finding ways to connect with other people. And the good news is that there are many ways of doing this. Basically, the way to be less lonely is to do something interesting – anything, really. Most experiences involve other people in some way, whether you’re outside playing sports or indoors playing a board game. But even if you’re pursuing solitary experiences like meditating, reading an interesting book or working on a painting, psychologists have found that these activities can still provide a sense of belonging in the larger sense. And remember, whenever you have an interesting experience, it gives you a good story to tell, and sharing stories is one of the best ways to form bonds with others. Ideally, your experiences speak to who you are as an individual, so think about what you like to do, and then see whether there’s a group in your community or online that you can join. If you like to go hiking, there are plenty of outdoor groups; if you like to read, join a book club, or start your own. Check out what’s going on in your community. It’s highly likely that there’s a group or association doing something that you find interesting. If not, there may be a festival within a reasonable distance that you can attend. And when’s the last time you talked to your neighbors? No matter what you’re up to, there’s probably a way to make adjustments and find ways for your activities to connect you with others. There’s a good chance you’ve heard about flow, a state of being in which you’re so fully immersed in what you’re doing that you lose track of time. Studies have found that when we’re experiencing flow, we’re also experiencing some of the happiest moments in our lives. This brings us to the Intensity part of the checklist. After all, finding flow essentially means being so  intensely focused on what you’re doing that all your troubles recede. Needless to say, when it comes to deciding how to spend your time, choosing an experience that gives you flow is often the smart way to go. For starters, what you do should be challenging enough that staying engaged with the activity requires all your abilities and demands a state of full-body awareness. This is what athletes call the zone. Note that mindless video games, binge-watching and endlessly scrolling through a news feed are not sufficiently challenging activities. Even though they can cause you to block out everything around you and suck hours from your life, they’re not going to leave you with the kind of transformative satisfaction that you’ll get from good flow. A handy, simple rule of thumb for telling the difference between good and bad flow – or, as the author calls it, real flow and fake flow – is to know that good flow requires you to put in true, intense effort in order to receive the reward at the end. In fact, the progression of a real flow experience is not unlike the hero’s journey: there’s an initial struggle, followed by a release in which you enter the zone and the flow begins, and then, at the end, you feel physically, emotionally and mentally drained, yet also ecstatic at having slain your metaphorical dragons. Difficult experiences are thus not only worthwhile, they can be some of the happiest and most rewarding things you’ll ever do, if they’re intense and require your full engagement. And where can you find such experiences? Well, sports are great for adding flow to your life, but you can also get it from performing in front of an audience, writing, carpentry and any number of other activities that require skill and attention. For example, have you ever considered taking an improv comedy class? In the author’s experience, few activities are more intense than trying to be funny in front of a live audience. The penultimate item on the checklist for improving how you spend your time is Extraordinary. This, as the name suggests, stands for experiences that are out of the ordinary. But it also means paying attention to the peak moments that determine just how memorable an experience is. Peak moments, as well as endings, have a disproportionate amount of influence on how we experience things. In fact, psychologists have a term for this effect: the peak-end rule. Essentially, it means that you can wait in line for an annoying length of time, but if the line speeds up in the last moments, you’ll likely look back at the experience as not that annoying. In other words, even though the experience was mostly annoying, you’ll remember it as being pleasant enough because of how it ended, or how it peaked. The peak-end rule applies to a person’s experiencing self and remembering self, and knowing about this difference can allow you not only to make better decisions about how you spend your time, but also to plan those experiences better. For example, if you’re having a miserable time stuck in traffic on the way to a music festival, you can rest easy knowing that this is your experiencing self suffering, and that the peak moments of the festival will be the things your remembering self will care about, while the misery of the traffic will be forgotten. Now, this doesn’t mean you need to pack every day with as many peak moments as you can. After all, if it’s all extraordinary experiences all the time, you’ll likely burn out. Plus, it takes an ordinary baseline to make the extraordinary stand out. Since everyone’s needs and preferences are different, we all have to find the right balance that works for us. It’s also worth noting that you can inject a seemingly ordinary moment with extraordinary significance just by appreciating the inherent wonder in nature and human existence. Therefore, while it makes sense to add new and exciting experiences to your everyday life, you can also have a happier life by recognizing the everyday as already pretty special. Consider a cup of tea, for example. On its own it may be ordinary, but if you make each brew part of a daily calming ritual, it can be pretty extraordinary. All societies contain hierarchies of some sort, and wherever there’s a hierarchy, there are people of different status. In the workplace, for example, we have clerks, supervisors, managers and directors. But there are also two other primary ways for gaining status: there are the experts who gain status through their education, and successful people who’ve earned theirs through money. This is significant, since researchers have found that status can bring happiness, primarily through the added amount of control and number of options in life that come with it. According to a University of Cambridge study, three things can lead someone to flourish in life: control, capabilities and social participation. And the way you increase these three things is by attaining more education, money and power – the three elements of status. With more education comes more capabilities, and with more money comes a wider array of experiences to choose from. This equates to more opportunities and more chances for social engagement, which in turn can lead to increased happiness. As for the kinds of experiences that can contribute to more status in life, one of the best things you can do is continue your education in order to become more of an expert in your field. Travel is also a great way to gain more knowledge through transformative experiences as you visit more places, do new things and go on more adventures. As for social participation, this can be increased through any activity that helps you become more connected to your community, and a more important figure within it. This could include joining a local committee or just networking with more colleagues and peers. It also helps to do things that help you become more fit. But this isn’t about body image – it’s about being in better shape so that you can increase the range of physically demanding adventures and activities that are available to you. The final path to higher status is to turn off the TV. According to the author, it’s no coincidence that the lower someone’s status is, the more TV he or she watches. The more you watch, the fewer story-worthy experiences you’re having. So start thinking of TV as a last resort to turn to when all other options are unavailable. When it comes to the association between status and money, however, it’s important to understand that it’s not about how much you make, but how you use it. Happiness doesn’t come from buying interchangeable material things that anyone else can buy. It comes from using your money, as well as your time, to help others. The key message in these blinks: The STORIES checklist helps people add more fulfillment, meaning and happiness to their lives by focusing their attention on the seven key elements that make up the best experiences: Story, Transformation, Outside & Offline, Relationships, Intensity, Extraordinary, and Status & Significance. These are all characteristics that guide you toward experiences that further your personal development and increase your happiness, while keeping you away from empty activities that either add nothing of value or promote unhappiness.     Actionable advice: Go offline this weekend and get wild. Plan some outdoor activities for the weekend ahead, like hiking, canoeing or biking. Maybe pack a picnic and head out to the seaside, or set up camp in the nearest forest reserve or park. You could also just set up some long weekend lunches with friends. Whatever you decide to do, plan to turn off all your internet devices and leave them off from 7 PM on Friday until 7 PM on Sunday. Then make a note of how you feel during the weekend while you’re untethered. There’s a good chance you’ll feel some withdrawal-like symptoms, but see whether you can repeat this experiment at least one weekend a month while trying to move toward having more internet-free weekends.

On these days, it’s as if all of your time is spent checking emails, attending meetings, responding to questions from colleagues, and other seemingly trivial tasks that don’t really lead to progress. So what can you do to prevent these tasks from sucking the time and energy out of your days? These blinks present five strategies that will help you make sure that you don’t waste all of your time and mental energy on boring routines and futile decision making. They establish some simple conditions for your day, and will teach you how to be awesomely effective with your work. This way, you’ll ensure you have at least two hours of peak productivity every day. From these blinks you’ll learn   how to make the best out of a sudden interruption; why letting your mind wander can be good for your work; and that eating fat can make you work better. Over the course of each day, you engage in all manner of habitual tasks. Think about how many times in your life you’ve hopped out of bed, gotten dressed, scanned your emails and attended weekly meetings without a second thought. In these cases, we often switch off and go into automatic to get through our daily routines. Rarely do we stop to consider whether our routines make sense. It may be that your daily tasks are causing you to waste a great deal of time and energy without even realizing. Take Doug. As a consultant, he was required to write a monthly analysis report. But instead of completing this rather important task, Doug ended up tending his inbox instead, responding to a dozen emails in a trance-like state. Because sorting through his emails is part of his daily routine, Doug gave it preference over what should have been his real priority. Like Doug, many of us let routines get in the way of real productivity. So how can we change? By recognizing our decision points.  Decision points are those moments in times when a given task is completed or interrupted. At a decisions point, you have the opportunity to consciously choose what you do next. Let’s look at an example. Say a colleague comes to your desk and asks you to go to lunch with him. As a result, you’re interrupted in the middle of drafting a report. You then recognize that you’ve got a decisions point on your hands. You could either decline his offer and continue your work, or take a break and get a bite to eat. By consciously considering your options here, you’ll be better able to make a decision that benefits you and your productivity the most. As you become more aware of these points in time between tasks and make fewer impulsive decisions, you’ll be able to become more effective with your time. It’s rare to have just one task to do at a time. In order to keep all of our responsibilities fulfilled, we’re forced to juggle them. Should you sort through your emails? Or should you prepare for today’s meeting? It’s important to choose wisely, as you only have so much mental energy to use. Unfortunately, the juggling act itself can reduce the amount of mental energy available to us by causing mental fatigue. This happens when we overwork our executive functions, which are the parts of our brain that help us manage, regulate and control. If you switch off email alerts while you prepare for an upcoming meeting, you’re saved the hassle of constantly having to re-focus on the preparation, and you still have the energy to deal with a worthwhile task. Making several decisions, even those that seem unimportant or routine, can also deplete our mental energy more than we realize. Other activities commonly known to be mentally fatiguing are networking, switching back and forth between different tasks, project planning and scheduling. Obviously it’s not possible to avoid all the activities and tasks that might fatigue your mind, but if you remain aware of those that do, it will help you spend your mental energy on the tasks that matter most. Start by recognizing the tasks that tire you out the most, and refrain from performing them right before you need to give your best effort. If finishing an important report is the task that matters most that day, then don’t begin your day by responding to emails, like you usually do. Instead, start with the report immediately. We’ve all experienced the frustration of wanting to get work done, but finding ourselves constantly distracted by incoming emails, calls and notifications. It’s not easy to maintain focus, but there’s a good reason for that. Did you know that our brains are designed to get distracted? Consider our prehistoric ancestors: Do you think they would have been able to survive had they failed to shift focus from the berries they were picking to the saber-tooth that was creeping up behind them? Nope! Our brain has adapted to become distracted and refocus when changes occur in our surroundings. Distractions are perfectly natural. With that in mind, we’ll be better able to manage their negative impact on our work. Workspaces have several predictable sources of distraction – computers and smartphones being the biggest offenders. Even though we love and appreciate all that those devices can do for us, they also hinder our focus and productivity. That’s why turning off their distracting features, such as notification sounds and pop-up windows, is a great place to start. But what about unpredictable distractions, like an ambulance that passes by your window? Well, not all distractions are bad. We sometimes simply have to let our minds wander in order to boost our focus. Seems like a paradox, right? But there’s truth to it. A 2012 study from the University of California revealed that when we deal with tasks such as creative problem solving, our performance level will be enhanced if we let our mind wander once in a while. So how can you let your mind go without letting it drift off altogether? You can actively enable mind wandering by engaging in an unrelated and cognitively easy task – like tidying your desk or making lunch – after having focused on a difficult problem for a certain amount of time. You can also allow passive mind wandering, by letting yourself drift off, becoming aware that you’re distracted and returning to the task that needs your attention. Both approaches offer your brain the break that it needs to solve problems effectively. We all know that exercise is vital for good physical health. But if that’s not enough to motivate you, you might be interested in the positive effects it has on your mental performance, too. These effects were revealed in a study where participants were presented with color words written in a different shade of ink (for instance, “yellow” written in green). The participants then had to say either the color of the word (green) or what the written word was (yellow), before or after doing physical exercise. The participants who solved this task after the physical exercise gave correct answers faster, showing that physical exercise enhances the brain’s ability to make decisions and solve problems. Another study found that physical exercise sharpens your focus. Here, participants were required to aim at a target on a screen while ignoring distracting stimuli on either side of it. After doing physical exercise, participants demonstrated an enhanced ability to focus and to ignore distractions. Therefore, it might be a good idea to reserve some time to work on your important projects just after you’re back from the gym. But what if you have no time for exercise? Luckily, there are also certain foods that will increase your level of effectiveness too. Consider, for instance, carbohydrates and fats: Research shows that immediately after eating carbs, you’ll experience improvements in your ability to focus. But it’s short-lived, and other executive functions may decline after only one hour. Surprisingly, fats might be more helpful than carbs. One study showed that certain fats are likely to improve several executive functions – even three hours after eating. People who are dehydrated will experience more fatigue and difficulties with maintaining focus, so drinking water is also crucial if you want to lift your level of effectiveness. What goes on inside your body isn’t the only important factor for your productivity. What happens outside it in your immediate environment is crucial too! Find out more in the final blink. Are you one of those people who needs complete silence while working? Do you worry that music and background noise will sabotage your concentration? In fact, noise such as intermittent speech and music inhibits your ability to perform your best at work. Intermittent speech refers to words or sentences with pauses in between – basically, office chatter. Several studies have shown that intermittent speech negatively affects your ability to stay focused, read and process text. So, when you want to be effective with your work, closing the door to your office or reserving a conference room might be a good idea, so that you avoid that distracting chatter. Also, certain types of light actually boost your productivity. Both blue light and bright white light positively affect your ability to stay focused, and they can help you combat mental fatigue. A study in the United Kingdom exposed two nearly identical workspaces to different light: white and bluish white. The people in the workspace exposed to the bluish-white light reported improved concentration and work performance. But if you aren’t able to improve the light source in your workspace, there’s still one more factor that you can control to make a world of difference: clutter. All those notes, unfiled papers and free samples fight for your attention, and thereby decrease your ability to focus on your most important work. Being unable to move around is also detrimental to your productivity. If you’ve got room to get up and walk around every now and then, you’ll be surprised at how much you can sharpen your focus, and return to your work in a more effective mind-set than before. So, once you’ve finished these blinks, hop out of your chair and go for a stroll! When you return, you’ll be ready to start implementing the strategies you’ve learned to give yourself two awesome hours of productive, effective work. The key message in this book: You can harness at least two awesome hours of effectiveness every day by following five simple strategies: recognize your decision points; manage your mental energy; stop fighting distractions; leverage your mind–body connection; and make your workspace work for you. This way, you’ll provide yourself with the psychological and biological conditions you need for top performance. Actionable advice: Work it out! Next time you feel as if you’re having a brain meltdown, and your focus has left the building, step away from your desk. Exercise is what you need. And remember: the gym is not the only place where you can exercise. Be creative! Simply going for a walk in the area in which your office is located, or running up and down the stairs for a bit, will help you feel more mentally agile, focused and – last but not least – ready to take on the most important work of the day.

But the thing is, our memory betrays us, and we simply cannot remember her name. Perhaps you devise some ingenious way to get it out of her without asking her directly. Or maybe you’ll run into a friend of yours and introduce him to this woman, hoping that she’ll then introduce herself by name! Wouldn’t it be nice to finally put an end to forgetfulness? That’s where these blinks come in. In these blinks, you’ll learn why a pink tuxedo might be a good addition to your memory skills; how you can turn your boring morning commute into a memory bank; and what the sweetest sounding word is. Everyone wants to have excellent memory, right? But considering how many people find it hard to concentrate on details, remembering them just seems out of the question. There are ways to do it, though. Here are some top tips to improve your concentration. First, rid yourself of conflict – that is, anything that leads your mind in different directions and stops you from concentrating. Do you spend time switching between checking your e-mail and sending several messages on your phone? Well, that would make you like just about everyone else. But how do you get rid of internal conflict without doing something drastic like joining a monastery? A good starting point is to stop multitasking. According to neuroscience experts, multitasking actually slows you down by 50 percent and increases your chances of making a mistake by 50 percent. For example, chatting on the phone while driving will lead you to hit the brakes 0.5 seconds slower than normal. If you do the math, at 112 kilometers per hour, your car would need an additional 15.5 meters to come to a complete stop – and a lot can happen in that space, at that speed. Another smart move is to prevent your mind from wandering by giving yourself a purpose. That way, you can easily remind yourself why you wanted to concentrate on something in the first place. In this case, the PIC rule might come in handy: (P)urpose gives you a reason for learning. Take learning a programming language, for example. Your purpose there could be building a website for your family. Once you’ve found a purpose, ask yourself questions so you become (i)nterested and (c)urious about what you’ve chosen to learn. “Is this currently relevant to my life?” or “Can I use this at work?” are great ones to start with. So, now that you know how to improve your concentration, it’s time to discover how to retain information, too. Have you ever read a page of a book and then immediately forgot what you just read? Well, that never has to happen again. An easy way to remember a bit of information is to bring it to life, and this is all about using your creativity to make a memorable movie or picture. When it comes to words, there’s a lot to play around with. They can often be broken down into smaller words which sound similar to others – that way, you can make them more memorable by making them sound funny or absurd. This is great when it comes to memorizing foreign words or capital cities. Say you’re trying to learn “pollo,” the Spanish word for chicken. Picture yourself playing polo while riding on a massive chicken and you’ll never forget it again! Or, let’s take the capital of Australia, Canberra. If you’re trying to remember it, visualize a KANgaroo eating some BERRies to help jog your memory. It takes some practice to think in this way, but it makes the process of remembering things much easier. To make the pictures you’ve imagined super exciting, and therefore more memorable, just use the SEE method. Information always enters our brains via our (s)enses. So, for example, when you’re trying to remember the word “horse,” it’s important to imagine its skin, smell, touch and even its taste. That way, you’ve created a multisensory image that’s far easier to recall than five letters. Up next is (e)xaggeration. Compared to an ordinary horse, you’re more likely to remember a giant bright pink horse wearing a tux, right? Forget logic, it’s all about making funny, fantastical images. And lastly, (e)nergize. A horse galloping at full speed into the sunset is far more entertaining than one standing still in a stable. Adding a bit of action will make the information you’re trying to retain a lot more vivid. The key to remembering information, then, is to use your imagination to bring it to life. Now that you’ve discovered how to create memorable images, it’s important to learn how to organize them in your mind. The best way to do this is to use the loci method, also knows as the route method, which is the practice of combining new information with something already familiar. Humans are experts at remembering specific routes or places (just think about your commute to work), so most memory systems already make use of loci. It works by putting the items to be remembered at specific locations along a route that is already vivid and familiar in our minds. Here’s how you can put the loci method to work: Say you’re trying to memorize bits of a speech you have to give. You would imagine walking around your house along a particular route. The idea here is to create a string of locations to visit as you go. So, in each room you imaginarily venture to, pick three specific locations in the room, and put them in a specific order. In this way, as you go around your house, you combine each part of the speech with the locations you’ve picked. Let’s say you start in the kitchen and the first loci is your favorite pink breakfast bowl. You’d think of the horse in a pink tuxedo from the SEE method in the previous blink and remember that the word “horse” is in the first paragraph of the speech. To make it even more memorable, you could imagine spinning the pink breakfast bowl on its head! Next, let’s say the following paragraph in your speech includes the words “summer camp,” which you remember by imagining your family pictures on the refrigerator. This method is effective because it’ll work with any structured location that you know well. Whether it’s your car, your body or a museum, you can use your route to recall your list. If your route is intentionally structured to hold, say, five objects per room, then you’ll remember both the list and its exact order. And if you’re still not convinced, consider this: the author used this very method to remember the first 10,000 digits of the number π (pi)! It’s always remarkable when a person can easily recall complex mathematical facts or historical dates at the drop of a hat. If you want to be able to do the same, here’s a simple way to remember numbers that only requires three steps. The idea is to transform numbers into images that’ll stick in your mind. First, you’ll need to learn a system that changes numbers into letters or alters how those letters sound. Take the number zero, which can be represented by the letters s, z and c. Tough to remember? Think about a hissing wheel. After all, zero looks like a wheel anyway! Each number from zero to nine can be assigned a group of similar sounding consonants. For instance, the number six can be represented by the sounds j, sh/ch or a soft g. You can also use the shape of the numbers when you assign the sounds to make them easier to remember. For instance, if you flip the numbers two and three on the side they look like the letters N and M respectively and if you flip the number 9 horizontally or vertically, it looks like a p or a b. Vowels are left out for now, but come into use later. The next step in remembering a date or number is to write down the letters that represent them and make up a word. Say you want to remember the year 1969, when humans first walked on the moon. Most memorable dates happened in the last millennia, so you only need to remember the 969 bit. Therefore, the sounds b, sh and p should come to mind. Together, they can be used to make the word BiSHoP. The last stage is to make a picture for you to remember. Using the SEE principle, take the word you’ve created and your chosen date or number. For the above, a bishop dancing on the moon with Neil Armstrong should do the trick! Now that you know how this system can transform numbers into words, it should be simple to create memorable images that you can use to recall particular numbers or dates. Is there anything more embarrassing than forgetting a colleague’s name? Well, when it comes to memorizing this kind of information, just remember the four Cs: concentrate, create, connect and continuous use. If you use this handy system, you’ll never have to deal with this awkward situation again. First and foremost, you’ve got to concentrate on the person’s name if you want to remember and use it. Say the name out loud and then repeat it. If it’s a tricky one, just ask for the spelling. To help the name stick, pick it apart and use any words that come to mind to create a memorable image. Take, for example, the author’s surname: Horsley. To remember his name, you might picture a fight between a HORSe and Bruce LEE. Once you’ve sorted your image, connect it to the person’s face whose name you’re trying to remember. That way, seeing their face will immediately bring up their name. A great way to match a face to a name is to use the connection method. If the person has a striking feature, connect that to the name you’re trying to remember. If your colleague Janice has icy blue eyes, imagine icicles flying out of them! But what happens if you already know someone with that name? This is where the comparison method comes in. The key to this technique is to compare the new face to the one you know. Take two people with the name John. You could imagine both of their heads on one body, chatting to each other about how they look that day. Whichever method you use, make sure you revisit the names you’ve learned so that you use them continuously. It would also be handy to list the names in your diary or add the people whose names you’re trying to remember on your favorite social media channel. You’re now set to remember any information you want. In the final blink, you’ll learn how to make sure it all sticks in your mind. Do you remember much of what you learned at school? According to the author’s research, within two years of finishing school, people can only remember the equivalent of about three weeks’ worth of lessons from 12 years of daily classes. It’s no surprise, then, that without training your memory you’ll forget most of what you’ve learned. To put it simply, all this brain training is pointless without a review process to make it stick. But what’s the most effective way to do this? Each time you revisit what you’ve memorized, the information you’ve absorbed has more of an impact in your mind than it did before. Therefore, to really make sure your brain never forgets what you’ve learned, you should gradually leave more time between one review and the next. After learning something new, you should go over it after one day, then three days, then seven days later and so on. You should return to it two final times after you’ve had a two-month break and again following a subsequent three-month break. Another point to remember is that when you’re going through the process of reviewing, take advantage of the memory techniques you’ve learned. The SEE principle should have provided you with clear, vivid images to bring your information to life. Has the bishop still got moves on the moon? Make sure to use the tools you’ve got, otherwise you’ll lose what you’re trying to retain. It’s always a good idea to stay focused on your main goal, too. If you’re learning a foreign language, booking a trip to that country could be the motivation you need to study extra hard. When it comes to memorizing what you’ve already learned, the key is reviewing what you’ve done to prevent yourself from losing your newfound knowledge. The key message in this book: To make information memorable, you need to bring it to life. The best way to do this is to connect what you learn with what you already know, use your imagination to form memorable images and engage your senses. Finally, by reviewing what you’ve stored in your mind, you’ll make sure it’s never forgotten.  Actionable advice: Get off Facebook! Stay in the present by spending less time on social media apps – you’ll find it much easier to concentrate and learn new information with a clear mind. In no time, you’ll find that by using the memory techniques you’ve learned, you won’t even need to write down your weekly shopping list! Got feedback?

Hold for a count of two and then breathe out slowly.  Sound familiar? Many people associate meditation with a standard set of guiding words, usually intoned by some overly empathic pseudo guru. Others think that meditation enthusiasts have an irresistible urge to chant in public spaces and spend all their money on meditation retreats. Obviously, these are oversimplifications. Really, anyone can incorporate a meditative practice into their life, and that practice needn’t absorb an exorbitant amount of time or funds. These blinks show you what meditation is when you remove all the fluff, and why it can help recharge your batteries and reshape your brain for the better. From the six basic steps of a daily meditation practice to dealing with the intrusive thoughts that appear when you try to relax your mind, these blinks cover all the ground you need to unplug – today. You’ll also learn how an electric kettle by your bed might make you a better meditator; why imagining your breath as a train is beneficial; and how picking people off a tree is a type of meditation. For many, the word “meditation” conjures up images of long-haired hippies listening to new age music, sitting in rooms full of incense smoke and preaching about their vegan lifestyle. While you’re certainly welcome to go this route and buy all the crystals and incense you can get your hands on; meditation can also match any lifestyle. If you prefer a minimalistic approach to living, then you can approach meditation in a similar manner. In fact, there’s hardly anything more minimalistic than meditation, since all that’s required is stillness and focus. If you’re worried about your friends or roommates mistaking your practice for some newfound spirituality, you can always explain it as a way of improving your concentration. Chances are, even people who roll their eyes at the M-word will immediately recognize that feeling calm and thinking clearly is desirable for both work and personal life. Another misconception that often keeps people from meditating is that it takes up too much time. It’s true that you do have to set aside some time – but it doesn’t take much. The benefits will soon become apparent. According to Harvard neurologist Sara Lazar, your brain function will improve in just eight weeks if you spend 27 minutes each day in meditation. But even ten minutes a day will provide you with tremendous benefits, such as feeling calmer and more grounded. So there really isn’t any reason not to meditate. Even the busiest person can find at least five to ten free minutes a day. As you’ll see, it’s something you can do almost anywhere! Next, we’ll take a closer look at some of the amazing benefits. Imagine that your brain is a piece of clay, something you can mold and manipulate as you wish, strengthening the areas that are most important. In a way, meditation makes your brain clay-like; it allows you to reconfigure your gray matter and change the way your brain is structured. This has been proven by two studies conducted by the Harvard neurologist Sara Lazar. In each, she compared the brain structures of those who meditate to those who don’t. The results show that regular meditators have more gray matter in their frontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that controls memory and decision-making. The frontal cortex normally shrinks as we get older, but Lazar’s studies showed that this doesn’t happen with meditators. It revealed that 50-year-old meditators had as much gray matter as 25-year-olds who didn’t meditate. This suggests that meditation could be a great way to fight Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other old-age diseases, though further research needs to be done. Lazar’s second study shows that meditation can be quite beneficial to newcomers and that it’s never too late to start. Lazar got a group of people who had never meditated before, and for eight weeks straight they practiced meditation for 30 to 40 minutes every day. By the end, each participant showed changes in the areas of the brain related to learning, memory, concentration and emotion. And they all performed better than before in tasks related to those areas. But that’s not all. The results of Lazar’s research showed that meditation made her subjects happier. While the frontal cortex got bigger, the amygdala – the part of the brain responsible for feelings of stress, fear and anxiety – had gotten smaller. A separate study by the University of California, Davis has shown that people who meditate also have less cortisol, a hormone that accompanies stress. And naturally, people feel happier when there’s less stress, fear and anxiety in their lives. So there are plenty of reasons to start a meditation regimen. In the next blink, we’ll explore how exactly to do that. If you’re a morning person, it might be easiest for you to meditate first thing in the morning. The primary advantage to meditating right after you wake up is that the brain is still in its theta rhythm. In this state, we’re still tuned into our inner world, and our brain tissue is especially malleable. So it’s an ideal time to meditate and positively influence and shape the brain. The other great advantage to an early morning session is that you’ll have it accomplished and out of the way. If you try to schedule it later in the day, you’re sure to find yourself caught up in emails, commuting, work and errands, and before you know it, you’ll be telling yourself you’re too tired or busy to meditate. So it’s best to wake up, get it done and stay on schedule. But of course this isn’t a strict rule. If your lunch break or the time just before bed works better for you, go for it. As a beginner, a primary concern should be finding your comfort zone. Don’t worry about twisting your body into some sort of fancy position at this stage. This is the kind of thing that can end up scaring people away from meditation. Just try to sit comfortably with your spine in straight alignment, and if you need a cushion to get comfortable, don’t hesitate to use one. Many shops sell meditation cushions that will help you sit straight, but you can also use any comfortable chair or a folded blanket. Keep in mind that any comfortable position will do just fine, but it is best to keep your legs below your hips if you’re sitting; otherwise, they might fall asleep. And if you’d like to try meditating early in the morning but have trouble getting yourself out of bed, try putting an electric kettle next to your bed. Having a warm cup of tea within arm’s reach is a great way to coax yourself out from under the sheets. You’ll often hear meditators talk about their “ritual.” But don’t worry; ritual is just another word for routine, and no one is going to try to get you to dance under a full moon or anything. A good ritual often makes it easier for people to keep up their meditation practice. Humans are creatures of habit. And when you program your body to do something at a regular time, it becomes second nature, and you don’t have to muster up your motivation each time. Therefore, the first step to building a good meditation habit is finding a regular time for it. If you start meditating first thing in the morning, you can also have your meditation area prepared the night before. You can set up your cushion near your bed, along with any other inspirational objects that might facilitate your sessions, such as a candle or some music. These preparations are helpful in more ways than one; they communicate to your body and mind that this is your ritual, and you intend to meditate first thing in the morning. As you’ll discover, this preparation will make it much easier to get up and actually follow through. It’s also easier to meditate with a worry-free mind. When starting out, you’ll probably find your mind wandering off to what you have planned for the day or what groceries you need to pick up. To avoid this, follow the brain-drain practice from Julia Cameron’s book The Artist’s Way. Before you meditate, use pen and paper to jot down everything that is on your mind and anything that you need to remember for the day ahead. Now you can put the paper aside and rest easy knowing that your daily concerns won’t be neglected. Doing this will help clear your mind and prime it for a peaceful session. By now you’re probably thinking that this is all well and good, but you still don’t know what to do while meditating. So let’s get to it in the next blink. The world is full of programs built around a number of steps, like the 7-step weight loss program or the 12-step addiction recovery program. Similarly, to get your own meditation program going, we can break things down into six simple steps that you can repeat over and over again. The first step, once you’ve gotten yourself comfortable, is to find a point of focus. People often focus on their breath, as it flows in and out, in and out. But it could also be an object, like a flower or your favorite seashell. Or a particular phrase, often referred to as a mantra. The second step is to reach a point where you’re not focusing on anything at all. The third step is a period of time that can last anywhere from a second to a couple of hours where you are free of any thoughts and merely float in a sensation of peace. The fourth step begins when a thought enters and interrupts this peace, which can happen within seconds or after a prolonged period of absence. The fifth step is acknowledging the thought, letting it pass and bringing your attention back to that first point of focus. The sixth and final step is to continue repeating steps two through six for as long as your session lasts. Many people find a mantra to be of great help in finding and returning to that peaceful state of mind. Breathing isn’t always strong enough on its own, so a mantra – a repeated word or phrase that follows the rhythm of your inhalations and exhalations – can help. Generally, a mantra is not spoken aloud. Here are some classic mantras to get you started, broken down syllabically. Think of the first syllable as being on the in-breath, and the second syllable on the out-breath: Ah-hum / So-hum / I-am / Oh-mmmmm. You can also make your own mantra by coming up with an affirmation. So ask yourself, “How do I want to feel?” You might find it helpful to say: I-am / Peace-ful. It feels good when a tense muscle relaxes. The same goes for when we let go of a troubling and intrusive thought. But letting go of unwanted thoughts isn’t always easy, which is why meditation can be so helpful. One of the best ways to free oneself from bad thoughts is to redirect one’s attention. A common misconception is that you have to stop thinking in order to meditate. But as you’ll quickly find out, trying to stop any and all thoughts is easier said than done. The real secret is to let the thoughts pass by without engaging them. If you do find yourself engaging, just redirect your attention back to your focus point. This is meditation. Don’t get discouraged by thoughts appearing. It doesn’t matter how often you get distracted, just as long as you keep bringing yourself right back to your breathing or mantra. In this sense, meditation isn’t about having no thoughts; it’s about not being bothered by the thoughts you have. To help yourself let go of recurring and disturbing thoughts, you can try visualization. A helpful image is to picture your thoughts as leaves that have fallen into a river and are being carried away by the water. Or as clouds moving across the sky and disappearing out of sight. There’s no harm in observing or acknowledging your thoughts. In fact, this can be a helpful way of gaining insight into your thinking patterns and emotional issues. Just try not to engage with them. Let them pass by untouched, so to speak. Another helpful visualization is to see your thoughts as passengers on a train. Your breathing is the train itself, and even if the passengers are noisy, the constant rumble of the train is always there in the background, waiting for your attention to return. If you’re experiencing trouble or are unhappy with these traditional meditation methods, don’t give up. You have options. For instance, many people enjoy guided awareness meditation (GAM) as a nice change of pace from the usual routine. GAM is a way of adding more imagery to your standard meditation session, with the help of a guide. For example, after settling in, your guide might tell you to picture yourself lying on a tropical beach while your ideal life is being projected before you like a movie. Or the guide might suggest you imagine your life as a tree with many leaves, each leaf representing an aspect or a person in your life that you feel is a negative influence. In your imagination, you can pluck these leaves away without consequence. GAM follows the same six steps as traditional meditation. The only difference is that there’s a guide who, via visualization prompts, helps keep your focus off those unwanted thoughts. But this means that effective GAM requires a talented guide who can conjure the kind of vivid imagery that sparks your imagination and commands your attention. If you have trouble finding a good guide in your neighborhood, there a plenty of resources available online. Another variation that some find helpful is sound meditation. One of the more popular examples is the use of a Tibetan sound bowl, which you can place on your midsection while you lie on your back. Now you just follow the usual steps, but whenever you feel those unwanted thoughts approaching, you gently strike the bowl with a wooden hammer. This not only provides a strong focus point to keep you present; it also provides a beautiful sound and a vibration that moves through your body. At this point, you have enough knowledge to start a daily meditation session. In the final blink, we’ll take a look at some additional tools that might make it a bit more appealing. There is no shortage of thingamajigs, knickknacks and tchotchkes out there to assist in your meditative journey. So if you’re also a lover of retail therapy, welcome to a whole new world of opportunity. To go along with that Tibetan sound bowl, you could also consider aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is a way of supplementing your meditation with relaxing aromatics and scented oils that help calm the body and mind. Certain scents can strongly affect the nervous system and instantly trigger emotions related to relaxation and happiness. Lavender, for example, promotes relaxation, while orange extract is good for reducing stress and promoting happiness. Peppermint scent can be used to sharpen your senses, and rose oil is a good way to add some love to the air. Simply rub the essential oils between your palms, lift your hands toward your face and inhale. The scent of essential oils is strong, so a little goes a long way, but you may want to repeat this process a few times during your meditation. Crystals are another common addition to meditation. According to the author, they can bring a healing element to your session, and while they don’t have any magical powers, you can take advantage of the powerful frequencies they emit. This is the quality that makes them useful for laser and watch technologies. The author recommends that when searching for a crystal, you shouldn’t overthink it. Simply trust your instincts and pick whichever one appeals to you. Once you’ve brought it home, you can go online and read about the qualities your type of crystal possesses, and chances are you’ll understand why you were drawn to it. Some examples of potential benefits that the author mentions are that rose quartz helps in the area of love; amethysts can help soothe the body and mind; carnelian crystals promote happiness; and pyrite is good for career success. During meditation, you can hold your crystal in your hand, place it on your body while lying down or use it as the focus point of your meditation, noticing its unique shape, feel, texture and temperature. There are a great many tools to help you get the most out of meditation, but remember, the main thing is just to sit down and do it. The key message in this book: Meditation isn’t some weird spiritual practice; it’s a very practical tool to help promote a calmer, more focused and more productive life. And it doesn’t require any severe lifestyle changes. All it takes is ten minutes every day, and before long you’ll be noticing the rewards.  Actionable advice: Try this quick meditation when you’re feeling stressed. Take seven slow breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the nose. Then another seven slower breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. Then a final, very slow seven breaths, inhaling through the mouth and exhaling through the mouth.

Glei","summary":"Imagine if you had a neighbor who, in the grips of letter-mania, went outside and checked his mailbox every ten minutes. You’d probably be very concerned about this person’s mental health. But consider that, at work, most of us do the digital equivalent of this every day: we check our email inboxes again and again and again. These blinks reveal that email and similar services are ruining our productivity and flow. Luckily, as you’ll soon learn, we can stop being slaves to our inboxes. You’ll also discover why it’s so easy to misread the tone of someone’s email; what’s bad about checking your inbox first thing in the morning; and how to respond to an email if you have no time to respond. How many times per day do you stop to check your email? Do you try to avoid it altogether or are you one of those people who hits refresh again and again, waiting for the next message? Even if you know you’re a little obsessive, you may be more addicted than you think. Just consider this unsettling statistic: the average office worker checks their inbox 74 times a day. This isn’t because people are given a ten-minute deadline to reply; it’s because the very act of checking email is addictive. Perhaps you think that an inbox overflowing with unread emails is a daunting task waiting to be tackled. But that’s not exactly the case. Each of these unread messages holds out the promise of a pleasant surprise – of some interesting or fantastic news. So even if the thought of getting back on top of your post-weekend messages gives you the jim-jams, you’ll still be drawn to the task. We get addicted to the jolt of joy that some messages give us. Our addiction comes from a primal impulse that seeks out positive rewards. It’s this impulse that drives us to check our inbox over and over, even though we’re unsure when the next reward will arrive. It keeps us sifting through the endless junk mail and boring work and family messages to find those rare gems that make us feel excited and alive – whether it’s an email from a long-lost lover or a near-forgotten friend. However, email affects our psychology in more ways than one. It also provokes a progress paradox. When we put off doing important tasks by opening each email message at the moment it arrives, we’re tricking our brain. On the one hand, we feel productive because we’re reducing the number messages in our inbox, but, on the other hand, we’re accomplishing next to nothing. Nonetheless, getting that number of unread emails to zero is an almost irresistible reward since it triggers the same response we get from accomplishing an important task. But any email that can be swiftly discarded is generally insignificant and has no impact on our long-term goals. So don’t let this feeling of false progress fool you. There are more important things you could be doing with your time. Here’s an all-too-common scenario: You send off an email that was written with the best intentions, only to receive a reply that seems flat or perhaps even angry. The written word is, obviously, very different from verbal communication. Facial cues, tone of voice, body language – an email message can’t contain these things. And yet we often write messages in the same language we’d use in a face-to-face conversation. According to psychologist Daniel Goleman, this leads to a negativity bias: the reader of an email will always assume that the content is more negative than was intended. So if the sender felt good about the content, the reader will feel neutral. And if the sender felt neutral, the receiver will take it as being negative, and so on. Another problem with our reliance on email is the rule of reciprocity, which states that people feel obliged to respond to a positive act with a similarly positive act. But given the enormous amount of email messages people receive every day, this rule has become impossible to follow. It was a different story in the 1970s, when sociologist Phillip Kunz sent out 600 lovingly made Christmas cards to complete strangers. And sure enough, he received a great many responses, including handwritten letters that were several pages long. Many of these strangers continued to send him similar holiday greetings for the next 15 years. Kunz’s experiment highlights our desire to reciprocate, even when we didn’t ask for the original gesture. But nowadays, no one needs postage or even legible handwriting to contact you, not to mention the 50 other people to whom they can send blind carbon copies at the same time. This makes it impossible to keep up with the rule of reciprocity, a fact that can leave people feeling frustrated, guilty and ashamed. At this point you’re probably saying, “I know the problems, but what are the solutions?!” Well, you’ll be glad to know that there are a number of ways to regain control of your email. One of the good things about email is that you’re in charge of everything: how it looks, what it says and when it gets sent. But you also have a say in how many emails you receive. Remember, no one is pointing a gun at you demanding that you immediately respond to an email or that you respond in a certain way. It’s good to keep in mind that the more emails you send, the more emails you are likely to receive. This brings us to our first exercise, which is to take a moment to think about how you determine what work is important to you. Meaningful work should be seen as contributing to your life and legacy. So ask yourself, “Am I working on something that is going to make me better at what I do? Is it improving my career, or the lives of others?” Important work might be writing a book, improving your public-speaking skills or teaching creative writing to others. Whatever it is, you need to identify it, because until you do, you won’t be able to use email in a meaningful way. To stop wasting your time, you need to have something meaningful toward which to direct your attention. Only then will you be able to stop yourself from checking your inbox a hundred times a day and wasting your time writing meaningless responses. It also helps to write down the different jobs and tasks that contribute to the meaningful work. This will help you prioritize and make sure that whenever you’re using email, it will be in relation to something that’s important. Chances are, it would be unreasonable to remove email from your life altogether, so the question becomes: How can you figure out the optimal amount of time to spend on email? For this, you should create a daily routine that suits your needs. No matter who you are or what you do, it is probably best to avoid starting your day by checking your email messages. If you start going through your inbox before you’ve even brewed a cup of coffee or had a bite to eat, you’re essentially letting other people set your priorities. Before you know it, you’ll be wasting time and energy by responding to meaningless messages. Instead, devote the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day to meaningful work. Sure, your meaningful work might include writing an important email – but sticking to this rule of thumb will keep you from scrolling through all your unread messages and wasting your day’s first precious hour. The morning hours are a valuable time. It’s a time when your mind is fresh and sharp. It would be a shame to waste that clarity on random emails. But mornings aren’t the only time it’s bad to waste your energy on emails. It’s never a good time to waste your energy. The best way to avoid this is to be a “batcher” and only check your inbox two or three times a day. Batchers have an effective and less stressful approach to email since they tackle their messages in batches, rather than monitoring their inbox 24/7. This strategy leads to higher productivity. Since you’re not being constantly distracted, you’ll be able to focus and power through your emails at the appointed time, rather than aimlessly scrolling and replying. It’s also a healthier approach. A 2015 study showed that people who are constantly monitoring their email are more stressed than those who set specific times during the day to deal with their messages. If you’ve ever looked at your hundreds of unread email messages and thought, “There has to be a better way,” well, you were on to something. There are some easy tips and tricks to help you make the most of your daily batches of time. The first is to customize your inbox and create useful folders. With the right settings, your incoming emails will even organize themselves. To start with, you can set up different folders with varying degrees of prioritization. This way, emails from your boss and other important coworkers will be directed to a devoted folder marked “urgent”; those from other contacts will go into other folders that remind you it’s okay not to deal with them immediately. Separating important messages from less important messages will make it that much easier to maintain your productivity. You can also make a new habit of using quick replies that set clear expectations. It’s only a matter of time before you receive an important message that requires a lengthier and more thoughtful response than you have time for. So what’s the best thing to do? Push aside the more urgent and meaningful work? Type up a rushed response that you’ll regret the moment you send it? Neither of these solutions is ideal. In such a situation, the smart response is to send a quick response – one that lets the person know that you’ve received their email and that a full response will be given as soon as possible. It might go along these lines: “Dear Karen, thank you for your email. I agree, we need to discuss these new developments. Unfortunately, I am currently facing a deadline on an important project. I will send a more detailed message by the end of next week, when my schedule clears up.” Sending a considerate email like this takes just a minute or two, and it not only allows the recipient to set their expectations accordingly. It also lets them know that you’re thinking about the issue and not ignoring them. In our final blink, we’ll give you a few pointers on how to write a scintillating email message. These days, everyone seems to be extremely busy. This, in large part, is due to the many different distractions that we all have to deal with – the endless stream of incoming email and text messages, phone calls, not to mention any number of social-media and news updates. So how can you get the attention of customers and coworkers, family and friends? You have to write effectively, and the best way to do this is to be concise. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing the receiver’s attention before they’ve really started reading. A great way to prevent this from happening is to make a clear point right at the start. Say you want to invite a professor to speak at a conference you’re putting together. Don’t spend the first few paragraphs gushing about how much you admire her work and explaining what the entire conference is about. Provide a quick introduction and get right to the point with your proposal. Also consider the expectations of your recipient and put yourself in their shoes. Ask yourself two questions: “Are they angry, sad, happy, excited, overworked...?” And then, “What are they expecting from me?” With this in mind, you should have a good foundation for how to compose your message and decrease the risk of misunderstandings. This will ultimately make your efforts more productive since you won’t need to waste time clarifying or explaining yourself later on. Let’s say you’ve been tasked with making workplace improvements and are prepared to tell your boss about your new ideas. If you forget to put yourself in your boss’s shoes, you might forget that she’s busy this week and spend half a day writing a three-page email that she won’t have time to read, when it would have been better to send a brief and efficient message that lets her know that you’re prepared and excited to present your ideas whenever time permits. Whomever you’re writing to, be sure to consider how your message will most likely be read. The key message in this book: The days of wasting time on meaningless email messages are over. It’s time to reclaim your inbox and take control of your daily work life. With a few simple changes and some new habits, you can prioritize your life so that you’re spending your time on what matters most.  Actionable advice: Use VIP notifications Generally, you’re better off if you don’t check your mailbox more than twice a day. But there are always some people you don’t want to make wait – your boss, for instance, or your most important client. In such cases, you can compromise and set up your smartphone to notify you whenever a message from one of these VIPs comes in. This way, you can still refrain, by and large, from checking your inbox except at the designated times. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You need to sit on the lookout for ages, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. As you’ll learn in these blinks, it’s no different for humans. If you want to succeed, you need impeccable timing. This entails the ability to wait patiently for opportunity just as much as the ability to act quickly when it finally comes along. Waiting, even procrastinating, can help you become a better athlete, a savvier stock trader and a more successful marketing executive. What’s more, learning how to slow down will allow you to make better judgments in your personal life. In these blinks, you’ll find out why subliminal messages can make you crave more popcorn; how fast computers contributed to a global financial market crisis; and why a majority of doctors may be racist but not consciously know it. During a gripping tennis match, have you ever stopped to contemplate the ridiculousness of watching two people hit a ball, back and forth? This simple act, nonetheless, is mesmerizing; and it has everything to do with the rhythm and timing of this popular game.  Being a skilled tennis player isn’t just about good eyes and quick reactions. People tend to think that a tennis player’s talent is a product of his ability to rapidly ascertain the speed and trajectory of a ball. But the amount of time it takes for any person to visually register an action is more or less universal – around 200 milliseconds.  Another misconception is that tennis talent is tied to reaction speed – that is, the faster you can react, the better you should play. This is only partially correct. The best tennis players in the world have the ability to wait that essential extra split-second before returning a volley.  Once a player sees that his opponent is serving the ball, he has approximately 300 milliseconds to make a move. Most people move as quickly as they can, only to miss the ball altogether!  Skilled players are different. They can and will wait up to 200 milliseconds, taking in as much visual information as possible, before hitting the ball.  Many popular sports are in fact designed with this timing challenge in mind. If the space between a player and the net was greater, for example, a player would have more time to react. Conversely, if the distance was smaller, a player could only react in a knee-jerk fashion. Tennis is a great example of the human capacity for preconscious preparatory skills. A player has just enough time to pause, letting his unconscious mind formulate the best response but not enough time to consciously plan a move.  This sort of reaction isn’t exclusive to tennis champions, either. Split-second timing plays an essential role in business and finance, too.  Many of the things you do every day are made more efficient with computers. At the extreme end, markets are now dominated by high-frequency trading, the buying and selling of financial products at digital speeds.  High-frequency trading now accounts for 70 percent of all stock transactions in the United States. But even in the fast-paced world of Wall Street, stock traders realized at a certain point that going faster doesn't necessarily mean higher profits.  Let’s look at one example. Early on, the high-frequency trading firm UNX saw its profits rise when it increased the speed of its transactions. To further boost profits, the firm moved its headquarters from California to New York, reducing the distance electronic transactions would have to travel. In doing so, UNX cut transaction times from 65 milliseconds to 30 milliseconds.  Yet the decision came with an unintended side-effect. Suddenly the company’s profits started dropping. Unable to figure out why, the firm decided to return transaction speeds to the slower pace of 65 milliseconds. And as a result, profits also returned to positive levels.  So how can we explain what happened? Yale professor Frank Zhang examined a stock market crash on May 6, 2010 that lasted just 18 minutes but resulted in losses of trillions of dollars. He found that the rapid pace of trading had drastically increased the volatility of the market, leading to extreme swings in the value of financial products.  So it turns out that when trading happens too fast, traders can get caught in wide price swings, potentially leading to serious losses especially in moments of crisis. Yet there is a “sweet” speed, that provides just enough delay for a trader to avoid expensive mistakes.  Knowing this, financial experts are constantly seeking that “sweet” speed to optimize high-frequency trades. Have you ever watched the cult classic, Fight Club? Did you know that the film also has a single frame showing a full-frontal nude male? A shocking move for an American blockbuster, for sure!  While the only way the human eye can consciously “see” such an image is to watch the movie one frame at a time, the image can and does enter our subconscious, if even just for a millisecond. In fact, consumers have been wary of such “subliminal messages” for decades.  In 1957, James Vicary was purported to have flashed subliminal messages on the screen of a New Jersey movie theater using a high-speed tachistoscope, a tool that projects images for a set duration. The images, which flashed too quickly for moviegoers to consciously perceive, supposedly urged them to eat popcorn and drink Coca-Cola.  And guess what? According to Vicary, that theater saw popcorn sales rise by 58 percent and Coca-Cola sales jump by 18 percent. Once Vicary’s experiment went public, however, it caused a big scandal, with the public expressing hostility toward advertising agencies.  Yet later Vicary said he lied about the experiment; decades afterward study after study failed to prove with certainty the effect of subliminal images on human behavior.  Recently, however, new evidence has come to light suggesting that subliminal images can, in fact, produce a long-term effect on human behavior. In 2008, a study found that repeatedly flashing the Apple logo to people without their knowledge increased creativity, more than for those who were subliminally shown the IBM logo.  Even prior to this, another study showed that people who were exposed to messages or words related to old age or aging actually changed their behavior, and began to walk more slowly, perform worse in memory tests and even became more politically conservative! These experiments show that if you want to deliver a message, one strategy is to display it just long enough to have an effect, but still short enough so that people cannot consciously perceive it.  So now we know that timing plays a serious role in how we live and think. Yet how can you use timing to achieve your personal goals? Imagine you’re the captain of a football team. There’s 30 seconds left on the clock, and it’s up to you to make a game-changing decision. In such high-stakes moments, you need to know what you’re doing – and if you’re the captain, you probably do.  Experts don’t need to think before making a decision. In 1985, psychologist Gary Klein interviewed fireground commanders, the people in charge of firefighting operations, to determine how they made decisions in emergency situations.  Their answers were unanimous, in that they said they knew what to do, without deliberation, based on their experience. If a fire had spread, they would focus on rescuing people; if the fire was just beginning to spread, they would direct efforts toward putting it out.  Yet novices can’t trust gut instincts, because they don’t necessarily have them yet. Klein performed another study in which paramedics and medical students watched videos of six people performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  The participants didn’t know that only one of the six people in the videos was an actual paramedic. When asked which person they’d trust most to resuscitate them in an emergency, 90 percent of the paramedics instinctively chose the most qualified person, the paramedic. Yet just 30 percent of the students were able to identify the professional from the rest. Remember that no one can be an expert in every situation. This means when a scenario presents something new, you become a novice and should take your time making decisions.  US Navy Captain William Rogers could quickly discern enemy planes from civilian ones, but only when he had access to information provided by the ship’s controls. On one fateful day in 1988, the ship’s controls failed, and with this, Rogers ceased to function at an expert level.  Under pressure, he made a wrong decision, shooting down a suspicious-looking plane that turned out to be a civilian airliner. His mistake resulted in the deaths of 290 civilians.  If you had to pick out a racist in a crowd, what markers would you look for? Someone with a shaved head, or with racist-themed tattoos, or someone who resembles your doctor? Interestingly, many physicians without consciously realizing it give better care to white people than to black people. Over a hundred scientific studies have confirmed this troubling fact. If a white patient is suffering from chronic kidney failure, for instance, a doctor will be likely to recommend a transplant – the best, most expensive treatment option. The same holds for prescribing thrombolytic drugs to prevent heart attacks. But the same doctors will hesitate to offer equivalent care if the patient is black.  So when judging people, it’s better to question your initial response. While you can certainly make an instantaneous judgment about a person, know that your first impression can prove inaccurate when discerning certain characteristics.  A 2007 study led by psychologist Dana Carney found that when assessing complex human features like sociability and open-mindedness, a person’s estimates are more on point if a person takes at least five minutes to think about it.  Waiting before you make up your mind about someone allows you the chance to change or modify your gut reaction. So while the unconscious racism of doctors might be troubling, the good news is that such patterns can be changed.  In fact, when doctors had their attention drawn to this implicit bias, they started prescribing more medication to their black patients than to their white patients. Have you ever attended a speed-dating event, in which you quickly move from one potential partner to the next? Such methods may be misguided, as experience has shown that taking your time to find love is generally a more successful strategy.  When it comes to finding a partner, instant decisions can work against you. Online dating sites place an emphasis on photos, allowing a user to flip through and rapidly approve or disapprove of a person’s looks. This kind of superficial judgement can be counterproductive.  Irene LaCota, president of the dating service It’s Just Lunch, refuses on principle to let people see photos of a potential match. She thinks the quick reactions people make based on physical appearance are flawed. After all, such assumptions have nothing to do with whether two people are actually compatible.  When it comes to first dates, of course, timing is key. The goal of any first date is to decide whether you want to meet for a second! Thus, you need to get enough information about the other person to be able to trust your instincts. Yet it’s also important to stop before things get too personal, otherwise, you might feel obliged to accept a second date, regardless of how you feel.  So how can you accomplish both goals? By scheduling your first date at lunch. Doing lunch gives you enough time to meet, but keeps things short – after all, you’ve got to get back to work. The hour or so you’ve spent with the person gives you ample material to form a first impression; and now you’ve the freedom to think things over before agreeing to a second meeting.  Sure, sometimes you might want to make a snap decision, but it’s better to wait and think about your choice – even if things take a little longer. While you can decide whether someone is attractive in a heartbeat, it takes time to figure out how you really feel inside. By investing that time, you can increase your chances of finding a partner for life! Do you ever put off a task you hate, like doing your taxes? Of course you do. Here’s why.  Humans aren’t great at comparing short-term and long-term benefits. Psychiatrist George Ainslie found that, when offered a choice between $50 now and $100 in the future, most people chose the $50 up front.  But he also found that the same people would rather receive $100 dollars in six years than $50 in five years – which is essentially the same offer, just five years in the future.  The decision is skewed by short-term benefits in the first instance, but not in the second. And it’s for this same reason that people tend to choose being happy now over being happy later. This is what causes us to postpone things that might diminish our current pleasure, like filing our taxes.  In fact, procrastination is only a bad thing if you falsely discount the future effects of your actions. Not just that, but one benefit of procrastination is that it can make your life better in the short term.  For instance, say you’re driving home from work and hear your engine rattling. Would you stop at a repair shop to check it out, or go home and see if the sound disappears on its own? After a long day at the office, the second choice has profound short-term benefits. You’ll get to return to a warm house, a nourishing meal and a relaxing night.  Furthermore, a little procrastination also helps you think things over before rushing to a decision. For example, in the moment, your only option along the route home might be the most expensive repair shop in town.  However, if you stick to this pattern for too long, it will lead to problems. In this case, your car will eventually break down. Then you’ll have to wait for a tow truck and face a bigger repair bill than if you had addressed the issue earlier.  Do the people you admire the most rush around frantically, or are they composed, persistent and always watching for opportunity? When it comes to the positive side of procrastination, there’s a lot to be learned from successful people. For instance, investor Warren Buffett is a huge proponent of delaying decisions. In fact, for him, a solid investment strategy is to wait patiently.  But that doesn’t mean you should be lazy. In fact, Buffett works hard every day, following financial news and business developments. This means he’s always poised to act whenever the next investment opportunity rears its head.  President Barack Obama also deftly uses delay to his advantage, especially when diplomatically side-stepping tough interview questions. When Osama bin Laden was captured by US forces on May 2, 2011, Obama gave a 35-minute interview to CBS correspondent Steve Kroft.  In what turned out to be a highly dynamic interview, Kroft asked the president out of the blue if this event was the first time he had ordered someone to be killed.  Obama, however, didn’t jump to answer. He bided his time, avoiding the pointed question about illegal government assassinations, and instead carefully composed a statement about sending troops into combat with the awareness that lives would be lost.  So delay can be useful in all aspects of life. These blinks have provided you with the knowledge of experts, showing you how to avoid the mistake of acting too quickly. So wait! The key message in this book: Despite what most of us have been taught, procrastination and delaying action are not necessarily bad. In fact, there are many instances in which taking your time is instrumental to success. That’s because waiting, when used with critical awareness, can help you achieve amazing things.  Actionable advice: Revamp your dating profile. Are you one of those people who is always saying you wish the world was less superficial? Here’s your chance to do something. Remove all the photos from your online dating profiles and write something thoughtful and honest about yourself instead. And if a first date isn’t immediately attractive to you, take the time to listen to what he or she is saying, and think before you write them off.  Got feedback?

Most days, there’s so much to do that you can’t even think about the things that matter most to you. By the time you’re done packing lunch for the kids, answering emails at work and picking up groceries on the way home, you’re drained. So how on earth are you supposed to find the energy to spend some quality time with your friends and family, let alone make a start on that book you’ve always dreamed of writing? Well, best-selling author and renowned time-management expert Laura Vanderkam has a solution. There’s always time to do what you really want to, she argues. The trick is knowing where to look. And that’s something the world’s most successful highfliers know all about. Ask any one of them where they find the extra time to nurture their careers, relationships and personal dreams, and they’ll give you a three-word answer: in the morning. All it takes is careful planning, mindfulness about how you spend your time and bit of self-discipline. Master that, and you’ll be amazed by how much you can fit into your daily schedule. In the following blinks, you’ll find out how to use a time log to keep track of how you spend your time; why early nights and early starts will make you more productive; and how to apply your new time-management skills to other areas of your life. Mornings are hectic and often pass in the blink of an eye. You jump out of bed, bustle about getting the kids ready for school and then rush out the door and off to work. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Rethink your mornings and they can become an opportunity to do the things that matter most. The key is to stop postponing important tasks. Do them now rather than waiting for the perfect moment later on. Everyone wants more time to do the things they care about. For some, that’s exercise; for others, it’s reading or putting in a few hours on a long-term work project like writing an annual report. It’s all too easy to let daily chores and obligations distract you. And, by the time you’re done responding to work-related emails and doing the laundry, all you want to do is collapse in front of the TV. That makes mornings the perfect time to accomplish your goals. Take it from James Citrin, the leader of the headhunting agency Spencer Stuart’s North American Board and CEO Practice. He interviewed a group of high-flying executives about their morning routines, and 18 out of 20 of them had this one thing in common: they were up before 6 a.m. every day. Citrin is also an early riser, and he uses the morning hours to work out. The world is still calm in the wee hours – a perfect time for some quiet reflection! Then there’s Steve Reinemund, the former CEO and chairman of PepsiCo and the current dean of the School of Business at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. He gets up even earlier, starting his day at 5 a.m. with a four-mile run. After that, he takes some quality “me time” and either reads or prays. Next on the itinerary is a good breakfast with his kids. If he’s traveling, he makes sure he can stick to his tried-and-true routine by only ever staying in hotels with treadmills. Perhaps you’ve also tried to develop a morning routine but fallen prey to the temptation of grabbing some extra sleep. That’s a common enough problem. As we’ll see in the following blinks, it can be overcome. The secret? Willpower. What exactly is a good morning routine? Well, it doesn’t mean doing the laundry. That’s going to get done at some point anyway. The same goes for conference calls or anything else that you can do later on in the day. The best morning routines are about doing things that matter to you but require a little bit of extra self-motivation. These are the kinds of activities that don’t have an immediate payoff but might just change your life in the long run. Think of a creative project like writing a book or networking to support your career. It’s not something that you can finish in one go. But stick to it and you’ll build something that really makes a difference. This is exactly what the most successful people do every day. They spend their mornings nurturing one of three things: their careers, their relationships or themselves. Let’s start with your career. Nurturing your work life isn’t about quickly responding to emails as they land in your inbox. It’s about attending to activities that you rarely have enough time for over the course of a normal day. Take Debbie Moysychyn, an organizational health care executive who’s helping Brand University build up their health-care education department. She wanted to foster a collaborative, open-door culture in her office. That meant literally keeping her door open and letting people know that they were free to pop in at any time for a chat. It was a great idea, but there was a problem. Constant, short meetings with her colleagues ended up distracting her from other tasks. In the end, she just didn’t have enough time for projects that were important to her. Her solution? Setting aside her mornings to get her work done. That gave her the time and space to fully focus her mind on the task at hand without constantly worrying about interruptions. More importantly still, it allowed her to contribute to a better office culture over the rest of the day while still finishing her own projects. So that’s how your morning routine can help nurture your career. In the next blink, you’ll learn a bit more about how to nurture yourself and your relationships. Your career is important, but it’s just one of the pillars that support a fulfilling life. Relationships are another pillar. How often have you come home from work and found yourself too tired to spend quality time with your friends and family? Well, that’s why it’s time to start using your mornings to nurture your relationships! When you think about it, mornings are actually the perfect opportunity to spend time with those you love. After all, you won’t be drained after a long day in the office or longing to vegetate in front of the TV. There are all sorts of ways you can start getting the most out of the early hours. Why not have sex at dawn with your partner? Or you could make breakfast the new dinner – a time to gather round the table with the whole family. Whatever you do, it’s a great way of staying in touch with the most important people in your life. Take it from Kathryn Beaumont Murphy, a busy tax lawyer whose punishing schedule involves plenty of late nights. She decided to make a change when she noticed how her work life was preventing her from spending time with her daughter. After talking to the author, she realized that her law firm rewarded late hours rather than early starts. Mornings were usually calm, and there was little that required urgent attention. Beaumont decided to start going to bed earlier so she could add a couple of hours onto her day in the morning. Her new routine proved infectious. Now the whole family rises early and makes an effort to make breakfast special! That brings us to the third pillar you need to take care of if you want a more balanced life: self-care. “Me time” is usually one of the first things to be sacrificed when life gets hectic. Responsibilities, work and social commitments often trump the time you’ve earmarked for yourself. The answer is to free up time for self-nurture in the morning. Ask yourself what it is that really matters to you. Some people want to train for a marathon, others to read more, write poetry, meditate or paint. Whatever it is, you can take a cue from the executives James Citrin interviewed. By getting up early, they make time to do what they love. Now that you’ve seen just how much you can get done in the morning, it’s time to ask the all-important question: How do you start putting your new morning routine into action? There are five key steps. In this blink, you’ll learn about the first two. Start making your morning more productive by recording how you spend your time over the week. A week has 168 hours. If you want to get the most out of that and improve your time management, you need to know where all that time is going. The problem isn’t usually how you spend your mornings but what you do with the rest of the day. Late nights are especially detrimental to your ability to make an early start, but it’s easy to fall into the trap. Maybe you’re writing emails or just watching TV. Whatever it is, burning the candle at both ends isn’t viable in the long run. Eventually, you’ll be too tired to get up early. That said, you might be able to free up an hour or two early on in the day once you start recording how you spend your time. Maybe you can give your kids lunch money rather than packing their lunch boxes yourself. So that’s step one – grab a notebook and start tracking your time! Step two is simple: picture your ideal morning. To do that, ask yourself what your perfect start to the day would look like. Now that you’ve made a record of how you use your time, you can start envisioning how things could be different. Consider the author. Her dream morning starts at 6:20 a.m. That’s when she gets up, unless she’s in the mood for early morning sex. Otherwise, she hits the road ten minutes later for her 45-minute run. After that comes a hearty breakfast with the whole family together around the dining table. That’s the perfect chance to catch up and have a meaningful conversation. Finally, when everyone else has left the house, she sits down to work on her book and write an entry for her blog. That doesn’t have to be your perfect morning, of course. The key is to start picturing what an ideal start to the day looks like for you! Now that you have a better understanding of how you spend your time over the week and have pictured your perfect morning, let’s turn to the third step. This is all about logistics. Put differently, it’s about figuring out if your ideal morning routine is doable. Start by calculating how much time you’d actually need for it. Can you make changes in other areas to accommodate your new plans? Say you want to free up some extra time to prepare breakfast. Well, you could spend five minutes in the shower rather than fifteen. Remember, forewarned is forearmed. If you want your new plan to succeed, you’ll need to map everything out. If you’ve made it this far, you’ve reached the most exciting step – creating your new habits! It takes time to cement new habits. So start slow and be patient. Sometimes it takes weeks to get into the groove of a new routine. Taking your time is especially important, because you don’t want to feel overwhelmed by the end of the first fortnight. That’s the crunch point, when sticking to your regimen gets tricky. Not taking on too much will help keep your motivation levels high enough to get through this rough patch. So if you’ve decided you want to spend your mornings running, meditating and writing, start by doing just one of those activities. You can always add others later on. Rewards, or what the author calls “bribes,” are also useful when it comes to motivation. If you’ve done well and stuck to your plan, give yourself a treat. That could be something like opera tickets or a meal in a nice restaurant. Finally, step five. This is essentially about fine-tuning your routine. Life is full of sudden changes. If you want your new routine to stick, you’ll have to be adaptable and learn to make constant adjustments and readjustments. Take it from the author, an avid morning runner. When she was expecting her first daughter, she had to change her regimen. Running just wasn’t possible as her pregnancy progressed. So she put it on the back burner and devoted more time to nurturing herself. But now that her children are older, there’s more time for running again. Today, she’s back to her old routine and spends three quarters of an hour running before sitting down for breakfast with her family. Weekends are your opportunity to get some well-deserved rest and recharge your mental and physical batteries, which are integral to your well-being. But it’s all too easy to waste these precious hours on a random hodgepodge of activities. By the time Monday rolls round, you realize you haven’t gotten as much out of your time off as you could have. There’s a simple way of making weekends more meaningful: planning ahead. Rather than spontaneously deciding what to do come Saturday morning, make a list of between three and five anchor activities a couple of days in advance. That’s a good way of avoiding one of the classic ways of wasting a weekend – “doing nothing,” something that’s always an attractive option at the end of a draining week. The problem is that there’s no such thing as doing nothing in the digital age. In the past, people might have spent their time lounging on a lawn listening to the birds and watching the clouds go by. Today, you’re more likely to be watching TV, surfing the internet and checking your social media. Having a plan cuts all that pointless low-key activity out. There’s no need to go overboard and decide what you’ll be doing every minute of the day; you just need a couple of activities to structure your weekend around. What those are is entirely up to you. You might want to go on a picnic with your family or go to the movies. And there’s one more thing to keep in mind. If you want to get the most out of your weekend, make sure to plan out-of-the-ordinary activities and learn to savor the sense of anticipation as the week winds down. The point of weekends is that they’re not like the rest of the week. What you need is a break. That’s why it’s so important to do things you wouldn’t do on any of the other five days. That takes a bit of thought, which is why you’ll need to plan ahead. But planning has its own benefits. Knowing that you’ve got something fun penciled into your diary gives you something to look forward to. You should take pleasure in that. Just think of the way anticipation is such an essential part of Christmas. Waiting to open your presents is what makes the occasion so special! So now you know how important planning is. In the next blink, we’ll explore some practical tips to help you go about doing that. There are lots of different ways of planning your weekend. Let’s take a look at a couple of strategies you can start putting into action today. The first tip is to make a list of your top one hundred dreams. That might sound like a lot, but there’s a good reason to jot down so many. If you only listed your top ten dreams, you’d likely end up with extravagant wishes like visiting the ancient ruins of Mexico or having a private dinner in the Louvre. There’s nothing wrong with dreaming big, of course, but you’re unlikely to do anything as extravagant as that on an average weekend! Once you start extending the list, however, you’ll get to the things you can do on a regular Saturday or Sunday. That might be something like drinking a huge strawberry milkshake while your kids are busy playing in the park. So grab a notebook and start writing! Even better, get your partner or family members to do the same. You can see where you overlap and start coordinating a fantastic weekend together. But remember, planning doesn’t mean accounting for every second. Loose plans are fine, so keep it simple. You don’t need more detail than “Sunday lunch with Anne and Peter” or “Take the children to the beach on Saturday afternoon.” Finally, there’s downtime. Weekends are your chance to rejuvenate. If you want to get some rest, plan it in. That’s even possible if you have a house full of exuberant young children. The key is to let your kids know that rest is important to you. So if you want an hour’s nap, tell them that’s what you’re planning. Soon enough, that’ll become part of your household’s routine. You can make that even easier by accounting for their needs at the same time. Why not pencil in an hour of screen time for them while you’re dozing? Follow these tips and you’ll soon be enjoying restful and pleasurable weekends that set you up for the week ahead. Which brings us to our next topic – work. In the next couple of blinks, we’ll take a look at how improving your time management can help your career. How much time do you spend working, sleeping and doing chores? Tally it up and then ask yourself a question: Are you really sure that’s right? Most people think they know where their hours go, but it’s common to overestimate some things, such as sleep, and underestimate others, such as housework. Work falls into the first category. People generally overestimate. That makes getting a realistic overview of how you spend your time key. The trick is to learn to mind your hours. This technique will help you optimize your time management at work. Pay careful attention to your hours and you might realize that you actually work a 50-hour, not an 80-hour, week. There’s a simple enough reason for these kinds of assumptions: people overestimate the time it takes to do things they don’t like and underestimate the time they spend doing things they do like. That’s why chores or writing emails seem to take an age, but you never feel as though you’ve gotten enough sleep. The former are unpleasant activities while the latter is something everyone loves. Keeping a time log will give a much more realistic overview of your days. Aim to record your allotment of time over an entire week, making a note of all the hours spent working, tidying and so on. You can use a spreadsheet or an app, if it helps. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready for the next step. This is all about using your time log to help you plan your week more wisely. That will make your work much more productive. Take it from Michael Soenen, the mind behind EmergencyLink, a website that stores personal information such as your medical history for the use of emergency first responders. He uses his Sunday afternoons to think about EmergencyLink’s priorities over the coming weeks. Once he’s worked them out, he shares his insights with his team. That means everyone knows exactly what they need to do on Monday morning, which enables them to use their time effectively rather than running around like headless chickens. So pencil some planning time into your calendar. You’ll find that when you plan for things to happen, they usually do. You might just get around to writing that annual report you’ve been putting off for so long! Success is the fruit of planning. To be successful, you first have to make success possible. That sounds like a tautology, right? Well, there’s actually more to it than meets the eye. Laying the groundwork for success is all about carefully choosing your priorities for the day ahead – every day. To do that, you need an accountability system that won’t let you down. Let’s start with the first part. Setting lofty goals is all well and good, but it means you’ll often end up falling short. That’s because there’s no way for you to achieve them on a daily basis. Take the well-known American fitness entrepreneur Chalene Johnson. She sold two of her businesses to the fitness company Beachbody and became one of their consultants. Her long-term aim was to make the firm more profitable. But that’s just not something you can do on an average day in the office. Johnson’s solution was to set herself smaller and more achievable daily goals. By hitting her targets every day, she worked, slowly but surely, toward fulfilling her bigger ambition. For example, she’d aim to arrange a teleconference with her CEO to talk marketing one day and set up a meeting with a project partner to discuss strategy another. Achieving these smaller goals kept her motivation levels sky-high. Accountability is the second key to achieving success. It’s all about sharing your aims with someone else. Call them an “accountability partner.” Their role is to check in and let you know whether you’ve met your daily or weekly targets. So much for planning. The next step on the road to success is to cut out tasks that feel like work but don’t actually achieve anything. Think of emails. Writing and answering a hundred messages is part and parcel of today’s digital world. Some of them are essential, of course, but it’s easy to end up feeling utterly swamped while not really getting anything done. Sometimes it’s better to shut your inbox and get down to what really matters. That might be working on a presentation or preparing for an upcoming team meeting. Cut out distractions and you’ll find that the really important tasks actually take far less time than you’d imagined! There are things we’ve all heard a million times before and yet still find hard to put into action. In this final blink, we’ll take a look at some time-honored truths it might be useful to remind yourself of. First off – practice makes perfect. One of the great obstacles to improvement is running on autopilot. Consider driving. You get into your car, turn the ignition key and hit the road. By the time you’ve arrived at your destination, you can barely remember your journey. That’s a handy skill, but it doesn’t make you a better driver. If you want to improve, you need to practice deliberately. Think of an aspiring author. Would she be better off writing endless reams of prose or asking one of her peers to read and critique her work? The second option is the harder of the two. After all, criticism stings, even when it’s well meant. But it’s also the only way forward. The writer who asks for help and adjusts her style to take on board the critique she’s received will simply be a better stylist than the hermit working on autopilot. Next up is learning to keep a deposit of career capital you can use for future opportunities. Career capital is basically everything you’ve earned so far during your work life – your experience, networks, skills and professional personality. Think of it as a currency you can use to buy new opportunities, such as a promotion. Keeping your account well-stocked means that you’ll be able to afford more. One of the best ways of making sure your account is in the black is to nurture your relationships. That’s all about establishing trust. When people know they can rely on you, they’re much more likely to pass on tips and throw in a good word for you. Finally, there’s happiness. The more attentive you are to signs of success, the happier you’ll be. That’s backed up by a study carried out by Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile and developmental psychologist Steven Kramer. In their book The Progress Principle (2012), they looked at 12,000 diary entries by different teams in several organizations across the United States. They found that 76 percent of the days on which employees were happy were also days on which they made a breakthrough. Noticing the signs of success – like positive feedback or a eureka moment during a difficult project – is sure to make you happier, too! The key message in these blinks: Proper time management won’t just make your mornings less hectic and keep your stress levels down, it’ll also boost your productivity in the office and help you get the most out of your weekends. The key is learning how to keep track of time. Once you know where all that time goes, you can start making plans to use your hours more efficiently. And that’s great for your career and your personal life! Actionable advice: Take it slow and go easy on the to-dos. Weekends are all about rejuvenation. They’re your chance to take some time out and recharge your batteries. That doesn’t just mean getting rest, though. Like a holiday, they’re about doing the things you don’t have time for in your everyday life. So don’t spoil them by working through an endless list of chores! Think about what you’d really like to do. Maybe it’s a day trip or just enjoying a coffee in a café. Whatever it is, make your plans and stick to them. The laundry can usually wait until Monday evening! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Pink","summary":"As Miles Davis once said, “Time isn’t the main thing. It’s the only thing.” While he was likely talking about music and not the day-to-day affairs of students and professionals, the statement nonetheless applies to all of us. We spend much of our lives trying to be on time, meet deadlines and get the most efficient results out of what time we have. We spend so much of our life living by the clock that, as you’ll learn in these blinks, there’s a very strong emotional pattern that most of us exist in from Monday to Friday. You’ll also get a glimpse into the vast amount of research conducted on why we do certain things when we do them and just how important timing is to us. Even if you pride yourself on not living the nine-to-five lifestyle, you’re still likely to find a great deal of insight into human nature in these blinks. You’ll also discover when you should avoid the operating table; what a napuccino is; and why so many 29-year-olds run marathons. People love their daily routines. Day in and day out, we brush our teeth, have a shower, get a cup of coffee, take the dog for a walk, check the mailbox, read the news and so forth. But did you know that, in parallel to these habits, there’s another, subtler pattern to our daily lives? Researchers at Cornell University looked at Twitter to try and get a sense of the prevailing moods of people during a typical day. By examining 500 million tweets from over a two-year period, they saw a very clear pattern emerge: There’s a general feeling of positivity that peaks during the morning, drops swiftly in the afternoon and then climbs back up in the evening. This cycle happens every weekday, to pretty much everyone, regardless of race or nationality. Of course, Twitter isn’t the best gauge for emotional accuracy since it isn’t exactly known for its honesty. And the software the researchers used to scan for words with certain emotional significance can’t pick up on when those words are being used sarcastically; nevertheless, this same pattern has been noticed in other studies, too: Behavioral scientists, using what’s known as the day reconstruction method (DRM) to go hour by hour through people’s lives, found the same pattern: positivity or happiness levels peak in the morning, plummet in the afternoon and then rebound, or climb back up, and peak again in the evening. This daily pattern is known as the morning peak, afternoon trough and evening rebound. Likewise, negativity levels show the exact opposite: they’re on the rise in the afternoon and fall in the evening. What’s interesting is that this pattern has a very direct impact on the work we do. In a separate study that revealed very similar findings, three professors at American business schools analyzed over 26,000 earnings calls – conference calls between a company’s CEO and the primary investors, where they discuss how things have been going and how they expect things to go in the future. These calls often determine whether stock prices rise or fall. The study showed that the later in the day the calls took place, the worse the “emotional tenor” was, and, as the day went on, the more negative the calls would get. Across over 2,000 public companies, the advice was the same: conduct your earnings calls bright and early in the morning to keep them upbeat and positive. So there’s substantial evidence that our emotional levels tend to follow a daily pattern – but that doesn’t mean everyone’s pattern is the same. Although everyone shares the afternoon energy trough, there’s a good chance you have friends or family whose schedule is otherwise different. Studies show that, on average, one in every four people has a differing internal clock, or what’s known as a chronotype. In addition to the normal chronotype, which experiences the morning peak, afternoon trough and evening rebound, there are two others: the night owl and, to use the author’s term for early risers, the lark. Research suggests that 20 to 25 percent of people are owls, who, like inventor Thomas Edison and novelist Gustave Flaubert, peak around 9:00 p.m., which is when they prefer to get down to business, and tend to experience their positive rebound in the morning. Indeed, studies on sleep patterns and personality types show that owls tend to be more creative types, as well as a bit more neurotic, impulsive and depressive than the usual type. As for larks, these are the “early to bed, early to rise” folks who simply tend to experience the peak, trough and rebound a few hours earlier than normal. They’re also usually a bit more stable, happy, agreeable and introverted than the rest. To make the most of your day, and to schedule it as efficiently as possible, you should identify your own chronotype and understand that certain tasks are best handled during certain times of the day. For instance, if you’re among the 60 to 80 percent of people who are neither larks nor owls (a group the author calls the “third bird”), then the morning peak is the best time to handle analytical tasks that require a logical, focused and disciplined mind. As for tasks that require more abstract or “outside the box” thinking, this is best handled during the rebound of the late afternoon and early evening. However, if you’re an owl, you should reverse this advice. Since your peak is at night, this is the time to think analytically, while the morning is for creative and insightful tasks. No matter who you are, try to schedule the mindless, busy-work tasks during the afternoon trough. And if you’re trying to get a favorable decision from someone, always try to book a morning appointment. You may know what your current chronotype is, but here’s the thing: we tend to move through these different types as we age. Young kids and older folks are generally larks, while teenagers tend to be owls. This is why teens suffer when high-school classes start before 8:00 a.m., especially when math class is scheduled for the first period, and they’re forced to think analytically at the worst possible time. Luckily, schools have started to understand how important timing, scheduling and taking breaks really is. In Denmark, where a lot of importance is placed on standardized testing, research results have clearly shown that student scores get worse as the day wears on. Hospitals have also noticed that the standards of care and focus of staff drop precipitously as the day progresses. Medical mistakes are often a matter of life and death, making this a particularly pressing issue. And studies show that mistakes are most common between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. In fact, at 9:00 a.m., there’s only a 1 percent chance of slip-ups; by 4:00 p.m., that chance quadruples to 4.2 percent. Furthermore, in the afternoon, hospital staff wash their hands 38-percent less often than they’re supposed to. Researchers believe that due to this decrease in hygiene standards as the day wears on, there are around 600,000 avoidable infections in US hospitals every year, adding up to $12.5 billion in unnecessary costs. And the best solution for both attaining better test results in schools and making fewer mistakes in hospitals is the same: take a break. In Denmark, schools that took a 20- to 30-minute break before an afternoon test saw an improvement in scores that was actually greater than the recorded afternoon decline had been. As for the hospitals, the introduction of “vigilance breaks” at the University of Michigan Medical Center has resulted in great improvements. During such a break, a team takes a moment, pre-operation, to review instructions, make sure everyone knows what everyone else is doing and confirm that each team member is well prepared. The result? Improved care statistics and fewer complaints. Over the past ten years or so, we’ve been moving in the wrong direction when it comes to taking breaks. Many schools have reduced, or entirely gotten rid of, recess breaks, in the mistaken belief that this would improve grades. But as we saw in the previous blink, breaks, when timed well, are actually extremely beneficial. They expand your cognitive abilities and improve your mood, acting as an overall refresher for the mind and body. Desktime, a company that develops desktop productivity software, has looked at the results of their users and determined that, on average, the ideal break for maximum productivity would be to take 17 minutes off for every 52 minutes of work. But even a five-minute break every hour or so has been shown to reduce fatigue and boost motivation, creativity and overall mood. Socializing, even when it’s just a small chat at the water cooler, is a proven stress reducer, as is avoiding all email, texts and other work-related business during your break. And, finally, there’s data showing that time outdoors, among the trees and the chirping birds, can improve both your mental and emotional state. Taken together, these findings indicate that the ideal break would be to leave your phone behind and join a friend on a short walk outdoors, perhaps through a park. Another great restorative activity is the good old-fashioned nap. Now, you might be thinking that this is not for you because naps leave you feeling groggy. But this is likely because your nap was too long. Anything over 20 minutes can cause “sleep inertia,” which is just a scientific way of saying groggy. The perfect nap is anywhere from 10- to 20-minutes long, a period of time shown to provide the napper with three hours of improved focus and a higher capacity for retaining information. And believe it or not, studies have shown that a quick cup of coffee before your nap can give you an even better boost. Since caffeine takes 20 minutes to enter the bloodstream and start working its magic, it’s actually perfect for incorporating into a well-timed nap. Known as the napuccino, this involves drinking your coffee, setting your timer for 20 minutes, which takes into account the average 7 minutes it takes to fall asleep, and then waking up ready to take on the world. We like to imagine that, no matter the undertaking, we’ll hit the ground running and get off to a good start effortlessly. But, in reality, we’re bound to encounter a challenging takeoff at least once in a while. Here’s a helpful tool that the author uses to ensure things go as smoothly as possible with any new endeavor: a premortem. It’s like a postmortem, the procedure a mortician would go through at a hospital, only moved up to before a project even begins. In other words, imagine all the ways in which your project might die and identify all the possible causes of death so that you can be sure to avoid them. For example, could having too many people work on it mess things up? Or not having enough? Is the objective too vague? By figuring out the most likely problems, you can better avoid them. Now, even though most advice on productivity generally focuses on beginnings and endings, meaning how to get off to a good start in something or finish it successfully, there’s quite a bit of data that shows how important the middle is too. Researcher Connie Gersick calls it the uh-oh effect. After videotaping and studying the efforts of hospital, bank and university staff, Gersick was amazed to see the same behavior crop up time and time again. A project would start, nothing would get done and then, at the precise midpoint, between the start and the deadline, the team would get together and say, uh-oh, we need to get to work. Only then would they start making progress. It’s perhaps no coincidence that a similar thing happens in sports – particularly basketball. When a team is down by one point at halftime, it actually has a greater chance of winning, because its members are practically guaranteed to come out of their halftime pep talk with an increased urgency to play their best and outscore the other team. By recognizing that the midpoint is the perfect place to give your team a spark of motivation and productivity, you can use the oh-uh moment to your advantage and turn the last leg of the project into a flurry of activity. You’ve just learned about the good that can come out of a midpoint crisis, but there’s also a bad version, where people panic and the last leg of a project becomes a disorganized mess. Here are some tips on how to help your team get through an eventual midway slump and reach a successful finish. First of all, be sure to establish a shared vision about the goals of the project. If things aren’t going well at the midpoint, you can always return to this vision in order to reengage and motivate people by reminding them what you set out to do. Don’t start assigning new roles and introducing new ideas. Instead, reassert the established roles, remind people what it was all about and ignite the spark that will get people moving. Be aware, however, that people tend to behave in extreme ways when nearing a project’s end. When they’re close to crossing the finish line and achieving a goal, they may, for example, try to do something big or rash. This is due in large part to the fact that we give disproportionate meaning to endings, so we want to add as much meaning as we can in the final moments. For example, let’s look at the lives of two imaginary CEOs. One spent 50 years giving to charity but turned cruel and selfish in the last two years of her life. The other spent 50 years being cruel and selfish but decided to give to charity and be kind in her last two years. One life was clearly better spent, but studies have shown that when presented with these two scenarios, people tend to give disproportionate importance to the endings and rate the lives as equally good. One phenomenon stemming from our emphasis on endings is that 9-enders – a name for people aged 29, 39, 49 and so on – tend to be more inclined to do extreme things, like run a marathon for the first time, start an affair or commit suicide. So people overemphasize the importance of endings, and they usually display extreme behavior near the end. This tendency is almost as predictable as our desire for endings to be happy. And not only happy – but poignant. Poignancy is that bittersweet happiness that is shaded by sadness, an emotion that seems to capture the essence of the human condition. Pixar, with movies like the tear-jerker Up, is a poignancy pro. Knowing this, we can take steps to make our endings more satisfying. For instance, when you’re graduating school or ending a position at a job, write a letter to your future self, and don’t read it for five years. You might think you won’t be that interested in what you have to say to yourself in five years, but you’ll likely be quite moved when the time comes. Such letters bridge the gap between past and present, which is one of the best ways to achieve poignancy in your own life. Many gurus will tell you that happiness comes by living in the moment or being fully in the present. But this is only half of it. The real reward, the real feeling of satisfaction, comes when your current self feels close to your past and future selves. We often think that, in five or ten years time, we’ll be completely different than we are now. And, feeling utter detachment from this future person, we don’t do the things that might help that future self, such as saving money or eating healthily. But when you ask someone to start thinking just a few days into the future, you can actually get them to feel closer to that future self and adopt behaviors like saving money. Time is a slippery word and an even slipperier concept. We can easily get lost in time, but our experience greatly improves when we start to take control and better understand how our past, present and future all relate to each other. The key message in this book: There’s a science to timing and how to get the most out of life. By understanding your own chronotype, taking breaks and naps, leveraging the power of the middle point in projects and writing your future self letters, you can use time to your advantage.  Actionable advice: Get the most out of your coffee. Don’t drink coffee first thing in the morning. Coffee has been shown to interfere with cortisol, a hormone that naturally helps you wake up. So drink some water first, to hydrate and help control hunger, and have your first cup of coffee 60 to 90 minutes after waking up. You’ll get the most benefit that way. Got feedback?

Every busy executive at one point or another has been seduced by time-management tricks or tools that promise huge productivity gains. The problem with these approaches is they’re often one-size-fits-all solutions – which means they’re not much of a solution at all. Such tools don’t take into account that each person uses her time differently, and therefore needs an individual solution to manage time more effectively. In the following blinks, you’ll see you can’t manage time as if it was an unruly employee. Once you realize that, you’ll find a better path toward working more effectively; a way that better matches your personality, with the result that you’ll be able to get more done. After reading these blinks, you’ll learn which productivity personality you are; why you just can’t budget time; and how to pay better attention to how your brain works. Have you ever been told you’re a “left-brained” or “right-brained” thinker? If so, you already know what’s wrong with so many time management and productivity theories. These tools think that “one size fits all.” So just make more lists, they say, and you’ll improve. Yet everyone has their own way of working, and what helps one person be more productive could be counterproductive to another. That’s why the most effective way to start working better is to examine yourself and approach your work in a fashion that fits your personality. This is where the productivity style assessment can help. A productivity style assessment is a test that is based on the findings of General Electric’s long-time manager of management education, Ned Herrmann. It examines how the brain perceives, processes, comprehends, manages and communicates information. In other words, a productivity style assessment explains how people work! While there are many different personalities, Hermann’s model offers four particular styles as a guide to start your assessment. Which style are you? The first is the prioritizer. She’s efficient with her time and uses data, thoughtful analysis and logic to approach and solve problems. At work, she prioritizes the most important tasks and is annoyed when colleagues chatter while there’s work to be done. The second is the planner. He loves making lists, organizing data and doing things in a particular order. When he gets to work, he reviews his schedule and shakes his head at some last-minute project his more unorganized colleagues are scrambling to finish. The third is the arranger, who relies on his instinct to make decisions. He works well with others, and enjoys presenting information visually, as in a colorful flowchart. His main concern: “How will this decision make people feel?” And last, there’s the visualizer, who can walk into a heated discussion and find a way to reorganize all the key points that solves everyone’s problems. When making decisions, she hates being dragged down by data, but will gather everyone’s input and synthesize it into something new – even if it’s contrary to “the way it’s always been done.” Once you understand that you can control your present and your future, it’s time to act! The best way to do this is to think differently about how you approach time management. The thing is, time is not actually manageable. We cannot make time bend to our rules. It is, however, our most important resource. This is what professor Randy Pausch emphasized in his famous 2007 talk and book, The Last Lecture. Pausch was suffering from terminal cancer and as part of his talk, told his students that while earning more money is often achievable, earning more time is not. Consider, then, what your time budget might look like. To deal with the challenge of time, you should plan your activities daily, weekly and monthly, so you can spend your time in the most efficient way possible. It also helps to write a master task list. A master task list contains all the things you need to do to accomplish your goals. When you have done this, organize these things into two categories: project actions and next actions. Project actions are overarching tasks that require smaller action steps, and can take days or months to finish, such as reorganizing your kitchen or planning an off-site workshop. A next action is a single step, something that moves you forward. These should be listed starting with an action verb, for example: Call Adam. Or perhaps: Revise speech. The point of a master task list is to release you from the burden of keeping the innumerable amount of tasks you want to complete swimming in your head all at the same time. Noting everything you need to do – socially and  professionally – gives you a chance to act and enables you to rethink and revise any future actions. Ever feel as if you can’t make yourself pay proper attention? It’s vital that you harness this skill, as what you pay attention to has a significant impact on your productivity and your happiness.Attention is a precious resource, and you need willpower to direct and control it. Each day, you can devote your attention to just a limited number of things, as attention is not infinite. Yet, the better you are able to get a grip on your focus, the more you can achieve. This is because focusing clearly on one task will prevent you from being distracted by other goals. Focusing your attention holds different challenges for different personality types. Recall your personality type and see if any of these details pertain to you. A visualizer can get tangled up in irrelevant details and lose track of the main goal. Arrangers have a tendency to forget their real goals and become submissive, due to their need to be appreciated. Prioritizers can push their first priority way too hard, leaving little space for any other work; while planners often miss out on great opportunities when they skirt around ideas that are more abstract. While different personality quirks certainly make managing attention challenging, the reality is that we all need to fight for our attention daily. In 2005, Basex, an information technology research firm, reported that almost a third of working hours are squandered on interruptions and distractions. Since smartphones have since become commonplace, this statistic is probably overly optimistic. Attention to work must be balanced with attention to other things in life. Your daily routines should complement your attention span. Some people are more focused after a walk, while others concentrate better after working out. Eating and sleeping habits should work with your attention patterns in the same way listening to music or alternating alone time or socializing should. The key is to find the activities that support your attention and stick to them! Pause for a moment and consider how your mind works for you, or against you. The truth is, our minds can actually sabotage us! But we have the power to change this. First, you need to realize that you can only process a certain amount of information at once. This usually means taking in around two to three chunks of information at a time. This is why most of us struggle to recall more than a few names of people we’ve just met. We process input subconsciously and unsystematically, but patterns do exist in accordance with our productivity style. Remember how we can’t manage time? Trying to do so is like trying to force square pegs into round holes. That’s why time management approaches are ineffective and often lean on senseless schedules, not taking into account an individual’s personality or productivity style. If you are a prioritizer and web design is the most important thing to you at the moment, it might be helpful to spend as much time on it as you can, even if it seems too much at first. In the long run, you’ll get the best results, because it’s a task you had to do. What wouldn’t make sense, is if you tackled your productivity problem in the exact same fashion as every other web designer. You are your own person; you have your own personality and productivity style. Find what works for you and don’t accept a cookie-cutter approach as the rule! Because time is linear, we often feel we have to get things done in a linear fashion. Yet unless you’re already a planner or prioritizer, this approach can work against your productivity style. For example, as a visualizer, you could gather information from many different places, which might give you inspiration for your next project. If you force yourself to think in a more linear fashion, though, you’ll end up stunting your creativity. In short, finding and sticking to your own style of thinking and working will help you live up to your full potential! The key message in this book: To remember the key lessons from these blinks, just keep in mind the phrase \"Know the TWIST\": You need Know yourself, learn to manage your Time, have the WIllpower to focus on the tasks at hand and find your own productivity STyle. Actionable advice: Know yourself and how you work. The next time you start a project, take notes on the task, particularly how it fits your goal and how much you liked doing it. Do this a few days in a row and you’ll gain practical insight on how you can tweak your working style to best fit your personality and make lighter work of your daily tasks. What to read next: The Best Place to Work, by Ron Friedman Now that you know how to find your own unique TWIST to becoming more productive, it’s time to look at your work from another perspective and ask a simple question: Do you like going to work? Sadly, studies show that, if you do, you’re in the minority.   So what makes for a great workplace? In The Best Place to Work, award-winning psychologist Ron Friedman explores this topic and shows what you can do to improve your work life.

Can you see them? Can you feel them? OK, relax, we’re not talking about invisible aliens. We’re talking about systems. Unlike invisible aliens, these systems really do influence so much of what we do every day. Whether it’s driving to work or running errands with the family, think about all the systems that affect you. The traffic on the highway, parking lots, fossil fuel prices, your company’s administrative processes, even the social systems of communication and language. Systems are everywhere. Once you start to see systems everywhere, you can start to think about how you can flip the script: Instead of them just affecting you, how can you work them? These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to be a better systems manager; why 100-percent-perfect systems aren’t the goal; and how systems are just as prominent at home as at work. Do you ever feel like you are just a helpless grain of sand in a dust storm of chaos beyond your control? Well, it’s not chaos that rules the world, but an underlying inherent order, even if we can’t always see it. Think about it: No one is in charge of running the world, yet everything works fine 99.9 percent of the time. How can this be? This is because systems, i.e., multitudes of diverse parts all working together to accomplish a single goal, are inherently inclined to stability and efficiency. There are all sorts of systems that work together perfectly every day without you even noticing. In some faraway place, for example, oil is extracted from the earth using carefully engineered methods and machinery. That oil is then transported to refineries by sea, road, rail or pipeline, and finally delivered to a myriad of gas stations for your convenience. When there is chaos or dysfunction within a system, it is largely the result of human flaws. Whereas systems tend to run smoothly, human beings are inclined to make mistakes. Unsatisfactory outcomes aren’t the consequence of fate or bad luck, but rather are proof of our ability to exert our influence on processes. The global financial crisis, for example, wasn’t blind bad luck. It was the result of a series of bad decisions made by people. Moreover, our assessment as to whether systems are functioning as they should is largely subjective, since what qualifies as a “positive outcome” depends so heavily on our perspective. For example, you may personally find it scandalous that gas prices are so high. An oil-exporting nation, however, will view the situation somewhat differently. The situation, however, is not unchangeable. For instance, governments could negotiate a better resource sharing scheme that benefits everyone. You see, you’re not just a grain of sand; you have influence, and can work the system to your advantage. Nearly everyone has at some stage sunk to a point where they felt that they’d never achieve their dreams because the game is simply rigged against them. This mind-set ensures that you’ll never get the change you want! It’s true: no one person has total control over all the systems that affect her life. There’s nothing you can do about it, so just accept it and move on. While you can exercise your right to vote in a democracy, for example, the overall result will be out of your hands. Your vote is just one among many, and complaining about it does nothing to change this fact. But that doesn’t mean you should scorn democracy. After all, you can still participate, and even though your vote might not singlehandedly swing an election, that doesn’t mean you are without influence. There are, however, many systems which are under your direct command. You have only to take charge of managing them to make things work in your favor. Most things don’t go the way we want because we don’t even try to change their outcomes. Consider democracy again: If you believe that you are truly powerless, then you might stop voting. That’s definitely not going to advance your cause. Or, to take a more day-to-day example, if you want to lose weight, you won’t shed any pounds through intention alone. Leaving it to chance won’t do it either. Rather, you’ll need to develop a plan – a diet, an exercise regimen or something similar – and set it in motion. So, let go of the circumstances that are out of your hands and focus instead on the systems that you can influence. This is the hand you’ve been dealt. Start playing it. How easy is it to miss the forest for the trees? It’s too easy, in fact. And yet we so often forget the obvious solution: distance. Indeed, you can only hope to understand the systems that steer your life and your position in society by stepping back and gaining the perspective of someone on the outside looking in. A cogwheel in a machine only knows about the other cogwheels that it touches. Only by seeing the cogwheels in relation to the rest of the machinery can you hope to understand how the mechanism actually works. Similarly, we often drift through our daily routines without any awareness of the different systems that we pass through and participate in each day, which can make it difficult for us to see our own role in these systems. But once you look at them from the right vantage point, you are in a better position to dissect these systems and see their interworking parts. Every system can be broken down into subsystems, and each subsystem into multi-step processes. By breaking systems down in this way, we can deal with manageable pieces and uncover the mechanisms that cause problems. Think about it this way: your mechanic would be useless if he didn’t know that a car is made of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems, and understand that these systems work together to set the car in motion. Every system is only as good as its components, so if you can step back and see the individual parts, then you’ll have a better idea of what problems need fixing. Now that you have a better understanding of what systems are, it’s time to look at how you can apply this knowledge to improve your professional and personal life. But first we have to set some ground rules. Start by defining your objectives and corresponding strategies in detail. If you don’t know what your objectives are, it becomes impossible to make decisions, as your choices will have no clearly motivated purpose. Like a ship without a compass, you won’t be able to tell whether you are drifting further away or getting closer to your goal if you don’t have a clear idea of what that goal is supposed to be. Second, realize that today’s problems are tomorrow’s opportunities. You don’t want to get into the habit of tackling problems as they arise. You want to pull out the problems at the root, thus pre-empting future difficulties. That means identifying which problems are symptomatic of flaws in your system. Your goal as a systems manager is to make systems work more smoothly. In this way, the problems that you discover are actually opportunities to improve the functionality of your systems. For example, breaking up with your partner might seem like the obvious solution for your dysfunctional relationship. That is, until you find yourself in the exact same situation with someone else a year later. You could have instead looked at your relationship as a system and identified the cause of the problem within that system. Maybe then you could have figured out what it was about yourself or your relationship style that made your relationship dysfunctional to begin with. You can influence all the systems that you belong to, whether they’re professional, personal, financial, social or biological. In the next blink, you will learn more about how to apply this to your business. A business isn’t a monolith. Rather, it is a complex organization comprised of various interoperating systems. So how can you hope to manage such complexity? Like every system, your business can be broken down into subsystems. By delegating the supervision of departments, that is, subsystems, you save yourself valuable time that can be invested in leadership instead. The head of human resources should deal with HR, the logistics manager with logistics and so on, drawing on your instructions but not requiring your input for every single decision. How could you possibly attend every HR, logistics, or sales meeting while also plotting the strategic course that each system should be following? When you are plotting this strategic course, you will need to be specific in defining objectives and guidelines. Remember the sailboat without a compass? You don’t ever want to find yourself in that position. If you don’t plot a course, then your business has no hope of producing the outcomes you want. This is your responsibility, i.e., the responsibility of a leader: setting the strategic course that guides these interoperating systems. Early in the author’s career he had set only vague goals for his company – things like making more profit – before finally discovering business mechanics. After internalizing the systems mind-set and appreciating the different systems around him, he was able to create more specific objectives and strategies that were actually useful in assessing his progress. For example, he set the specific company goal of becoming one of the top five players in the US market by increasing quality while reducing quantity. His new approach paid off almost instantly. Most people want their business to run like a well-oiled machine. But even a rusty old machine is a good starting point. By repairing the subsystems within your business, you have an opportunity to find huge value. Dysfunctional parts of your business essentially represent hidden profits waiting to be unlocked. So how should you approach their repair? Start by tackling the biggest problems – or dysfunctional parts – first, and work your way down all the way to the tiniest details. As your problem-solving becomes more specific, you’ll need less and less time to cope with dysfunctional parts, thus ensuring that you optimize your processes and increase profits as quickly as possible. But in order for your machine to run smoothly, your workers will have to know how to manage that machine. A consistent outcome is not the product of chance, but of detailed instructions. Involve your employees in writing step-by-step guides for every process, so that tasks are always carried out in the most efficient way possible. One reason computer programs are so efficient is because they perform a process the same way every single time, following a step-by-step protocol. Use this as a guide in making your systems as consistent and predictable as possible. Once you’ve put your systems in place, you can’t forget to maintain them. Every machine needs to be oiled, serviced and tuned. Don’t make the mistake of resting on your laurels. Even the best client relationship will turn sour, for example, if you neglect to give it the necessary attention. If you manage systems in a way that prevents problems and maintains a consistent quality of outcome, you will not only make more money, but also do so more efficiently. What is the right goal? Is it getting everything right? All 100 percent? When it comes to business, we’ll have to use a different logic. Here, 98 percent is good enough. Don’t waste time and money on trying to get things 100 percent right. In fact, 98 percent could be considered perfect, as achieving that last two percent requires so much additional effort that it would render the process inefficient! For example: How much time and energy would it take you to paint the fence? And how much extra time and energy would it take to paint it perfectly, without any streaks or imperfections? And would it even be worth it? Take this into consideration when you’re determining how you will maximize the efficiency of your systems. They don’t have to be perfect; they just have to be great. In the process of achieving your near-perfect system, be sure to never stop communicating. Indeed, the communication system is omnipresent in business as well as your personal life. Misunderstandings and conflicts arise from silence. If there is a problem, address it immediately. You can take steps to institutionalize communication and dialogue in your business by providing various opportunities for one-on-one and group communication, such as meetings. Beyond business, so many problems arise from a simple lack of communication. Even conflicts as huge as the Cold War were largely a result of poor communication. And it almost led to atomic war! Conversely, states that interact regularly through shared trust improve their cooperation, as is the case in the European Union. Aim to be more like them no matter whether it’s at home with your spouse or at the office with your colleagues. The key message in this book: Hard work doesn’t automatically lead to success, especially if you waste your efforts working on the wrong things. To make the most out of your work, you have to identify the systems within which you operate, and then discern, analyze and improve the dysfunctional parts in them.

Womack","summary":"Have you ever stopped to think if your working day is as effective as it can be? Are you really doing all that you can do? Chances are you aren’t. Truth is, we are all suffering from a distinct lack of efficiency in our daily lives. For a start, just think about how much time you spend every day being interrupted by colleagues. It might seem trivial to talk about the game last night with a workmate, but do that half a dozen times and you’ve lost an hour. We are far from working at our full potential, but what can we do about it? Luckily these blinks have the answers. Read on and you will discover how to start working toward your full potential. In these blinks you’ll discover why life is a marathon not a sprint; why you should evaluate the people you work with; and how to stay motivated at every stage. Just Do It – you’re probably familiar with this catchy Nike tagline. But have you ever considered that those three words could be much more than an ad campaign? Just Do It is one of the simplest yet most valuable pieces of advice for anyone who wants to achieve any kind of goal. Read the slogan again, and this time think – what does the It mean for you? Defining exactly what you want to do will jumpstart your journey toward working smarter. Setting a clear goal takes self-honesty, which you can achieve just by standing in front of your mirror in the morning and asking yourself the following question: “If I could be better at one thing, what would that be?” Then, when you get home at the end of the day, return to the mirror and ask yourself another question: “What did I do today to bring myself closer to achieving my goal?” Let’s say your goal is to run a marathon. Did you go jogging? Take steps toward a healthier diet? This leads us to another vital aspect of setting your goals: breaking them down into smaller parts. For instance, your marathon dream may seem daunting. Why not break up your training into smaller units? You could start with 5 km, then move to 10 km, and work your way up. If you can turn your seemingly huge goal into a series of manageable tasks, taking action becomes so much easier. It’s also important that you approach your tasks one at a time. Though it’s great to be excited about achieving your goals, always be careful not to get ahead of yourself. If you’re anticipating doing too many things at once, you’ll find your energy and motivation draining away. This applies not just to tasks related to your goals, but to other distractions too. Read on to find out how you can combat this and make the most effective use of your time! What tasks did you put off today? We all postpone things on our to-do lists, promising we’ll come back to them as soon as we have a little more time, while the list only grows longer and longer. This will set you back as you chase your goals, but you can combat it by keeping good pace.  So how do you find a good pace? It’s all about balance: you shouldn’t move so fast that you run out of steam before the day’s over, nor should you go so slow that you lose motivation. If you can find the middle ground that you’re happy with, then you’ll have found your pace. And, once you’ve found it, stick to it! The author had to learn the lesson of sticking to his pace the hard way. An avid triathlete, he was running in the Wildflower Triathlon and found that he’d completed the first mile in just six minutes, though his planned pace was eight minutes per mile. Sure enough, by the five mile mark he hit the wall and had to slow down. This wouldn’t have happened if he’d kept to his pace! Keeping pace is one way to use your day more effectively. But there’s another way to make the most of the time you have. How? Simple – by valuing it! Consider this: 15 minutes is around one percent of a day. Still, it’s enough time to get a lot of things done. When the author had to wait 15 minutes for a meeting, he managed to write a thank you card, review his calendar for the coming three weeks, book his hotel and rental car for an upcoming trip, check his voicemails and briefly plan out an article. Think about that the next time you’ve got 15 minutes to spare. Inconvenient waiting times can turn into windows of opportunity to tick those little items off our to-do lists. This in turn will free up mental space for more important tasks, which is vital, as we’ll see in the following blink. You know that feeling when you’re reading a book, find your mind wandering and suddenly reach the bottom of the page with no clue about what you’ve just read? Distractions are seemingly ever-present! But if we want to get through that book, or move closer to our goals, we’ve got to fight them. Distractions often weigh upon us and keep us from focusing on the present moment, sometimes more than we realize. Once, a new executive coaching client asked the author “Where do we begin?” He responded by placing a ream of paper in front of her and asking her to write down one thing that she was thinking of on the first sheet. Then he asked her to put the sheet aside and write down the next thing she was thinking about on the following page, and so on. Nearly all of the things she wrote down were tasks she had to do, from hiring a new employee to organizing a summer camp for her daughter. After four hours, she had identified 500 things that required her attention! It’s easy to see how having so many uncompleted tasks would drain your energy and draw you away from your goals. Ticking those distractions off your to-do list is a crucial step toward working smarter. But it’s not just errands that can distract you from your goals – people can too. How much time do you spend with people that limit your thinking? Try writing a daily assessment of the people you spent the most time with and how they affected your productivity and engagement. After a couple of days you’ll see which people truly inspire you. These are the people you should try and spend at least an hour or two with each week or month. This will keep you both motivated and open-minded. We can do our best to complete everything on our to-do list, but there are still ways that we’re losing time without even realizing it. How often do you have to interrupt your work to chat to colleagues during the day, for example? Over time these interruptions add up. So how can we manage them? By tracking them, measuring them, and making a change. One of the author’s clients measured how many times he’d been interrupted by a colleague over two days: 27 times! You can imagine how this must have damaged his productivity. Having measured and realized how much time was being wasted, the client knew he had to do something about it. Try measuring your lost time for yourself, for example, by how much time you spend away from your desk, or how many times someone asks “for a minute.” You may be shocked at what you find! Keeping track of your productivity on an everyday basis is incredibly helpful, but it can’t stand alone. It’s also important that you continue to know why you do the things you do. Keep asking yourself what your true purpose is – this will keep you on the right track. A great way to evaluate your sense of purpose is by formulating some “So that...” statements. It could be things like “I work so that I can send my children to college.” You can keep these statements somewhere you’ll see them every day, to keep you inspired to achieve the things that matter. Despite what we might think, nobody can truly change all by themselves. Luckily, the world is full of people who have different perspectives that you can learn from as you work toward your goals. All you have do is ask! But first, consider the last time someone offered you constructive criticism. Was it from your boss? Your spouse? What exactly did they say? If you can’t remember, it’s probably a sign that you should listen more carefully. One way you can improve your listening skills is by seeking feedback more often, and seeking it actively. Don’t just wait for it! A great way to gain more feedback is by creating a mentor/mentee program. This is how it works: Think of someone you think could meet for weekly sessions over the next two months. During these meetings explain your current projects to your partner, listen to their feedback, and then listen to their projects and offer them feedback in turn. Feedback is a great way to ensure you’re constantly improving. But if you’re serious about growing, you’ve got to make sure you never rest on your laurels, no matter how tempting it may be! Once we’ve settled into a job or done something for a long time, we tend to get comfortable and assume we know the best way to complete our tasks. But if you want to achieve more, never let yourself get comfortable – instead, keep practicing! One way to do this is by adopting the mind-set of a beginner. Take the author’s mentor, Jim Polk, for example. Even though he’s a seasoned pilot with hundreds of flying hours, he still practises the basic lessons he did when he first learned how to fly.   The key message in this book: Setting clear goals, eliminating distractions and valuing your time will allow you to work smarter. Your ambitions will never be out of reach when you keep your focus on them and surround yourself with people who inspire you.  Actionable advice: Make the most of your waiting time!  If you’ve got a few minutes to spare, try writing a short thank-you card to a colleague, or anyone who has helped you out lately. Not only will this keep you productive, it’ll also help you focus on the present and the things that you’re thankful for – a better energy boost than any cup of coffee! So make sure you always have some postcards and stamps with you, just in case. What to read next: The Effective Executive, by Peter F. Drucker As you’ve just discovered, identifying your goals and measuring your progress is crucial to success. But what about helping others do the same? After all, leaders and managers must to do more than guarantee their own success; they have to ensure the success of those around them. In The Effective Executive, Peter F. Drucker highlights the techniques and principles that make certain managers so great.

But with the constant advances in communications technologies, we’re also increasingly surrounded by potential distractions, which means that using our brains optimally will only get more difficult. By exploring how our brains function in everyday life, Your Brain At Work provides many effective strategies for staying focused amid the noise and delivering great work under pressure. In short, the book will help you to not merely survive but to actually succeed in today’s demanding work environment. In these blinks, you’ll discover that pushing yourself to work harder when your mind is already exhausted will always lead to poor performance. You’ll learn why leaving your smartphone on and your email open while you work can actually lower your IQ. You’ll discover why it’s always better to help others reach their own insights than to give them direct feedback and instructions. You’ll find out why making yourself laugh when you’re faced with a challenging problem can actually help you to find the solution. Finally, you’ll learn how to trick your brain into being interested and alert simply by using your imagination. We all know what it’s like to “burn the midnight oil.” The later we work into the night, the less we're able to think clearly, and when we notice that our attention is waning we tell ourselves that we should simply try harder. But there’s reason to believe that you should give your brain a break instead. We use a massive amount of energy in all our interactions with the world, which fatigues our ability to think clearly. This indicates that our capacity for active thought is limited. Evidence for this limitation can be found as early as 1898, in a study where subjects were instructed to perform a mental task while putting as much physical pressure as possible on a machine that measures force (a “dynamometer”). The results revealed that, when the subjects were engaged in active thought, their maximum physical force was reduced by up to 50 percent. Furthermore, as you'd expect, performing more than one conscious process simultaneously is even more taxing. The result is that our performance quickly declines when we try to do several mental tasks at the same time. For example, one study indicated that the constant distraction of emails and phone calls reduce performance in an IQ test by 10 points, on average. This reduced mental capacity is similar to that we experience after missing a night's sleep. One explanation for this effect is that such interruptions force the brain to spend too much time in a state of alertness. So if we want to maintain a good level of performance, we have to conserve the brain's energy for only the most important tasks. This can mean prioritizing certain tasks above others. But be aware that prioritizing is itself a task that drains energy, so make sure you prioritize when your mind is alert and fresh. Another way to conserve energy is to turn tasks into routines, as these can be stored as patterns that won't require you giving your full attention to a task. In many ways, advances in modern technology have certainly made our lives easier. But the convenience they provide also comes at a great cost to our ability to focus: the ubiquity of always-on technologies, like the internet and smartphones, means that we have more potential distractions in our lives than ever before. Whenever we're distracted, our attention is diverted, and refocusing that attention takes time and effort. In fact, one study revealed that over 2 hours of office workers' time is consumed by distractions. Another study showed that we spend around 11 minutes on a task before we're distracted, and don't return to our work until 25 minutes later. And it's not only external distractions we have to deal with. There are also many internal distractions: the constant stream of thoughts that surface into consciousness and impair our focus – like wondering whether we paid the electricity bill or not. Moreover, every time we try to resist being distracted, we decrease our ability to do so. This is because self-control is a limited resource. This was demonstrated by a famous study, where participants were placed in a room, alone, with a bar of chocolate. Some of the participants were instructed to resist eating the chocolate, while others were allowed to eat it. Afterwards, they were all given a challenging mental task to perform. Those who had managed to resist eating the chocolate gave up on this mental task much sooner than those who hadn't exercised their self-control, suggesting that self-control can become fatigued simply through being used. So, how then can we maintain our focus when we're surrounded by potential distractions? Put simply, you have to prevent those distractions from seizing our attention. One way to do this is to develop the habit of “vetoing” those behaviors that distract us. This requires us to turn off all communication devices whenever we need to do any kind of active thinking. Which would you watch more intently: a once-in-a-lifetime solar eclipse that lasts only a minute, or the tree outside your window? If you're like most people, you focus better when you're faced with a tight deadline, or when you are presented with something new and interesting. That's because being alert and interested sharpens our focus. For us to be alert, our brains require exactly the right level of norepinephrine, the chemical that's triggered when we're scared. Fear activates our alertness, and alertness is a crucial part of being focused. And for our interest to be aroused, our brains need just the right amount of another chemical: dopamine. Dopamine is triggered whenever we experience something new or unexpected, which means it's an important factor in our becoming interested in something. However, for our brains to function at their peak, it's crucial that the levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain are just right: not too high, not too low. If these levels are low, our performance will be poor. If they're high, our performance suffers because we're extremely stressed. But if the levels are in the “sweet spot,” neither too high nor too low, this generates a positive level of stress which helps to focus our attention. The good news is that we have some influence over our level of arousal. If you notice that you're not sufficiently focused, you could try imagining what will happen if you miss a deadline, as this can boost your norepinephrine levels. And you could think about the rewards of doing really great work, as this can increase your dopamine levels. However, we sometimes need to lower our arousal, as too much can lead to debilitating stress. This requires reducing both the amount and the speed of the information running through our minds. So, when you feel you might become over-aroused, try writing down your thoughts to free up your mind, or take a relaxing walk as this tends to generate activity in other parts of the brain. Have you ever had to deal with a challenging problem that demanded a creative solution, but were simply unable to get past a certain point? It's very common for people to “hit a wall” in their thinking: to reach, in other words, a mental impasse. Often, the only way to break through this wall is through insight – a perfect solution that seems to suddenly appear out of nowhere, and which recombines what we already know in a brand new way. And the findings of studies support this view: we do not arrive at insights by logical reasoning, but rather we simply, and suddenly, find ourselves on the other side of the impasse. How we solve certain word puzzles demonstrates this process. Say you're presented with a series of words, and asked to come up with one word that connects the others – for instance, “pine,” “crab” and “sauce.” If you managed to find the solution to this puzzle – the correct word is “apple” – it's likely that you didn't get there by a logical progression, but rather that the correct answer appeared to you suddenly. This is how most people arrive at the solution. The reason for this is that insight depends on the unconscious mind, which frees us from the established logical thought processes that can obscure other possible solutions. Thus, an insight is more likely to arrive when you're not using your conscious mind to solve a problem. Fortunately, there are ways you can increase the chances of arriving at an insight, and thus breaking through an impasse. You could take a break from consciously thinking about the problem. For instance, you could stretch your legs or meditate and allow your mind to wander, which enables your unconscious to process the problem. Or you could voice the problem out loud, as hearing yourself speak about it often helps to observe your own thinking more clearly and objectively. Improving the way your mind works, and thus increasing your ability to focus, first requires that you're able to observe your own thinking. This process is known as mindfulness, a concept that also refers to living in the present, having a real-time awareness of our experiences, and an acceptance of what is. Although most people are able to be mindful to some extent, those who practice mindfulness and become adept at it have far more control over what they pay attention to. For instance, if you take a day off from a stressful job to spend a day at the beach with a good friend, mindfulness will help you to notice whenever your focus slips from the wonderful weather and beautiful scenery onto the pile of work you have to slog through the next day. Once you observe this tendency in your thinking, you're then able to shift your attention back to the present moment and the great day you're having. Furthermore, by practicing mindfulness regularly, you can actually alter the structure of your brain. Among the many ways to practice mindfulness is periodically focusing your attention on physical sensations and incoming stimuli – perhaps the feeling of the chair you're sitting on – just for a ten seconds or so. This is more difficult than it sounds: you'll probably notice how your attention keeps slipping away from the present moment, and your mind starts turning over the same old thoughts. However, the more you practice, the better you'll get at noticing your focus shifting from real-time awareness of your experience to the mind's distracting chatter and interpretation. Moreover, practicing mindfulness will increase the strength of those areas of your brain that handle mental control and attention switching. Like everyone else, you have the ability to make these changes, and you can do it whenever and wherever you like – while you're walking through a park, talking to a friend, or eating a meal. You just have to take the time to focus on your sensory experiences. We've all experienced uncertainty and lack of control, and the deep emotional responses they trigger. Perhaps this happens while you're waiting to hear about that job you applied for, or when you're buried under a pile of work so high that you can't possibly manage it. But why do we respond this way to uncertainty and the sense that we're not in control? The answer lies in the brain, which constantly craves certainty and autonomy. As brain scans reveal, when our need for certainty and autonomy is satisfied, we experience a strong sense of reward. It's no surprise then that entire industries are dedicated to dispelling uncertainty – like financial consulting, which provides executives with a sense of certainty by means of strategic planning and financial forecasting. In fact, scientists have shown that we feel less stressed when faced with a stress-inducing task over which we have control and autonomy than when we have to deal with a similarly stressful task without a sense of control. The strong emotional response we experience when we lack control and autonomy actually stems from our appraisal of the situation. Fortunately, we can change our appraisals and, by doing so, transform our emotional responses . This process of choosing to interpret a situation differently is called “reappraisal,” and there are many benefits to it. In fact, one study revealed that people who reappraise more experienced a higher satisfaction with life than those who choose instead to inhibit their emotions. One kind of reappraisal is humor, as it involves a shift in perspective that can transform one's experience of a situation from gravely serious to funny and lighthearted. For example, one CEO adopted the strategy of telling jokes whenever a meeting became tense, because he'd discovered that laughing at a difficult situation made it easier to find solutions. So, by reappraising you can better manage the strong emotions generated by the lack of certainty and autonomy. Have you ever become so excited over a certain prospect – say, when you truly believe you were just about to win a game of Texas Hold 'Em – that you felt terrible when it didn't transpire? Why do unmet expectations make us feel so bad? In a word: dopamine. If what transpires exceeds our expectations, our brain's dopamine levels increase, generating our interest and desire. For example, unexpected rewards, like receiving a surprise small bonus at work, have a far more positive effect on our brain chemistry than expected rewards, like receiving exactly the pay raise you had expected. On the other hand, expecting a reward, like a pay raise, but not getting it causes our dopamine levels to plunge, and this results in us feeling something very similar to pain. It follows, then, that to maintain a positive mental state we have to manage and regulate our expectations. The most effective way to do this is to get into the habit of paying attention to your expectations. This will allow you to consciously adjust and lower them, so that you enable your expectations to be exceeded. For example, imagine that you want to get upgraded to first-class on a long, international flight. If you keep your expectations low, you'll likely feel fine if you don't happen to get the upgrade and have to fly coach. But if you are upgraded, you'll feel delighted. On the other hand, if you have high expectations, and let yourself get excited about the possibility of travelling first-class, you'll be extremely disappointed if you aren't upgraded. Moreover, if you are upgraded just as you expected, you'll feel only slightly happy. We often don’t think our feelings of relatedness to others, and of fairness, are crucial to our physical survival, but, actually, they’re as important as food and water. This is because, for the brain, feeling socially connected and able to relate to others is a primary reward. In fact, as studies show, when the brain responds to our social needs it activates the same neural networks that are used for our basic survival. This indicates that our sense of relatedness to others in our society is crucial to our minute-by-minute existence. In short, for our brains, friends are as necessary to our wellbeing as food. Why is this? When we feel connected to others, able to relate our own thoughts and emotions with theirs, our brains release oxytocin, a neurochemical that produces a sense of pleasure. Dancing with other people, playing music together, or even just having a good conversation releases oxytocin. Indeed, studies have revealed that people are less responsive to stress if they have plenty of rewarding friendships. This lack of stress frees up the brain’s resources to deal with planning and thinking, and even reduces the chances of heart disease or stroke. In particular, a sense of fairness is very important to our wellbeing, as it can be even more rewarding to the brain than money. For example, one experiment called “The Ultimatum Game” showed that people will turn down offers of money if they perceive them as unfair – even when that means they walk away with nothing. This suggests that defending what we believe to be fair is so important to us that we’ll even sacrifice financial gain. What’s behind such a strong response to fairness? One possibility is that our sense of fairness emerged out of our need trade efficiently. Those who had the ability to detect fairness had an evolutionary advantage: they could identify cheaters, whose behavior could compromise the type of trading that was necessary to the survival of hunter-gatherers. If you’ve ever gotten a kick out of winning an argument, spent money on clothes from a designer fashion store, or even felt good about meeting someone worse off than yourself, you know that feeling an increase in status can trigger a sense of reward. This is because when we perceive an increase in our status, we get a positive emotional response: our dopamine and serotonin levels (chemicals essential to happiness) go up, and our cortisol levels (an indicator of stress) go down. But a sense of our increased status doesn’t just make us feel happier; it also improves our ability to think. That’s because the high levels of dopamine and serotonin increase the amount of neural connections we can make per hour, which means it takes less effort to process more information. Clearly, having a sense of high status offers a great benefit to the brain. So how can you increase your status? By finding a niche, any niche, where you can feel superior to other people – for instance, funnier, richer or more intelligent. Yet, you can even trick your brain into giving you a status reward by trying to be superior to yourself. This is possible because our self-perception uses the same neural circuitry that the brain uses when perceiving others. The benefit of this approach is that you can increase your status without offending or upsetting anyone else in the process. One way to do this is to work at improving your own skills – for instance, your golf handicap – as this provides you with the opportunity to feel a potentially ever-increasing status, without being a threat to anyone else. So, a sense of your status increasing, even by a small amount, activates the brain’s reward circuitry, and you can trigger the same kind of reward by playing against and trying to beat yourself. Have you ever tried to change another person’s thinking? We often believe the best approach is to give that person lots of feedback, but giving feedback actually doesn’t help improve performance. Instead, real change can occur only when the other person sees his errors for himself. The reason that giving feedback is so ineffective is that is tends to make people extremely anxious. In fact, as one study revealed, when people hit an impasse in their thinking, telling them what to do so they can overcome the block actually helps them only 8 percent of the time, while telling them what not to do helps just 5 percent of the time. Instead, a better approach to facilitate change in people is to try to guide them towards their own insights regarding the problem. To do this, you need to help people to get into a conducive, reflective frame of mind. This can be achieved by reducing any anxiety and increasing any positive feelings and sense of autonomy they may have. For instance, if you want to help a coworker with a particular problem, rather than ask them “Why did this go wrong? What was the problem?” you could reframe the question in a more positive way – like, “I’m sure you did your best with this. Let’s just work together and see if we can find a way to rescue the situation.” By doing this, you raise the other person’s status because you’re implying that they are capable of good ideas that are worth exploring. Another way to help others arrive at their own insights is to reward them for giving feedback to themselves. Consider, for example, the neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman’s technique: the grades he gives the work of his students are based on the skill with which they integrate their own prior criticisms into their writing. This approach actually allows the students to improve, continually. The key message in this book: It is a common misconception that, if you aren’t delivering your best work, you should simply try harder. Often, however, the brain just needs more fuel and rewards to keep going. The reason for this is that your brain gets tired and distracted easily, and is strongly rewarded by status, certainty and control. So, for your brain to work optimally, it helps to eliminate day-to-day distractions, find out ways to have more choice and autonomy in your life, and, most importantly, train your ability to reflect on your thinking. Actionable advice: Identify and eliminate distractions. Recognizing and then dismissing everyday distractions is important if you want to stay focused. So, next time you have to do work that requires active thinking, remember that your performance will benefit greatly with your mobile phone switched off and a closed email program. This way your brain won’t have to use its limited energy on thinking about the missed calls and all the accumulating unread mails. What’s more, if people learn that you only answer your mails during a limited time window, chances are they will send you only the most important mails. Lower your expectations. A good way to maintain a positive frame of mind is to actually lower your expectations just a tad. Next time you catch yourself getting overly thrilled by the thought of getting a promotion or any other kind of reward, try to push aside the urge to get too excited. This way it will be a pleasant surprise if you actually are rewarded, and won’t be as painful if you aren’t as lucky.","headers":["What’s in it for me: find out how to gain control over your brain.","Your ability to think well is a limited resource, so conserve the resource at every opportunity.","Our attention is very easily distracted, but there are strategies for staying focused.","Optimal mental performance requires just the right level of arousal of your brain.","Insights make it possible to overcome mental blocks that limit you to the same small set of solutions.","Mindfulness can help you focus by actually changing the structure of your brain.","Feelings of certainty and control are very rewarding to the brain, and you can activate these feelings yourself.","Regulating your expectations is key to a general feeling of happiness.","A feeling of relatedness to others and a sense of being treated fairly are primary rewards for the brain.","We are wired to feel rewarded for increases in our status, and can trick our brains into status rewards.","Feedback rarely creates positive change in others; instead, try helping them arrive at their own insights.","Final Summary"],"category":"Productivity","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/533ae3593430340007090000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"Your Brain At Work (2009) explores the inner workings of our brains and provides many methods for us to optimize our thinking.

The result? Over half said they would take it. But it’s not just athletes who fetishize competition. Most of us are obsessed with winning. Somehow we’ve come to think of ourselves in terms of being winners or losers. It matters a lot to us that we have the smartest child, the cutest cat, the best-performing stock portfolio, the most Facebook friends and the most awe-inspiring CV. It’s all about being the best rather than just a part of a team. As you’ll learn from these blinks, this cultural obsession with winning harms all of us, our kids and even our economy. You’ll also find out How the Finnish education system avoids competitiveness; why rewards can harm your child’s creativity; and why strenuous workouts in a rubber suit are not a good idea. What does it take to become a star athlete? Obviously, a lot of hard work and talent. But in the late nineteenth century, the psychologist Norbert Triplett discovered that competition also helps. For instance, cyclists will ride faster in a competition than in practice. However, life isn’t a bicycle race. If we think about everything in terms of winning or losing, most of us are bound to end up disappointed. After all, whenever people compete for top positions, only a handful can emerge victorious. At the London Olympic Games, a mere 8.8 percent of all competitors left with a medal. Similarly, only a small fraction of society is a member of the economic elite. In other words, most competitors end up losing, regardless of how hard they try. So, if we define the purpose of life as competition, most of us will fail and end up miserable. But that’s not the only downside to competition. It’s also detrimental to our health and can be a major source of stress. If we always feel the need to be the absolute best and can’t rely on others because we see them as competition, our only option is to do everything by ourselves. It’s easy to see how this can lead to overwork and losing sleep. Simply believing that life is a competition and that everyone is against us will cause our stress levels to spike. And all of this sets us up to burn out. Furthermore, highly competitive people often take unnecessary risks. For example, to make their weight class, some wrestlers do high-intensity workouts while wearing rubber suits. This induces profuse sweating and can lead to death from heat stroke. And finally, competition can discourage people from doing things that are good for them. If we believe that an activity, like sports, is only about winning and we feel that we can’t win, we’ll simply avoid it altogether, even though it might have other benefits. Did you ever participate in a spelling bee or similar competition when you were young? If you did, you probably enjoyed it. Chances are you were so eager to master all your vocabulary lists that you even studied a bit harder. But in many schools, competition goes far beyond these harmless games. Students are ranked based on performance with the assumption that the competitive format will make them work harder. However, when competition is used to constantly compare peers, it ceases to be a game. In cases like this, education becomes a matter of winning or losing. And when schools put so much emphasis on competition, students learn to depend on it as their sole source of motivation. They study as hard as they can to raise their class rank and perform better than the person sitting next to them. But external motivations like competition or praise weaken a student’s intrinsic motivation – the motivation he derives from internal rewards. With intrinsic motivation, a student studies for his science test simply because he’s fascinated by bugs, or devotes himself to painting because he loves it. Intrinsic motivation is the only type of motivation that will keep students continually learning once the competition and praise disappear. It is also a driving force for creativity, as only intrinsically motivated students will be keen to try new and innovative things. Furthermore, if a student is a low performer anyhow, it’s unlikely that competition will affect his drive to study. Competition can’t motivate all students, and some will simply resort to cheating. After all, why would you study your butt off to raise your rank from 28 to 25? On the other hand, such students can excel if they’re intrinsically motivated, say by the joy of learning a new skill. This will make them less likely to rely on cheating, which is key because, according to Rushworth Kidder, the founder of the Institute for Global Ethics, 75 percent of students have cheated by the time they reach university. Do you have brothers or sisters? If so, you’re probably familiar with sibling rivalry. After all, it’s normal for siblings to compete. But competition between siblings can be disastrous for family relationships. This is a major issue since parents tend to play one child against the other. They do this because it can help kids score huge achievements or make them behave better. But when siblings feel they’re in competition for their parents’ approval and affection, they become less generous and more mistrusting of one another. For instance, what if you love your cute baby sister but feel like you’re in competition with her for your father’s attention. Your envy of her will prevent you from being as loving and caring as you would normally be. And it’s not just siblings; the same thing goes for all other relationships. If you act too competitively, you’ll begin to see relationships solely in terms of comparison and performance. Say you just started dating someone. This should be an exciting and romantic experience where you’d enjoy getting to know the other person. But if your competitive impulse is so deeply ingrained that you think of dating as a competition for the best partners, you’ll see your date as a mere trophy rather than as a person. This will turn the time you spend with them into a performance to win their favor, instead of an opportunity to enjoy your intimacy. Worse, some established relationships develop an unhealthy rivalry between partners. This sets you up for disaster: marriage therapist Emily Brown says that cheating is nearly always caused by a power struggle, with the defeated partner taking revenge through infidelity. So, competition is deadly for relationships. But as you’ll see in the next blink, it gets even worse. If you could boil sports down to their essentials, what are they really about? Playing fair? Building community? The answer today is none of the above. That’s because nowadays the main focus of sports is winning and competition. This ethos has spread far and wide. So, what’s so bad about this? Well, one problem with competition is that it prevents cooperation, sharing and mutual support. After all, if you think of the people around you as your competition, you’ll always feel that in order for you to win, everyone else needs to lose. As a result, you’ll hesitate to help others or share ideas. For example, since scientists have to compete with one another for grants, jobs and priority, they see science as a competition and not a collaborative effort. That means they keep their discoveries and ideas to themselves for fear that a peer will take credit for their work. In the same way, if you feel your blog is in a popularity contest, you might hesitate to link to another blogger’s superb article because it could help them attract more followers than you. But the truth is, most situations aren’t simple competitions, and often cooperation and mutual support are far better strategies. If you do link your blog to the other one, everyone will benefit: your readers will thank you for the interesting article, the other blog will get more traffic and the blog’s author will discover your blog, possibly recommending it to his readers and expanding your audience. Nowhere is collaboration more important than in the field of science, where progress depends on the sharing and discussion of ideas. Even Albert Einstein relied on the help of a mathematician friend named Marcel Grossmann to choose the correct mathematical models when developing his general theory of relativity. Next, we’ll explore how competition is also detrimental to the economy. We all know that free market economics require companies to compete for customers. But it turns out that this may not be a good thing. To cope with a competitive environment, companies work to become as big as possible by expanding through mergers and acquisitions. After all, once they’ve swallowed up some of the competition, they’re in a better place to influence prices. Not just that, but a bigger company is more respected and can exercise greater political clout. However, this often results in serious issues. For instance, when BP expanded by buying the oil companies Amoco, Richfield and Castrol, it had to go into massive debt. Then, to recoup this money, the management slashed costs by investing less in the maintenance of certain old refineries. In 2005, these cuts caused an explosion at their Texas City refinery, which killed 15 people and injured another 180. And this intense corporate growth causes other issues for the public too. The massive corporations and banks become too big to fail, meaning that so much of a nation’s economy depends on them that the government is willing to pay huge sums of money to prevent their collapse. From a banker’s perspective, this is wildly advantageous. After all, if they know the government will save them, they can make all the risky investments they want. But for the public, it means billions of tax dollars are spent to save private corporations. But surely one benefit of competition is that it lowers prices as companies engage in price wars? Not necessarily. In fact, there too the outcome tends to be negative, because companies pass many costs onto society. For instance, some companies pay their employees such low wages that they need to rely on governmental support for survival. And when meat producers compete to slash prices, the living conditions of their livestock deteriorate. This leads to pigs and cows living in narrow sheds or overcrowded feedlots, causing great suffering. In short, outlandish growth is dangerous; competition drives this need for perpetual growth, causing market disruptions, corruption and a worse economy in general. But don’t worry, there’s a solution. We’ve seen that competition can cause serious damage, but obviously, it’s not all bad. When used appropriately, it can even be good source of added motivation. Unfortunately, society favors aggressive competition over productive collaboration, whether in the economy, our schools or our families. Luckily, we have the power to change it. First, employee ownership and horizontal hierarchies can boost cooperation and deter competition among companies. If all your employees share the same goals, this will promote cooperation. So, give every employee stock in the company, and they’ll all share the goal of generating profit. Flat hierarchies can also help. Without the distinction between superior and inferior positions, it’s no longer possible to compete to reach the top. But that’s not all that horizontal hierarchies can change. The company W. L. Gore & Associates, famous for making Gore-Tex material, uses a horizontal hierarchy model. Work isn’t controlled by managers and people don’t have to follow strict orders or work on a specific team. If they want someone to work with them on a project, they only need to convince them. In other words, they need to make their colleagues want to work with them, which fosters collaboration. In the field of education, Finland is a great model for lessening competition. Finnish schools don’t use grades or standardized tests. Instead, students get assessed based on their individual progress and are never compared to their classmates. As a result, they compete much less. Nonetheless, Finland is always in the top scoring group for the international scholastic achievement survey, PISA. It seems that students can be powerfully motivated without resorting to competition. So, a bit of competition can be fun, but in general, we’ll all do better if we shift our cultural focus away from competition and onto collaboration. The key message in this book: From the living room to the board room, competition drives our culture. But instead of producing more wealth, creativity and progress, competition has meant exactly the opposite. It’s holding us back as a society and it’s time we adopted a more collaborative system – for all our sakes.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s the diehard fans in the stands, the dedicated players on the field or the grizzled old-school coach pacing the sidelines, the people who live and breathe sports tend to project a certain message – that success in the game rests on grit, determination and raw talent. But that’s changing. Today’s top clubs are increasingly embracing something we don’t usually associate with sports – math. Take it from the Houston Astros, a baseball outfit whose meteoric rise from mid-table mediocrity to World Series champion was driven by a managerial revolution. At its heart were two forward-thinking innovators, Californian data analyst Sig Mejdal and scout Jeff Luhnow, both of whom realized that baseball, like other games, can be understood statistically. In the face of opposition from skeptics and proponents of good old “gut instinct,” Mejdal and Luhnow started following the data. The results were stunning. Soon enough, the Astros were gaming the market and signing overlooked talents whose unique skill sets laid the foundations for the club’s title-winning season in 2017. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how technology is reshaping American baseball; why the most successful clubs champion inclusivity; and what big data sometimes misses. In the late 1980s, Sig Mejdal, a Californian student and future NASA engineer, was paying his way through college by working night shifts at a casino. It was at the blackjack tables that he noticed something important: gamers usually trust their gut over reason. Blackjack is a game of probability. The player’s aim is to beat the dealer’s hand without his own hand exceeding 21. Despite the superstitions of players, there’s always a statistically preferable option when it comes to choosing to draw another card. Say a player has a hand amounting to 16. In most cases, he’ll be wary about drawing another card. After all, the chance of going bust – getting more than 21 – is pretty high, right? Well, yes, but there’s more to it. In fact, reason tells us the best move is to take another card. There’s a 74-percent chance the dealer has a winning hand of at least 17. Draw another card, however, and the player’s chance of defeat drops to 67.5 percent! That got Mejdal thinking. What, he wondered, would happen if you applied the same logic to other games. He started looking more closely at baseball. His hypothesis? Since it’s a game just like any other, math might be more reliable than gut instinct. It was an insight that paid dividends in one area in particular: player recruitment. Mejdal proved this in 2005 during his stint as an advisor to Jeff Luhnow, the scouting director at the Missouri-based St. Louis Cardinals. Mejdal’s data on player performance metrics told him that the best college player in the United States was Jed Lowrie of the Stanford Cardinals. Scouts had – literally – overlooked Lowrie because of his slight stature. Their gut instincts told them he was simply too small and slender to make it as a major league player. Luhnow, however, decided to follow Mejdal’s advice and take a gamble on Lowrie, recruiting him to the Cardinals team. The result? Lowrie went on to become an all-star player with a relatively dependable batting average of .262 in 2018 in addition to his high skills as a defensive player in the shortstop position! In 2012, scout Jeff Luhnow and his analyst Sig Mejdal were recruited by the Houston Astros. It wasn’t long before the duo started shaking things up. Thanks to technological advancements, compiling previously unimaginably detailed performance metrics was now a breeze, letting the team make smarter recruiting decisions. Take the video camera system PITCHf/x, which started being used in all major league baseball games in 2006. By triangulating between three fixed cameras, the system can calculate everything from the speed the ball is pitched at to the point it’s thrown from, as well as how strong its spin is and where it crosses the batting plate. The Astros put all that data to good use when they recruited pitcher Collin McHugh from the Colorado Rockies in 2013. McHugh’s overall performance metrics were pretty average, but PITCHf/x showed that he had an ace up his sleeve – he occasionally threw extraordinary curveballs with more than 2,000 revolutions per minute, way more than the average of 1,500. The Astros gambled that McHugh would become a more consistent player and put him on the team. The result? He went on to become one of their best pitchers. Sig Mejdal was meanwhile developing complex algorithms to support player-selection decisions. His team of analysts compiled a database of player metrics based on information gathered by the Astros’ scouts on potential recruits’ health history, individual performance, playing style and personality. What Mejdal wanted to find out was whether the scouts’ evaluations were reliable. He realized that comparing their ratings to the players’ actual performances was a great way of weeding out decisions based on prejudice or bias. Do that, Mejdal showed, and you’d be able to craft a more objective recruitment policy geared toward finding players who were most likely to become high performers. As you can imagine, this newfangled approach didn’t go down well with traditional scouts who’d long been used to relying on their instincts to pick players. But despite the doubts of naysayers, it worked. Mejdal’s system was key to the Astros’ 2017 World Series title. His recommendations helped build a team that racked up 101 wins and only 61 losses in 2017. In mid-2012, the Astros’ public relations office prepared biographies of the high school players the team regarded as likely recruits. But when the selections were made, there were quite a few surprises. The reason? Scouting duo Jeff Luhnow and Sig Mejdal’s unique approach. Let’s start with the question of age. Most baseball buffs thought the Astros would pick Byron Buxton, a player who’d already made a name for himself and proved his talents. Luhnow, however, wasn’t having any of it and instead plumped for someone with a much more low-key profile: Carlos Correa. Correa, a defensive fielding specialist like Buxton, had shown promise, but his performance stats were solid rather than outstanding. Plenty of scouts would have been turned off by that, but Sig Mejdal had seen something others hadn’t – his algorithms, which gave Correa top marks thanks to his strong defensive performances. Then there was the question of age. Correa was just shy of 18 when the Astros signed him, a good nine months younger than Buxton. Mejdal’s data showed that every month in age difference matters to players’ – and their teams’ – long-term prospects. Signing top talent young can make all the difference. It was another insight that paid dividends. While Buxton’s performance with the Minnesota Twins peaked between 2013 and 2014 before dipping in 2015, Correa simply got better and better. Picking young talents who have their best years ahead of them is also a financially savvy move. Simply put, they earn a lot less than experienced players. That’s a boon in baseball, a sport that strictly regulates expenditure on new signings and caps it at a certain sum per every ten new players. This system means that a team’s first new signing – in this case, Correa – typically gets the largest slice of the pie, limiting how much can be spent on other players. But since he was young and inexperienced, that didn’t apply to Correa. In fact, the Astros landed their new fielder by promising him a draft bonus of $4.8 million – much less than the expected $7.2 million. The upshot? The Astros filled a key position and had enough spare change to recruit top players for other positions! Baseball, like lots of games, is a sentimental affair. Just ask the Astros’ scouting director, Jeff Luhnow. Every season, he receives letters and emails from young fans begging him to hire or not hire their favorite players. There’s nothing wrong with emotion in sports – after all, we play and watch games because we love them. But sound recruitment policy requires a more hardheaded approach. The reason is simple. Relying on data rather than sentiment or instinct produces better results. That’s something the Astros know all about. In 2006, long before Sig Mejdal’s brought his algorithms to the Astros, the team already struck gold by relying on data. They found José Altuve, a Venezuelan defensive fielder known to his teammates as “the midget” due to his small size. Altuve was by all accounts a talented player and had already tried out for several major teams. But his stature was a problem. After each tryout, he’d inevitably be sent home after being told that a five-foot-five player would never make it in the major league. That changed when he tried out for the Astros. The team’s scouts and algorithm were impressed by Altuve’s speed. He was definitely small, but he could cover a lot of ground – 60 yards in just 6.31 seconds, to be precise. He was also a talented batter, hitting virtually every ball that came his way despite the common prejudice that smaller players have trouble doing just that. The team believed the figures and signed Altuve, who received a small draft bonus of $15,000 and – more importantly – an opportunity to play in one of the Astros’ affiliated minor league teams. He didn’t disappoint. By 2011, he had an impressive batting average of .327 and was asked to join the Astros in the major league. It was another triumph for data-driven scouting. Altuve was aggressive, swinging at 55 percent of all pitches, but better yet, he hit a whopping 88 percent of them – more, in other words, than top sluggers like Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero! Traditional recruitment methods would have missed this extraordinarily talented, pint-sized baseball player. But it wasn’t just the Astros who benefitted. Altuve’s performance was so impressive that he was soon offered $12.5 million to stay on and play for the team over the next four seasons. Top athletes often earn more money in a week than most people do in an entire year, to say nothing of the head-turning bonuses that come their way when they’re successful. But being a professional sportsman isn’t just about laughing all the way to the bank. In fact, the athletic trade is a uniquely vulnerable one due to the threat of injuries. Pre-existing health issues sometimes finish off careers before they’ve even really started. Take it from Brady Aiken, a young player drafted by the Astros. When Aiken arrived in Houston for his medical examination, he was on the verge of fame and fortune. A few tests later, however, and his dream had been shattered. The examiners discovered a weak ulnar collateral ligament in his arm – a ligament placed under high stress in baseball. The risk of it rupturing was too great and Aiken was sent home. It was a tough call, but it had to be made despite the fact that the Astros’ scouts loved the way Aiken played. But the Astros couldn’t simply turn Aiken away. Getting out of their agreement with him without losing a ton of money required plenty of savvy. Why? Well, if this happened, Aiken was entitled to compensation for his loss. That would have amounted to 40 percent of his signing bonus value. And for Aiken, that bonus was worth $7.9 million, meaning Aiken stood to receive a cool $3.1 million. The Astros gambled – correctly, as it turned out – that Aiken would reject this offer of compensation. After all, what he wanted wasn’t just money; he wanted to play baseball. As long as he didn’t take the compensation, there was a chance another team would recruit him. If that happened, the Astros would receive a transfer fee, thus freeing up resources for a different player. It was the right decision for the Astros. In 2015, Aiken’s ulnar collateral ligament ruptured during a game for the Florida-based IMG Baseball Academy, just as the Astros’ medics had predicted. Aiken was later drafted by the Cleveland Indians, but his injury held him back. Meanwhile, the Astros recruited Alex Bregman in Aiken’s stead, a new player who would become a core component of their team. What makes the greatest athletes, well, great? They improve with age, taking their natural talent and complementing it with their growing experience of the game. Baseball is no exception. Every player hopes for constant growth and development. But not all careers pan out that way. Sometimes players start to plateau. Take JD Martinez, a batter from Florida selected by the Astros in the twentieth round of the 2009 draft. Once he had his foot in the door of the minor leagues, he started to shine. Within two years, he’d been selected for the major league team. By 2012, he was one of the best players in a struggling Astros team and their most consistent point-winning batter. A year later, however, things started slowing down. Martinez’s stats began to suffer. His batting average declined to .251 and he hit a paltry 24 home runs over the season. What was going on? As the team’s hitting coach John Mallee noted, Martinez was stagnating. If he really wanted to become a great player, he had to make changes. Carry on the same way for much longer, Mallee warned, and he’d fall off the map of US baseball entirely. Martinez followed Mallee’s advice and decided to work on improving his game. When he sprained his wrist just a few weeks later, he took advantage of his time off the playing field to watch some of the world’s best sluggers from the stands. Few players were better than the Milwaukee Brewers’ Ryan Braun. Watching Braun hitting balls out of the park, Martinez noticed that his swinging style didn’t match Braun’s. Whereas he swung his bat downward, Braun – like other top talents – had a tendency to swing upwards so that the bat’s finishing position was higher. Once his wrist had healed up, Martinez headed to California for a couple of months of intensive training with specialist batting coaches. By the time he reappeared on the field in 2014, his batting average was up to .312. Unluckily for him, however, the Astros remained unconvinced and fired him. That was their mistake. When Martinez moved on to the Detroit Tigers, he upped his average to .444 and became the player of the month in June 2014. Most major league baseball players belong to two broad groups – those whose first language is English and those whose mother tongue is Spanish. The division between them might be invisible in most locker rooms, but it’s there all the same. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, clubs that overcome the linguistic divide often develop a much stronger team spirit. Take Carlos Beltrán, a Puerto Rican player who didn’t speak a word of English when he first joined the American baseball leagues in 1998. It wasn’t just language that posed a problem, however; racial prejudice also prevented bonds between Caucasian and Hispanic players. That left a lasting impression on Beltrán. When, between 2016 and 2017, he played for the Astros as a veteran 40-year-old player, he was determined to help create the kind of inclusive atmosphere at the club that had been missing earlier on in his career. That was easier said than done, but Beltrán found an ally in Alex Bregman, a Caucasian player who’d been with the Astros since 2015. Bregman claimed that he spoke perfect Spanish. That turned out to be a white lie, but there was no doubting that he genuinely wanted to get to know the team’s Hispanic players, including stars like Altuve and Correa. His enthusiasm was so great that soon enough other players joined in, making efforts to improve their English or Spanish skills. As the linguistic boundaries dissolved, a new team spirit began to take shape. That was great for the Astros’ sporting performance. After all, many of the team’s top performers were like Yuli Gurriel, a talented Cuban first baseman who didn’t speak a word of English when he moved to Houston in 2016. Bregman again took the lead, making sure to chat to Gurriel in Spanish and help the new signee fit in socially. Between them, Beltrán and Bregman created a sense of inclusion that boosted the team’s performance on the field. And 2017 ended up being the club’s most successful season ever, with a total of 101 wins. Data and sophisticated algorithms helped the Astros become one of the best baseball teams in the American Major League. But the club’s success wasn’t merely driven by tech. Data might be able to do a lot, but it’s worth remembering that it can’t do everything. One area in which it sometimes comes up short is player valuations. Take an example from 2017. The Astros had the opportunity to sign Justin Verlander, one of the best pitchers in the country. Great news, right? Well, there was a catch – he would cost the club $40 million for two seasons. Sig Mejdal’s algorithm suggested the deal wasn’t worth it. What it failed to pick up on, however, was the changing economic climate in the major league. Prices were rising everywhere, and fast. Star players like David Price and Zack Greinke were making $30 million a year on four-year contracts. Put into perspective, Verlander actually looked like a pretty good deal. For less than the cost of many other players, the Astros would get one of the most celebrated pitchers of all time. Jeff Luhnow, the club’s sporting director, had made plenty of decisions based on Mejdal’s data, but this time he overruled the algorithm and moved to sign Verlander. It wasn’t a bad call. Today, he’s a seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star player! Another aspect the algorithm missed was the possibility that Verlander, who seemed to be at the top of his game, might continue improving. That’s not surprising because future performance is generally something that is tricky to forecast accurately based on past performance. Top players are hard to put a price tag on since they’re so adaptable and their playing styles keep changing. How, for example, is an algorithm supposed to predict the fact that Verlander’s signature sliding pitch would be undermined by new, higher velocity balls, or that he’d respond to that change by once again upping his game and crafting a new technique? Statistics, data and mathematics already play a massive role in major league baseball and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. And teams like the Astros have shown what can be achieved when you put your trust in data rather than gut instinct. But it’s worth remembering that there’s still plenty of space for a more human touch. The key message in these blinks: When it comes to selecting players for a baseball team, gut instinct has been overvalued, leading to drafting decisions that are often prejudiced. Focusing on data as the base for most scouting decisions is a much sounder approach, even if exceptional circumstances might sometimes force scouting directors to ignore the data and follow their own instincts.

Worline and Jane E. Dutton","summary":"Overworked and disillusioned? Depressed and sick of the rat race? Are your coworkers eyeing the clock as the end of the day approaches? Do you hear constant chatter of quitting for pastures new? We all know what a poor company workplace looks, feels and sounds like. But it doesn’t have to be that way. If you’re working or managing eight hours a day, five days a week, then that time in the office ought not to feel like a massive waste. Employees who are satisfied will work harder and be more efficient – and they’re also much more likely to stay put. In turn, companies will profit from higher productivity and lower turnover. This is where compassion comes in. Businesses can be places where genuine camaraderie thrives; they can be workplaces where “solidarity” and “empathy” are not foreign concepts, but rather a key part of the business dynamic. Compassionate workplaces are the best workplaces. In these blinks, you’ll learn how giving away hospital treatments for free earned more in the long run; what Hurricane Sandy has to do with compassionate workplaces; and the benefits for a business of a roving “support pod.” If you’re one of the many people who leave home to go to work each day, you know that, more often than not, putting up with nonsense and stress is just part of the job. Suffering through stress is such a common issue at work, it’s easy to forget that it’s a real problem. It’s sad, but work can cause people to suffer unnecessarily. Patty offers just such an example. The authors met her while they were conducting research on the role of compassion in the workplace. Patty was an executive assistant who worked for several managers within a company. She loved her work and was particularly good at developing strong connections with her managers. She simply understood them and knew how to anticipate their needs. Then, the company decided to restructure, and a series of key tasks were randomly distributed among the company’s various executive assistants. Patty got the message about the change late on a Friday evening, and on Monday morning she had already been relocated to a remote building. Patty quickly found herself isolated and dispirited. To top it off, her prime skill of relationship building with the managers couldn’t be exercised anymore. This just goes to show that some management styles will cause unnecessary suffering when the impact on the employees isn’t taken into consideration. But some companies can and do minimize employees’ suffering – the answer lies in compassionate leadership. During their research, the authors met a company leader called Andy. One day, during a meeting, he’d noticed that one of his best employees, Xian, was looking particularly despondent. So he asked Xian what was up. Xian explained that his sister had died in an accident in China. But even though he was grieving, Xian had decided to still come to work. In his position as a leader, Andy had to decide how to respect Xian’s personal life within a professional setting. He opted for compassion. Xian was told he could take whatever time off he needed and would be encouraged to speak with Andy any time he felt it was necessary. Andy even invited Xian to spend time at his home and meet his family. This compassionate approach worked, and Xian was able to manage his grief successfully. Business people are tough and tend to take hard-nosed approaches. But sometimes, showing compassion to workers isn't just good for them as individuals; the business can ultimately reap the benefits. Simply put, companies that value compassion will perform better. In 2004, administrative science expert Kim Cameron published his research on the effects of what he termed virtuousness on business revenues. Cameron found that workplaces that were more compassionate were more productive. And, of course, more productive workers meant that companies finances were healthier. What’s more, his research showed that compassionate companies were better at retaining both clients and employees. Studies like Cameron’s are rare. But his work has been verified by research in related fields. These, too, indicated the power of compassion. A Gallup poll, conducted soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, confirmed the essential place of compassion within a business. It showed that companies that were compassionate saw employees’ motivation and engagement levels rise sharply. Workers across the country had been affected by the attacks, and the companies that understood this fared better. The companies that just wanted business to go on as usual soon found their employees disengaging, and in some cases even harming the work environment. Another benefit to compassion is that it’s actually a potential source of innovation. Let’s look at the work of Dr. Govindappa Venkataswamy. He established an eye clinic in Southern India in 1977. His mission was to provide high-quality eye care, and he wanted to do it for large numbers of patients. The business model he developed was remarkably simple: the patients would pay what they could afford. From one clinic, he was able to establish a whole franchise of Aravind Eye hospitals. By 2011, these hospitals were treating 7000 patients every day, and one-third of the treatments were performed pro bono. In spite of the fact that the Aravind Eye hospitals were treating of much of their clientele for free, they remained profitable. That was because high-quality treatments continued to attract wealthier clients who could pay more, as well as the poorer patients. Aravind Eye hospitals have received a lot of attention in the international press. Maybe other companies could be inspired by them and thus mirror their innovative model built on the power of compassion. This all demonstrates that a company will benefit if compassion is shown to customers and to employees. So let’s dig down and come to grips with what compassion actually involves. The first stage involves the ability to perceive when someone is suffering. But noticing suffering at work isn’t always as easy as you might think. So how do you actually set about doing so? After all, employees are hardly going to declare their problems to their employers at the top of their lungs. The authors interviewed one employee, Dorothy, who was working for an insurance company. At the time, her husband was in hospital because of kidney failure – but she hadn’t told anyone about it. Instead, she started missing days at work, which was totally out of character. She soon found herself in danger of losing her job entirely because she was out of the office so frequently. The problem was that Dorothy was ashamed she needed to take time off. Her logic was that she might lose her job if she started requesting leaves of absence. This is exactly the sort of scenario when employers need to be aware of what’s going on. Dorothy went to her boss Sandeep, and told him that she didn’t know what to do. But Sandeep had already noticed Dorothy’s unusual absences. He could see she was flushed with embarrassment and was clearly exhausted. Sandeep did the right thing. Instead of chastising her for missing so much time, he suggested Dorothy tell him exactly what the situation was, and why she hadn’t quite been her top-performing self in the previous few weeks. The vital tools that are needed when you're becoming compassionate in business are inquiry and curiosity. They’ll make it easier for you to spot suffering. The truth is, when we see erratic behavior, we’re often far too quick to reach conclusions that, frankly, aren’t very compassionate. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Organizational researcher Reut Livne-Tarandach conducted a field study in camps for children whose parents had cancer. She discovered that it was essential for camp counselors to be curious about the children, and to regularly ask about their feelings. Crucially, she found that the camps that trained the counselors to inquire gently had less conflict between campers and counselors than those that didn’t. The point is that company managers and leaders can use similar techniques and styles of inquiry to learn more about their employees’ feelings, and thus prevent suffering in the workplace. The business world can be a lively, inventive and progressive place. But, unfortunately, some of its clichés can be pretty harmful too. You often hear people spout nonsense like, “Work is incompatible with a personal life,” or “When at work, you’re there only to work.” But attitudes like this will only cause suffering in the long run, because they portray suffering as something you just have to put up with. Generally speaking, suffering is “rationalized” in three different ways. These interpretations are harmful because they perpetuate the notion that compassion is an emotion with no role in the workplace. So, what are these dangerous rationalizations? Researchers have a term for rapid interpretations: appraisals. Such appraisals occur at lightning speed – we don’t even register that we’re making them. If you judge someone responsible for their own suffering, that’s an example of the first type of appraisal. Just think back to the last time you blamed someone for a mess he had got himself into. You had shut down compassion before you had even had a chance to empathize. The second type of appraisal occurs when you decide that someone doesn’t deserve your concern – and just like that, compassion is gone. For instance, homeless people are often considered undeserving by society at large because they don’t work. Finally, the third appraisal that shuts down compassion occurs when you think you don’t have the energy or resources to help. It’s fairly common for people to, for example, ignore someone asking for directions in the street under the pretense that there’s simply no time to stop. If there’s a lesson to be learned from the human habit of snap appraisal-making, it’s that blame should be withheld. If you’re slow in passing judgment as a matter of habit, then workplaces will become more compassionate. If someone shows up late for work, or someone else makes a bad call during a business transaction, there’s no need to bring the hammer down upon them. Instead of blaming them immediately, pause, and look for the root causes of poor performance. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York, companies generally took two approaches when employees were late, absent or made mistakes. Some companies were clear that they still considered them good employees and understood that they were still dealing with the impact of the hurricane on properties and infrastructure; other companies, however, blamed the employees, and even started accusing them of using the hurricane as an excuse to slack off. Before too long, compassion levels in these workplaces dropped to new lows. Snap appraisals that lead to blame and compassionate workplaces simply can’t coexist. Empathy is a tricky feeling. It’s not some emotion that emerges from nowhere, completely unprompted – we actually have to put a lot of effort in. That’s because while empathy is a deep-seated and innate emotion, there are various ways it can be blocked. Over the last 20 years, numerous neuroscience studies have demonstrated that we humans are not driven by pure self-interest alone; as it turns out, the brain is wired for empathy. Practically, this means that we’re able to pick up on very subtle facial and vocal cues. From those signals, we can recognize if someone is suffering and, in turn, react supportively or offer help. Unfortunately, this potential for empathy can quickly be cast aside, and this often occurs in work situations. Imagine someone at work gets unfairly blamed for a mistake. Often, colleagues won’t say anything, because they think they may well have to shoulder some of the blame if they so much as associate with the person at fault. In other words, if empathy could cost us, we often prefer to suppress it; we may even fall back on hostile feelings to cover it up. Generally speaking, we usually end up blocking empathy if we fail to relate to other people’s perspectives. You can get over this if you deliberately try to imagine yourself in someone else’s shoes and try to work out the best way you could help them through the situation in question. This is known as cognitive empathy. Think of it as a contrast to emotional empathy, when you’re only trying to understand someone’s feelings. Let’s look at an example. The authors went to a law firm while conducting their research into empathy. One of the copy clerks, Juana, was feeling down. She had always dreamed of becoming a paralegal, but she was getting nowhere; photocopying piles upon piles of documents every day was hardly moving her in the right direction. Stuck in this dead-end job and bored stiff, she started making mistakes. Before too long, one of her bosses, a paralegal named Rosita, came down heavily on Juana, and said she was sick of her constant lapses and errors. Luckily, the staff manager, Veronica, intervened. She invited Rosita to imagine the situation from Juana’s perspective. This way, Veronica found a way for Rosita to recover her empathy, and Rosita could now come at it from Juana’s perspective – she realized that she needed to find ways to support Juana. Only that way could Juana one day work her way up to becoming a paralegal, and fulfilling her true potential. Sometimes having empathy isn’t enough – you often need to show it in the moment. In the end, empathy is not a feeling that should percolate over months. This means that if you’re going to successfully display your empathy, you’ll have to imagine yourself as a kind of jazz musician: you’re going to have to improvise! Practically speaking, if you know you’re not the best at reacting to information in real time, you’ll have to consider your compassionate options for action ahead of when it might be needed. Ultimately, however, remember that if compassion is real, it should lead to action. Let’s look at Nazima. Nazima was very close to her sister Chenni and to Chenni’s daughter Faith, who had Down’s syndrome. One day, Chenni called Nazima in tears. Faith had died. Nazima was a key worker in her firm and was in the midst of preparing for a very important board meeting. However, it quickly became clear to Nazima that she wouldn't be able to attend, even though it would put her coworkers under a lot of strain. Luckily, Nazima had the support of an empathetic colleague, Ed. He was ready and willing to step in. As it happens, being flexible enough to allow colleagues to take time off when they’re suffering is a prime example of empathetic action. But it’s not just about the big actions; when it comes to showing empathy, small gestures can be just as important. If someone is suffering, just being there, attentive and available to listen, will show that you’re compassionate. In Nazima’s case, Ed was sure to ask her each day how she was doing. But, of course, this sort of behavior must be adapted to the wishes of the person who is suffering. It may feel like you’re pressuring them, and some people simply need to be left alone at such times. Ed did the right thing. He sent a daily email or left a phone message with Nazima, just to let her know that all was well. And then, whenever she expressed the need to talk, they had a conversation over the phone. These regular occasions for making contact ensured that Ed’s feelings of empathy were strong. In fact, it made it easier for him to work out what kind of support she needed. And Nazima benefited too. Without Ed’s support, she would have had a far harder time at work while grieving the loss of her niece. Examples like this go to show that compassion and empathy aren’t just a friendly smile – you really have to work on turning that compassion into action. It’s one thing for an individual to work on becoming more compassionate, but it’s quite another to change an entire company’s culture. It may be tough, but it can be done. Once, during a trip as organizational researchers, the authors visited Midwest Billing, a company based out of Omaha, Nebraska. Midwest Billing does the paperwork for the area’s hospitals. Its employees are mostly women and there are few opportunities for promotion. What’s interesting is that the company is extremely efficient and profitable, and the work atmosphere is immensely compassionate. One Monday morning when the authors were visiting, an employee called Dorothy was faced with a massive amount of mail piled up on her desk. The material was all pretty similar, mostly updates about submitted insurance claims. But, when the other women came into work, chatting away and coffees in hand, they immediately clued into Dorothy’s situation. They put down their drinks and shimmied over to help Dorothy go through the letters. It took a good half hour with all of them working on the letters, but when it was over, all the updates had been sorted and filed. What could have been hours of mind-numbing work for Dorothy had been settled in the blink of an eye, thanks to her colleagues and their compassionate actions. But communal compassion doesn’t emerge out of nowhere – it often takes a fair amount of active encouragement on the part of companies. Midwest Billings had achieved this compassion through the creation of subunits, like the one Dorothy was working in. These smaller teams made it easier for workers to get to know each other personally and develop a culture of solidarity. This strategy also had consequences for new staff hires. The company put a great deal of energy into finding people who would fit into an existing group. It wasn’t just about whether a new employee had organizational skills, for instance – they had to have a real personal spark. Furthermore, Midwest Billings set about creating a supportive workplace climate by developing what they called “support pods” of workers. The idea was that these pods would sweep in and assist with an employee or sub-unit who were struggling with a large workload. The support pod systems also turned out to be an ideal method to get new employees to learn what different parts of the company did, as well as what each sub-unit was tasked with achieving. When workers first arrived, they were sent to the support pods, and only after that did they settle into a sub-unit. It’s human nature to turn to leaders in times of trouble – we need them for orientation and guidance. That’s why it’s especially important for people in positions of authority to be compassionate. If they are, others are sure to follow. Put simply, the greatest leaders lead with compassion. They believe that getting to know their employees and developing deep personal connections with them is a crucial part of their job. They listen to them closely, and truly value their workers' personal development. If you aspire to become a compassionate leader, you’re not going to get anywhere by doling out instructions from your position of power; you have to work on developing those meaningful relationships. It’s also much more personally rewarding to work that way. Let’s look at Pat Christen, CEO of HopeLab. Her organization develops technology designed to support emotional well-being. Normally, Christen, as part of her working day, would spend her time finding out what was going on in her employees’ lives, and what she could do to best support them. As part of her effort to support employees’ personal development, she set aside a certain amount of money for each of them. This fund was there so that her workers could learn anything new that they felt would benefit them personally. That’s quite different from how companies normally operate. Generally speaking, funds like that are strictly reserved for educating employees in skills that will eventually benefit the company, with little interest in employees’ individual pursuits and interests. But there’s another side to the coin. Great leaders aren’t just compassionate on their own terms – they also inspire others to behave similarly. Sometimes this needs nothing more than simply and directly communicating the importance of compassion within the workplace. LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner actually wrote an essay on the topic entitled “Leading Compassionately”. He explained that compassionate leadership was one of his biggest aims in heading up the company. However, he also freely admitted just how hard a task it was. Weiner’s right. As we have seen in these blinks, compassion is not as easy to achieve as one might first suspect. It can’t just be willed; you have to notice when someone is suffering. You have to be able to interpret emotions correctly and feel empathy for the person who is suffering. And then, to top it all off, you have to take appropriate and compassionate action to help the person in need. It is by example, and by the explicit communication of these key principles through your leadership, that you and your company will become productive, compassionate and successful. The key message in these blinks: Compassion as a principle of company management increases company performances and fosters innovation. It also creates more rewarding and enjoyable workplaces, the benefits of which can be noticed by employees and company leaders alike. After all, compassionate workplaces have lower employee turnover rates. Compassion does, however, require a certain amount of attention and investment, as well as an awareness of typical patterns that people fall into while at work. Actionable advice: Reflect on compassion in the workplace.  Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, it is hard to be compassionate. If you regularly take time – even just an hour each week – to think about what could be done to make your workplace more compassionate, you’ll achieve better results. If you’re a manager, think of the last leader you encountered whose compassion inspired you. Did you do anything to emulate him or her? Or, if you are an employee, ask yourself if you can remember any interactions where you failed to act with compassion.

Social networking has made it easier for us to connect with people around the globe, but it’s also linked to depression and social isolation. Email and instant messaging have accelerated our ability to communicate, but at the expense of the richer experience that comes with face-to-face contact. Remote working may offer flexibility but it makes it harder to collaborate with colleagues and form workplace friendships. The world is becoming a little less human, and that has a cost. So it’s time for leaders in the business world to think about how they can recognize the benefits of technology while also accepting its limitations. Leaders need to consider how they can get back to a more human approach to business that acknowledges our universal need for interaction and understanding. These blinks provide solutions to some of the most common problems caused, or exacerbated, by technology in the workplace. In these blinks, you’ll learn why technology is as much a distraction as a productivity aid; how important it is to have good friends at work; and why a heartfelt compliment is a better reward than a cash bonus. Digital technology continues to change the world. Things that barely existed a decade ago, like smartphones and tablets, messaging systems and social networks, are a fact of life today. And this technology undoubtedly has had many positive effects. It has never been easier for us to connect and stay in touch with people all over the world. But technology is also having a negative impact on people’s lives. For one, it exacerbates social isolation – a lack of contact and connectedness with other people – particularly amongst younger people who use technology the most. That’s because people crave human connection but nonetheless find it easier and simpler to turn to a device than to have a normal conversation. As a result, people feel they are getting their dose of social interaction. But in reality, they are missing out on forming real relationships. The University of Pittsburgh conducted a study in 2004, finding that a person spending two hours a day on social media doubled their risk of social isolation. Depression is also a concern. University of Houston research from 2015 found that the more active someone was on Facebook, the more likely they were to be depressed. According to the author, that may be because they compare themselves to the curated, shiny and impossible versions of their friends’ lives put on display. Isolation and depression damage social relationships that are hugely important for satisfaction. The famous Grant Study, described in great detail in three books by American psychiatrist George Vaillant, followed the lives of 268 Harvard undergraduates for 75 years from 1938 onward. The study discovered that the strongest predictor of life satisfaction among participants wasn’t their career achievements or earnings, but rather the strength of their relationships. Strong relationships have also been shown to help specifically with satisfaction and success at work. A Wharton Business School study from 2017 that interviewed over 700 employees and managers found that employee loneliness was correlated with poor performance. It’s perhaps not surprising. After all, doing business is all about relationships and relationship building. If our increasing tendency to hide behind screens and devices instead of investing in our relationships is weakening our ability to achieve work and life satisfaction, what’s the solution? Surely, it’s to get back to being more human. Read on and find out how you can help cultivate true, human fulfillment in the workplace. Money can’t buy you happiness. It may be a cliché, but it contains a lot of truth because there is much more to fulfillment and happiness than how much you earn. At the heart of employee fulfillment are human relationships. In 1943, the psychologist Abraham Maslow established his famous hierarchy of needs, which set out what is most psychologically important to humans. The oft-cited theory states that after we fulfill our most basic needs – for food, water, shelter and security – what is most important to humans is a sense of belonging and love. This theory is relevant for the workplace and backed up by evidence. Consider a Gallup poll conducted in 2006, which found that people who say they have a best friend at work are seven times more likely to say they are engaged in their work. They also self-report as being more productive and more innovative than those without a best friend in the workplace. This makes a lot of sense. As Leor Radbil, a senior associate at Bain Capital told the author, having great relationships with his coworkers not only makes work easier, it makes coming to work more enjoyable. Stronger relationships with and between your team members mean happier, more effective employees who stay with you for longer. And it very likely means you’ll feel good about yourself, not just as a boss, but as a human being for fostering them! So how can you help your employees to build fulfilling relationships? Firstly, try to build a culture in which technology doesn’t get in the way of fulfillment. Lead by example, by letting go of instant messaging and email in favor of face-to-face conversations, with all the richness – of body language, emotion, and clarity – that comes with them. Secondly, invest in getting to know people on a personal level. Do you truly understand your colleagues? Do you know their life goals and their deepest fears? If not, you can’t truly help them to achieve fulfillment. So take the time to talk, but most importantly to listen, to your employees about their likes and dislikes and their need to feel fulfilled at work. Technology has, without a doubt, helped make everything quicker. Where once we drafted, signed and sent letters that would take days to arrive, now we write emails in no time. But has technology really made us more productive? That’s hard to really say. That’s partly because while technology is fast, it can also be hugely distracting. Twenty years ago, the typical office worker was perhaps distracted by the morning post, unexpected office visitors, phone calls from clients and conversations with colleagues. Today, she is distracted by an unrelenting stream of messages and alerts. Multiple studies show that office workers receive, on average, over one hundred emails per day, each of which has to be processed mentally, even if we don’t reply to all of them. That’s problematic because it means we struggle to sustain our focus on any one task. Professor Gloria Mark at the University of California, Irvine has been tracking the impact of notifications on office workers since 2004, literally following employees while armed with a stopwatch, and timing their activities. Back in 2004, she found that the typical worker switched her attention every three minutes. By 2012, this attention switch happened pretty much once a minute. By 2014, the typical worker was switching focus even more quickly, concentrating on a single task for less than a minute at a time. The pace of life that comes with technology means that losing focus is easy, which can interfere with how you accomplish important tasks. So what can we do to fight back against this tyranny of distracting notifications? For one, you could try turning off all of your notifications, at least temporarily. If there’s a client crisis in the office or an emergency at home, someone will call you. But without the constant buzz of messages and emails, you’ll find it easier to focus on key tasks and thoughts, checking in to email and messages only when it’s convenient for you. Secondly, focus on prioritization, not multitasking. It’s much easier to be distracted by incoming emails if you don’t have a clear sense of your priorities for the day. So take a few moments at the beginning of the week and the start of every day to write down your priorities. Having your most important tasks committed to paper should help you to keep focus. Productivity is hugely important for any business, but it’s not everything. Equally important is staying fresh and creative, something that can only come from having diverse outlooks. Let’s find out why. Almost every major business today pays lip service to diversity and its importance in the workplace. But the harsh reality is that too many businesses remain homogenous. In Silicon Valley, Hispanics and African Americans combined comprise just 5 percent of the total workforce, according to a 2014 USA Today article. And despite the recent rise in prominence of the Me Too movement, and the growing debate about women’s rights in the workplace, just 24 percent of all senior business roles worldwide are filled by women. Quite apart from the inherent injustice of this situation, homogeneity leads to a deficit of diverse viewpoints and ideas. If all of your employees are all white, male and from a wealthy background, your ability to consider how to serve your customers, who are likely to be a lot more diverse, will be limited. Take Facebook. The social network’s Head of Performance Management, Vivek Raval, told the author that because their customers aren’t uniform, they simply can’t be uniform when it comes to the ideas they have and how they execute them. So how can you effectively embrace and manage diversity? Firstly, when hiring, try hard to avoid the unconscious bias that often leads us to recruit people who look, sound and think just like us. Instead of dwelling on a candidates’ school, or where they come from, focus on their ideas. Try a brainstorming exercise in interviews, asking candidates to generate ideas for a challenge you are currently grappling with. That will give you an opportunity to see if they bring fresh insights that you and your colleagues may have missed. Secondly, to ensure you cultivate a diversity of ideas from your team, strive to build a safe space in which everyone feels able to put forward their views. A great first step is to conduct an anonymous brainstorm. Next time you need to generate ideas, have everyone write down their thoughts anonymously. Then host a meeting to discuss everyone’s thoughts. This isn’t just a great way to elicit lots of ideas. You’ll notice that some people take credit for their ideas, while others stay quiet. That will help you understand who needs some attention, if they are to feel safer and more comfortable putting their ideas forward in the future. A more supportive environment means more fresh perspectives. And what business couldn’t benefit from that? Walk into any coffee shop in any big city in the world on a weekday and you’ll likely encounter at least a handful of remote workers, hunched over glowing MacBooks and tablets, typing away. It has never been easier to work remotely, and many of us love the flexibility that it offers. But, as we’ve already seen, human connection, communication and collaboration is key to personal and business success. If your people only communicate through technology, they are unlikely to form the personal bonds that create strong workplace friendships. And they are unlikely to experience many watercooler moments where moments of insight are generated by conversations that can only happen when you are together in the same space. Perhaps the best evidence for the benefits of people working together is that the very companies that have made it possible for us to work remotely are themselves encouraging working together. Apple’s ultra-modern, purpose-built headquarters in California was designed, according to the Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive, to be a building in which 12,000 employees could walk, talk, connect and collaborate. And physical proximity really is key. In a 1977 study, MIT Professor Thomas J. Allen found that the closer engineers sat to each other, the more likely they were to communicate. If two engineers sat more than 30 meters away from one another they had an almost zero chance of having regular communication. But encouraging collaboration isn’t just about having everyone in the same place. It’s also about creating a culture that values open communication. Here’s a great exercise that can help you do this: Gather your team, and ask everyone to write down one thing that they regard as a success from the last week and one thing that was a struggle. Then go around the room asking each colleague to say a little about what they’ve written down, before offering your congratulations for successes and discussing as a team how each struggle could be better overcome. By doing and repeating this exercise regularly, you’ll build a culture in which your colleagues can discuss both success and failure openly. You’ll make everyone feel more comfortable about collaborating and seeking ideas from one another. If you are like most people, it’s probably not long since you clicked like on something, whether that’s your aunt’s latest Instagram picture or a particularly witty tweet from a friend. Thanks to technology and social networks, giving and receiving recognition and validation is a fact of everyday life. So leaders should pay close attention to how they recognize great work because it will have a significant impact on employee satisfaction and business success. Indeed, a 2011 paper by Maritz, a specialist employee-reward firm, stated that employees who are consistently and meaningfully recognized at work are eleven times more likely to spend their career with a single company. Often businesses take the easy route, relying primarily on pay raises and bonuses to recognize success. But the evidence suggests, this could be counter-productive. A professor from Duke University, Dan Ariely, ran an experiment at an Intel semiconductor factory in 2016, giving different messages to different employees at the start of the week. One group was promised a voucher for free pizza if they hit their targets in a day. Another group was offered a cash bonus, and a third was promised nothing more than a rare compliment from their boss. The results? By the end of the week, the productivity of the group promised a cash bonus declined and the group due to receive the cherished managerial compliment had delivered the best results. It seems we value personal, human recognition much more than a small monetary boost. So how can you improve the way you recognize success and deliver a boost in performance as a result? Try and embrace more personal ways of showing gratitude. Instead of messaging or emailing an employee to thank them, surprise them and colleagues by acknowledging them in front of the whole team. Doing so will not just help that employee feel great, but will show everyone that hard work and achievements are recognized, and encourage everyone to strive for success. To recognize smaller achievements, try writing a note and leaving it on an employee’s desk, instead of writing an impersonal email. Or, instead of a small cash bonus, give a gift voucher for a favorite local restaurant. In an increasingly impersonal world, this personal touch will work wonders. Sometimes, it feels as if our modern work culture regards empathy – the ability and willingness to understand and share other people’s feelings – as a sign of weakness. Too many leaders are self-serving and focused on getting ahead themselves, while boosting business success at the expense of employee well-being. Indeed, according to a 2016 report into empathy in the workplace, published by employee benefits consultancy Businessolver, one third of all employees believe that the only thing their employers care about is profit. Empathy matters because when leaders demonstrate compassion and willingness to not just understand, but to actively help their teammates, through good times and bad, employees will work harder. Research from the Center for Creative Leadership in 2007 has corroborated this, showing that demonstrations of empathy from leaders are positively correlated with job performance. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, is a great example of an empathetic leader. When Tesla experienced problems with worker safety, Musk wrote to his employees. He didn’t just say that safety was his top priority. He offered to meet with every person who had had an injury and promised to get onto the production line himself and perform the same tasks his employees performed every day. You can also demonstrate your empathy as a leader by investing in face-to-face discussions with your employees that explore not just what they are doing at work, but what they are feeling. Since Sam Worobec, Director of Training for Chipotle Mexican Grill, switched from asking his employees questions like “How’s your work project going?” to questions like “How do you feel about your workload?” or “I know you have a lot of family commitments right now, are you handling that okay?,” his team members work much more effectively with him and with one another. They are more ready to talk openly about what is happening in their lives, and he can empathize, commiserate, support and congratulate them more effectively than before. And here’s one final tip for how to make conversations really meaningful. When you talk face-to-face, put your phone away. Research from Virginia Tech has shown that simply leaving a phone on the table while talking reduces the feeling of interconnectedness and empathy between people. Even when we aren’t using it, it seems, technology can get in the way of real, human connections. The key message in these blinks: Too many leaders are reliant on technology, hiding behind it instead of having real conversations with people and ignoring the extent to which it prevents meaningful collaboration. In a world dominated by technology, leaders now have to work hard to help build the human connections and relationships that all of us, deep down, crave. Those who succeed in doing so will reap the rewards of more satisfied, loyal, productive and creative employees.  Actionable advice: Ask your team for feedback about their workspace, and act upon it.  Improve your team’s experience at work by allowing them to help define it. Ask your employees for feedback about their workspaces, from the arrangement of desks and the number of potted plants to the snacks available in the kitchen. Simply giving your employees a voice about the environment they spend so much time in will go a long way in helping them feel comfortable and happy at work. Got feedback?

Fast-forward just two decades to the present day, and none of those companies is in the top five anymore. They’ve been replaced by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. In the intervening time, the world economy has come to be dominated by giant tech companies such as these. The 150 most valuable tech companies in Silicon Valley alone are valued at an astounding $3.5 trillion. Many tech companies have grown from scrappy start-ups to corporate giants in just a few years. Amazon, Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Uber, Snapchat, PayPal, LinkedIn, eBay – the list goes on and on. What are the secrets of this phenomenal growth? One of the main ones can be summed up in a single word: blitzscaling. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the heck the word “blitzscaling” means; why fortune favors the bold in the modern economy; and how one of the keys to making money is often losing money. “Blitzscaling” is a recently invented word, so if you’re not sure what it means, you’re in good company! The easiest way to define “blitzscaling” is to break it down into its components: “blitz” and “scaling.” In German, “blitz” means lightning. In modern English, it’s become an informal way to describe what happens when an organization tries to achieve something at lightning speed. For example, if a company suddenly floods the airwaves with a full-throttle advertising campaign, it would be a “marketing blitz.” “Scaling,” in turn, is shorthand for “scaling up.” In business, that means two things. First, it means growing a company in a way that keeps all of its parts proportional to each other as it develops. That’s important, because to sell more products or services, a company needs to expand its infrastructure, resources and labor force, and they have to keep pace with each other for the growth to be sustainable. For instance, imagine you’re a kid with a lemonade stand, and you want to expand your empire. To sell more lemonade, you need to invest in additional booths, lemons, cups and workers. If you try to expand in just one of these areas, the expansion won’t be sustainable. After all, if you run out of cups, it won’t matter how many lemons you can squeeze! If you manage to avoid this problem and your lemonade empire spreads to every block of the city, you’ve achieved “scaling” in the second sense of the term: your company is operating on a massive scale! Put those ideas together, and you have a first approximation of what “blitzscaling” means: it’s business growth that’s not only very rapid, but also proportional, and therefore sustainable. It’s what happened when Amazon went from having 151 employees and $5.1 million in revenue in 1996 to having 7,600 employees and $1.64 billion in revenue in 1999 – a 50-fold increase in employees and a 322-fold increase in revenue, all in just three years! But there’s a caveat we need to add to our definition. Every company seeks to grow, and every successful company grows. If “blitzscaling” only meant growing rapidly and sustainably, it would be just another word for impressive business success. While blitzscaling involves rapid, sustainable growth, there’s more to it than that. We’ll find out what the missing ingredients are in the next blinks. The word “blitz” has an unfortunate but instructive history. It goes back to the German word “blitzkrieg,” which means “lightning war.” This became the name of a military strategy that the German military implemented during World War II. Inspired by British military thinkers and later adopted by the Allies, this strategy represented a radical shift in how militaries approached warfare. In the past, they would advance slowly and cautiously into enemy territory, aiming to secure their supply lines and paths of retreat before moving forward. With blitzkrieg, in contrast, an army would advance swiftly and decisively, hoping to take the enemy by storm. This strategy involves significant risks; the attacking army might run out of supplies or be cut off from retreat. But the potential reward of overwhelming the enemy often outweighs these risks. Blitzscaling also involves throwing caution to the wind. Indeed, embracing uncertainty and risk is the word’s third defining component. Like an army of the past, a traditional company would seek to secure its position on the business battlefield (a market) before advancing to expand its territory (its market share). For instance, if an American company wanted to expand overseas, it would typically set up an office in one country, wait for it to establish itself, set up another office in a second country, wait again and so on. A blitzscaling company, in contrast, charges full-steam ahead. For example, between 2011 and 2012, Airbnb’s number of international offices rapidly grew from zero to nine. This is very risky, and it would have been much safer for Airbnb to take the traditional approach. After all, if you’ve already slowly but steadily established eight international offices one-by-one, you can feel pretty confident about the ninth. But for Airbnb, the traditional approach wasn’t an option. They had a German competitor named Wimdu hot on their heels, copying their business model. If they’d waited to have all of their ducks in a row before expanding, they’d probably have been too late; Wimdu would have conquered the international market before Airbnb’s arrival. So they took a gamble – and it paid off. They nipped the Wimdu threat in the bud, which led to a ten-fold increase in Airbnb’s bookings. Traditional businesses prioritize the efficient use of capital; they seek to get the most bang out of each buck at their disposal. A coffee shop, for example, is spending wisely when it buys its paper cups in bulk – a big box of cups only costs a few dollars but it enables hundreds of future sales. But blitzscaling companies do things differently, prioritizing speed over efficiency. That’s why local taxi companies shudder when a peer-to-peer ridesharing company like Uber rolls into town. Traditionally, a company trying to grab some of its competitors’ market share might try to undercut them by lowering its own prices. This could be balanced out by lowering production costs – but that’s a long, difficult process that might only allow for a very small price drop anyway. So what does a blitzscaling company like Uber do? It drops prices so low that they don’t even cover costs – a strategy that, for traditional businesses, would amount to corporate suicide. But Uber can afford to do this because it has a huge advantage – a war chest of billions of dollars in investment capital, and no compunction about using it to its advantage. This allows Uber to lose money for the sake of conquering a new market as quickly as possible. It’s a risky strategy, but one that can offer a big payoff in the form of first-scaler advantage. First-scaler advantage goes to the company that is first to scale up and dominate its business ecosystem. Once a company has done that, it becomes incredibly hard to compete against, making competition in today’s economy, especially in the tech industry, increasingly a winner-take-all sprint to the finish line. Think back to the early years of online social networking, when Facebook, MySpace and Friendster were all competing for dominance. Now, when’s the last time you used MySpace or Friendster? That’s because Facebook successfully scaled up. Uber’s strategy is to aggressively expand, city by city, and its prioritization of speed over efficiency allows it to dominate new markets quickly and gain first-scaler advantage. Another advantage that blitzscaling companies enjoy is the ability to leverage the increasingly networked nature of our world. We'll explore that in the next blink. Growth factors are things that can boost the growth of a company, and there are four that every blitzscaling company should seek to maximize: network effects, market size, distribution and high gross margins. The first, network effects, can be a huge boost to any company scrambling to gain first-scaler advantage. Essentially, “network effects” occur when a network’s value increases for users as more people begin using it. Consider Airbnb. The more that people offer their properties on the company’s website, the more it becomes the go-to marketplace for guests seeking homestays. And the more that guests flock to the marketplace, the more people want to offer their properties on it. Network effects create a positive feedback loop. Because of this feedback loop, a start-up company wanting to compete with Airbnb will have their work cut out for them. Since its rapid, network-effect-powered growth allowed Airbnb to seize the homestay market’s first-scaler advantage, Airbnb has a virtually insurmountable head start on all would-be competitors. Where there’s a network – and networks are all around us these days – there’s the potential for a network effect, a fact that many tech companies have used to gain success. Uber, Airbnb and eBay connect buyers and sellers of goods and services to massive marketplace networks. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter connect people into multimillion- or even multibillion-user (in the case of Facebook) social networks. YouTube connects video creators and consumers into the world’s most popular entertainment network. And then there’s the granddaddy network of them all: the internet itself, along with the network of more than two billion smartphone users who can access that network anytime, anywhere. Of course, that network is also a resource that tech companies are eager to tap into. For them, it represents the ultimate marketplace, open 24/7 and located everywhere at once without the need for expensive brick-and-mortar shops. Of course, potential customers don’t necessarily equate to sales. For that, you need people who are willing and able to buy – in other words, a market. That’s the idea behind market size as a growth factor. For a company to blitzscale, its market needs to be sizable. Otherwise, there just won’t be enough money to fuel or motivate its funding and growth. Gross margins are a pretty simple concept. They’re a measure of how much money your business takes in after costs are covered. Let’s say that your product costs you $0.50 to produce and sell. That’s your cost of goods sold, or COGS. Then you sell the product for $0.75 per unit – that’s your revenue. Well, $0.75 revenue minus a $0.50 COGS equals $0.25 – that’s your gross margin, the money you have in the bank after each sale. It’s distinct from profit, since you might use it to cover other expenses like taxes. It’s important though because it’s a ready source of funding for any new initiative you might want to pursue, from expanding your operations to developing a new product line. And when you want to rapidly grow your company to a massive scale, high gross margins become crucial. Gross margin is usually represented as a percentage, calculated by dividing it by revenue. Dividing our $0.25 gross margin by $0.75 in revenue, then, gives a gross margin of 33 percent. That’s higher than General Electric’s margin of 27 percent. But most tech-industry giants have gross margins that start at 60 percent and can be as high as 90 percent. Google’s is 61 percent, and Facebook’s is 87 percent. High gross margins give you more than money. They also make it easier for you to fund expansion, because the higher they are, the more investors will notice you. Imagine that company A has a gross margin of 66 percent, while Company B’s is 33 percent. That means that B brings in half as much money per sale as A, and has to generate twice as many sales just to end up with the same amount of cash. That’s going to require more resources, more infrastructure and more workers than its competitor – not just for manufacturing, but for things like handling customer service phone lines for twice as many customers. To investors, it’s clear that A has a much better chance of growing than B and, because of this, they’ll choose to invest in the former. This leads to another positive feedback loop: with more investment capital to spend on expanding its operations, A will grow even more easily than B. When investors see that growth, even more of their money will flow A’s way, leading to yet more growth. Thus, high gross margins allow companies to accumulate the massive war chests of capital required to pursue growth on the equally massive scale of blitzscaling – and, as we’ll see, tech companies have a natural advantage when it comes to achieving high gross margins, and therefore attracting capital. You might have a brilliant product and a well-defined market clamoring for it, but getting it into the hands of customers isn’t just a technicality. Distribution is also a growth factor, and distributing a product or service on a massive scale can happen in two ways. The first is using a distribution network that already exists, like the US Postal Service (USPS). Netflix tapped into this when it launched its original rent-a-DVD-by-mail service. Amazon takes advantage of it, too, striking a deal with USPS that allows it to ship small packages for only about $1 each. The other method is viral distribution. First, you infect one customer, then she infects more customers. Each of them infects even more customers, and so forth and so on. There are two kinds of viral distribution, organic and incentivized, and the early days of PayPal provide an example of both. Back then, every time a buyer wanted to send a payment via PayPal, the seller had to set up a PayPal account to receive it. This organic viral distribution naturally led to more users of the service. PayPal’s incentivized distribution, meanwhile, actively provided users with an incentive to spread its service: get a friend to sign up for it, and both you and your friend receive $10 each. Combining these two varieties of viral distribution, PayPal was able to grow at an astonishing rate of between 7 and 10 percent per day. Imagine, then, the kind of growth that’s possible when there isn’t a need for physical distribution, nor for the infrastructure, resources and workers that distribution centers entail. To do without such things, you’ve got to go digital. Consider a software company whose demand doubles overnight. To meet that demand and double sales, the company will need…nothing. It costs essentially zero to duplicate a piece of software that merely needs to be copied from one set of circuits to another. But digital companies aren’t only extremely scalable; they also enjoy high gross margins. Because they can easily plug into the internet and its online marketplace networks, digital companies can reap all the rewards of network effects and gain access to large markets for their products. These perks, combined with ease of product duplication, are a perfect recipe for excellent gross margins. That’s why so many successful examples of blitzscaling come from the tech industry; having a digital product and service allows companies to take advantage of all four of blitzscaling’s growth factors. It also helps minimize the two big growth limiters – both of which we’ll explore in the remaining blinks. To generate the level of sales and revenue that blitzscaling requires, you need to identify a good market and offer a product that satisfies that market – in other words, you’ve got to achieve product/market fit. This fit is the first of two growth limiters that blitzscaling companies need to watch out for. The greater the product/market fit, the greater the chance of rapid growth. But immediately achieving perfect product/market fit isn’t easy. To improve the fit, most companies have to adjust their product to make it better suit the market’s demands. It’s easier for a tech company to be nimble with regard to product/market fit, of course; tinkering by bringing out a new version of software or testing out a new app feature requires less infrastructure than redoing a physical commodity. You just have to edit some code, not buy new machinery. Tech companies can also pivot much more easily than companies with a physical product, switching from trying to achieve one product/market fit to another. Consider PayPal. In its first year of operation (originally under the name of Confinity), it went through four pivots – shifting its service from cell-phone encryption to cell-phone payments, then to PalmPilot payments, then to email payments and finally to eBay transactions. Now imagine that you’ve achieved an ideal product/market fit and generated high demand, but you haven’t got the mass-production capabilities to fulfill that demand. You’re losing out on potential sales, which means you’ll need to scale up your operations to get to the necessary level of mass production. Navigating the challenges of the second growth limiter of blitzscaling, operational scalability, can make or break a company. This limiter isn’t as daunting for tech companies, which rely less on physical infrastructure. But even a digital-only company has some physical infrastructure to expand in order to scale up – and failure to do this can be devastating. For example, remember Friendster? It was a serious contender for the social network crown, the first of its kind to break through into the mainstream. Friendster went viral in 2003, gaining millions of users in just a few months. But the company’s computer servers couldn’t keep up with the demand, with users waiting up to 40 seconds for the website to load. Within two years, a speedier competitor called MySpace had left Friendster in the dust. The challenges of scaling up are complex – and they become increasingly complex as a company grows. Consider just one of the challenges: company organization. If you start a company with three friends, organization can be pretty informal and based on one-to-one relationships. After all, there are only six pairs of unique relationships between the four of you. But if you add just two people, the number of relationships shoots up to 15. Add another 20, and you’re up to 325. When you have 25,000 employees, as Facebook does, you’re at more than 312 million relationships. More formal organization quickly becomes necessary, meaning that departments need to be created, and these departments need managers and submanagers. Growing complexity brings with it thorny questions of management philosophy, organizational hierarchy and company culture. These questions are especially challenging for a blitzscaling company, since it has to continually answer and reanswer them in the midst of rapid, massive growth. Having a management strategy in place to handle this process is crucial. Uber found this out the hard way in late 2016 and early 2017, a period of management problems and turmoil from which the company is still recovering. Sexual harassment allegations emerged. The Verge reported a scheme that involved Uber creating fake accounts with its rival Lyft. Eight vice presidents and department heads left the company in just half a year. A management strategy won’t mean much without a business plan that secures long-term growth, however. Initially, a blitzscaling company with the right investment backing can afford to lose money for the sake of rapid expansion and market dominance – but only for a while. Once it achieves dominance, those losses need to turn into profits. Otherwise, you’ll have displeased investors who may cut off the flow of investment capital that’s been powering your growth. But for a company with a digital product or service, transforming losses into gains can be a challenge. That’s because people generally aren’t willing to shell out much money for such products and services. If Facebook charged you a quarter every time you logged in, would you check your timeline multiple times per day? Even if your company has maximized all the growth factors it takes to blitzscale, it won’t generate huge profits long-term without the right business plan. Look at Craigslist or IMDb (the International Movie Database). They fit the profile of blitzscaling companies, optimizing network effects and product/market fit, and they’re valuable in their own, nonmonetary ways. But they don’t earn much. So how can tech companies make money? We’ll look at some ways in the next blink. For a company that wants to be successful at blitzscaling, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for developing a business plan that can convert massive growth into equally massive profits. However, there are seven general patterns that successful companies have followed. Three of these relate directly to the advantages of doing business digitally. The first pattern involves the advantages of selling a product that is purely digital. For example, consider an extra, purchasable outfit, or “skin,” for a character in a video game. Since it only exists virtually, a skin costs practically nothing to make and sell. This means gross margins of nearly 100 percent. Purely digital products have become a very lucrative line of business for many tech companies, especially in the video game industry. Of course, if you’re a company with physical products, you can’t just magically turn them into digital ones – but you can still harness the power of going digital. This is the second pattern. For example, Amazon is heavily invested in physical products – to wit, the millions of things you can buy from its online store. That’s a lot of things to manage – but Amazon has turned to digital-management systems to make the most efficient use of its inventory. It’s also been increasingly turning to its software-as-a-service (SaaS) division, Amazon Web Services, which generated 150 percent of Amazon’s revenue in 2016. SaaS revenues were so high that they covered the losses of Amazon’s retail business! What is SaaS? Well, that’s the third pattern. It basically means selling software on a subscription model, rather than on a one-time-purchase or licensing model. The latter used to be the traditional model for selling enterprise software, which is software meant for organizations rather than individuals. To make that model work, the licenses for the software had to be sold for thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars, which priced out small and medium-sized businesses, and therefore limited the software’s market size. With the subscription model, however, a cloud-computing software company like Salesforce can sell its products and services at a much lower cost, greatly expanding its market size in the process. The more a company can do business digitally, then the greater the potential for outsized profits. And facilitating other companies’ digital endeavors has huge potential all its own, as we’ll see in the next blink. If you’re buying or selling a product in the current networked age, then you’re probably familiar with the go-to platform for conducting your business. For example, if you’re a music label, an ebook publisher or a movie distributor, the iTunes store has become one of your go-to selling platforms. That’s the fourth successful pattern – leveraging the power of platforms. If you can establish your product or service as the standard platform for buying and selling products, creating documents or doing any other kind of revenue-generating activity, you yourself stand to capture a large share of that revenue. Apple, for example, takes a hefty 30 percent cut of the proceeds from products sold on the iTunes store. It’s closely related to the fifth pattern, which is taking advantage of the growth potential of online marketplaces. These are a specific type of platform – platforms that not only bring buyers and sellers together, but also let them set their own prices through the market forces of supply and demand, just as Airbnb and eBay do. For profit seekers, the attraction of marketplaces is the same as normal platforms: you can take a cut of the transactions. The sixth pattern involves tapping into the eyeball-capturing power of online content-sharing feeds, like Twitter or Facebook’s timelines. Because feeds are so effective at captivating people’s attention, they’re very attractive to advertisers, who will pay premium prices to insert their ads and sponsored content into addictive streams of information and entertainment. Advertising also brings us to the seventh and final pattern, which is to offer your product or service for free and try to make money some other way. Advertising is an option here, too. Another is offering a premium service and hoping users upgrade to it from the free one. For example, DropBox offers people 2 gigabytes of cloud-based storage for free. If you like the service and want more storage, you have to pay for it. These seven patterns aren’t recipes, but each has been used as a guideline by many massively profitable businesses. As with all the hallmarks of blitzscaling, they’re new (or relatively new) and they’re bold, and they have the potential to lead to outrageous success. Let them inspire you, and watch your company grow at lightning speed. The key message in these blinks: Blitzscaling requires an outsized ambition and a tolerance for taking big risks in the hope of a big payoff. Increasingly, though, there are some patterns to guide this kind of ambitious thinking. Embracing uncertainty and risk while prioritizing speed over efficiency, taking advantage of four growth factors and navigating growth limiters can all set a company up for rapid and massive expansion that will be sustainable in the future. But the hands at the helm also have to be realistic about what they’re steering their company into, with management strategy and a business plan that anticipate the changes and challenges of rapid growth. With a clear vision, blitzscaling can help a business dominate an ecosystem for a long time to come. Actionable advice: Look at blitzscaling success stories outside of the tech industry.  In these blinks, we focused on companies in the tech industry because they provide the clearest illustrations of how blitzscaling works. However, blitzscaling can happen outside of the tech industry and even beyond the business world altogether. The clothing company Zara, the nonprofit educational organization Khan Academy and the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama are all examples of companies and organizations that implemented elements of blitzscaling outside of the tech industry.

People often think it’s the pay, yet even the most lavishly compensated positions can be dull as dishwater. The real killer is disengagement. Few things rival the dreariness that comes from a routine built around mindlessly clocking in, running down the minutes and waiting for the next paycheck to clear. But that’s not just a problem for boredom-afflicted employees – it’s also bad for business. If you want your company to thrive in today’s fast-paced, technology-driven world, you need your workers to be switched on, enthusiastic and committed. But, as Glenn Elliott and Debra Corey argue in Build It, there’s a problem. Too many companies pay lip service to the idea of an engaged and productive workforce without actually taking steps to achieve it. They continue to lie to their employees, treat them as adversaries and give them crappy jobs without autonomy or excitement. That has to change. In this manifesto for a new world of work, they provide the blueprints for the Engagement Bridge™ – a radical new way of thinking about management, HR, employee satisfaction and getting the most out of your business. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why money matters but not in the ways people think; what a difference a thoughtfully designed workplace can make; and why businesses need to move beyond the old factory model. Have you ever had a job where the only thing you cared about was your paycheck? Or maybe you’ve been lucky and had a job you just couldn’t wait to start each morning? That’s the difference between a disengaged and an engaged employee. So what defines engagement? Well, the first thing to note is that it’s not the same thing as happiness. All sorts of things might make an employee happy. Great pay, a nice office and next to no responsibility add up to a pretty comfortable gig, but they don’t mean that someone will be engaged with their work. A truly engaged employee fits three criteria. First off, they understand and believe in the direction in which an organization is moving. Secondly, they can see how their role contributes to achieving that goal. Lastly, they’re genuinely invested in their employer’s success. You can see why engagement is so important! It makes businesses stronger and more innovative. That’s because engaged employees make better decisions. After all, they know what their company’s aims are and want to contribute to realizing them. Take the British retailer Marks & Spencer. An internal study found that the stores with the highest employee engagement rates were twice as likely to receive the highest service rating. Staff absences, by contrast, were a whopping 25 percent lower. Engagement is also becoming more vital as the world changes. The pace of technological change today is breathtaking. In the early twentieth century, it took radio 38 years to reach 50 million users. Facebook achieved that in a single year; Angry Birds needed just 35 days! If companies want to keep up, they need engaged, adaptable workers striving for success. There are plenty of examples of businesses that didn’t achieve this – just think of the once mighty Blockbuster empire. It failed to adapt to the rise of online streaming. Today, it’s a mere ghost of its former self. That leads to the million-dollar question: How do you cultivate a sense of engagement among employees? In the following blinks, we’ll explore the authors’ brand-new trademarked model designed to do just that – the Engagement Bridge™. Over a decade of research involving 2,000 companies provides the basis of Elliott and Corey’s Engagement Bridge™ concept. It’s tailor-made to help you create a more engaged and productive workforce. The bridge has ten distinct components – seven “beams” and three supporting “rocks.” You don’t need every part to build a functional bridge, but the strongest constructions incorporate all ten elements. Let’s start with the beams. These can be broken down into four separate subcategories. The first is open and honest communication. That means building trust between employees and the company for which they work. The second is a clearly defined purpose, mission and values. This is the reason your company – and therefore your employees – do what they do. The third element is made up of two related elements – leadership and management. So what’s the difference? Well, think of it this way: leadership is what you say, management is what you do. Finally, there’s job design, learning and recognition. The best-designed jobs have learning and recognition built into them. Next, come the boulders which support the bridge. These won’t create a sense of engagement on their own, but engagement built without them won’t be sustainable. The first element is pay and benefits. Money matters, but not in the way you might think. Next is workspace. That doesn’t just mean how an office looks but how it affects the way employees move through it and work in it. The final supporting element is wellbeing. If you want your employees to fulfill their potential, you need to pay attention to their personal health. That includes both physical and mental health as well as their work-life balance and financial solvency. In the following blinks, we’ll take a closer look at these components and explore how you can start building your Engagement Bridge™! All the companies the authors looked at in their research made significant progress in one area – openness and honesty. Putting this first beam in place is vital to creating a productive working atmosphere. That’s because being honest with people is the best way to gain their trust. A good place to start is by understanding just how widespread lying and mistrust are in many business practices. Take “interview skills.” As a would-be employee, you present a version of yourself that’s been carefully curated for the sole purpose of securing a job. Or think about legal departments filling policies and contracts with clauses and subclauses that seem purposefully designed to trip employees up because they’re scared of being sued. All of these things end up creating distrust between companies and their staff. That’s especially noticeable the further down the hierarchy you go. A survey conducted by the Edelman Trust Barometer in 2016 found that while 64 percent of executives trust their companies, only 51 percent of managers and 48 percent of average employees do. So what’s the solution? Well, by being more open and honest, you can start building trust. Consider the social media company Buffer. It publishes the salaries of its employees as well as the reasoning behind its pay grades. It also releases its pricing models and revenue data. As a result, everyone knows exactly where they stand. And that makes the company an attractive option. Once Buffer had embraced their new transparency strategy, applications to join the company rose by 50 percent! Another important factor is the frequency of communication. Keeping the channels open at all times lets employees stay in the loop and means they feel included and valued. This is a strategy that’s been adopted to good effect by internet video-hosting company Wistia. Once it had too many employees to hold a weekly stand-up meeting, it switched to a different model. Now Wistia holds a weekly all-hands meeting known as the “show and tell.” Anyone can give a short presentation on their ideas, projects or other news. That’s a great way to boost awareness of what’s going on in the company. But communication needs to be heartfelt. How you talk to people matters as much as what you’re saying. Whether it’s a policy announcement or a review, it’s important to be honest and open about the reasoning behind decisions. Say you had to write an obituary for your company. How would you like it to be remembered? What mattered most to it, and what was your company trying to achieve? The answers to these questions make up the second beam – your purpose, mission and values. Defining these clearly boosts employee productivity. So where do you start? Think of it this way. Your mission is the what, your purpose the why and your values the how. Put differently, what is your main goal? Why do you want to achieve that? And how will you go about doing it? Take the author’s company, Reward Gateway. It wants to make workplaces better places to work because it believes people deserve meaningful jobs and that business performs better when people are engaged. To do that, it pushes the boundaries and delights its customers to create and deliver technology to achieve just that. These are two of the eight Reward Gateway values. Having a clear sense of purpose also works wonders for long-term health. Adam Grant, a professor at Wharton Business School, determined that teachers who identified with their jobs were much more likely to avoid stress and burnout. Telemarketers, meanwhile, were four times as successful when they identified a set mission for themselves. But it’s not enough to just define your purpose, mission and values – you also have to communicate them. Australian telecoms company Vocus Communications shows how this can be done. They’re up-front about what they believe and get the message across with their memorable, tongue-in-cheek values. These include “clever company, no muppets,” “have a crack,” “don’t screw the customer” and “don’t be a d***head.” That translates into a breezy, customer-oriented ethos that filters into everyday working practices and shapes the way employees think about their company. A good place to start when it comes to defining your values is your employees. Ask them what the company stands for. Getting input from the people who work there every day will give you a sense of what’s important to them. That’s a sound basis for cultivating a strong organizational culture. As we saw in an earlier blink, leadership is what you say while management is what you do. They’re both extremely important elements of the model, but they have to be correctly aligned if you want to build a strong bridge. So how do you slot them into place? Well, you need to make sure that management is in tune with the values of the company. That’s essential to keeping employees on board. After all, managers have the biggest effect on the life of a company. They’re the ones doing the hiring and firing as well as leading the day-to-day and the promotional and development work. Despite that, many managers fail to live the values that the company have so carefully developed. That means they often fail to cultivate the kinds of environments in which people do their best work. Take an example from one of the authors’ experiences. Elliott recalls finding clauses in his contract which flatly contradicted the company’s declared values. For all the talk of trusting staff and being human, the contract prohibited employees from leaving to work for competitors and withheld benefits during the probationary period. That sort of misalignment of stated values and actual policy confuses and upsets employees. Rightly so – they’ve been offered one thing and given something entirely different! Engaging management requires a different tack. It designs HR policy with the interests of employees in mind and in such a way that it reflects the company’s mission, purpose and values. The clothing retailer Gap Inc. shows how this can be done. Its performance review system has been crafted with its staff in mind. It’s called GPS or “Grow. Perform. Succeed.” Just like a car’s navigation system, it helps employees stay on track and reach their desired destination. So how does it work? Instead of wasting a ton of money and time on an outdated, rigid system of ratings and checklists, it puts the individual center stage. It looks at employees’ personal goals and focuses on delivering more honest and broader performance reviews. And it works. Performance has improved across the company, and it’s such a success story that Harvard Business School uses it as a case study for its MBA program. But you don’t need to design a whole new review system. A simple and effective practical step every company can take is to ask its employees to review their contracts and company policies and talk about what makes them uncomfortable. Once you’ve done that, you can start revising the parts that are legally amendable and making the language clearer. Things have changed in the workplace. In the old days, a boss was a boss; his word was final. Today, employees have a much more powerful voice. Top-down policies can be rejected from the bottom. This shift in attitudes is reflected in the rise of websites like Glassdoor that allow workers to anonymously review their employers. More and more people are making use of these platforms – approximately 41 million people use Glassdoor every month! That makes the third and fourth elements – leadership and management – more important than ever before. Employees are much more likely to be adaptable and implement changes when they respect and trust their leaders. The British leisure and car accessory retailer Halfords has developed a canny strategy to help achieve this. The company developed a leadership model which drives how they run their business and how they develop their leaders. They even measure against it, creating a “leadership index” for each leader based on how employees view them as a leader. Half the battle is already won when you know what employees think about your leadership. Once you know what’s perceived as a problem, you can start taking steps to change things. Halfords’ model has helped boost sales by 13 percent over the last five years! But great leadership isn’t just about making sound judgments that take employees into account. It’s just as important to include them in the decision-making process itself. Take the British charity St John Ambulance. Its employees are involved in important decisions through a series of consultation sessions. That means that big changes are shaped by everyone who works for the organization rather than the result of orders coming from up top. Taking time to work out objectives and solutions together with the people who’ll be responsible for implementing them might sound like a no-brainer, but a huge number of companies don’t do it! That’s a problem. By skipping this vital step, they end up missing out on a chance to gain valuable insights and engage their employees. The production line model was created by the economist Adam Smith in the eighteenth century. He thought that employees shouldn’t be like artisans working on one thing from start to finish but more like individual parts in a larger machine. But this kind of specialization meant that people stopped taking pleasure in their work. Smith argued that it didn’t matter because money would continue to provide a reliable incentive. Most jobs today are still based on this outdated model. Efficiency continues to be rated more highly than taking pride in what you do. That’s a mistake because it ignores the fifth beam of the Engagement Bridge – job design. Well-designed, high engagement jobs are challenging but also give the job holder control. The challenge makes them exciting and the control gives the worker autonomy and self-determination. The problem in many organizations is that those with the power to make jobs more satisfying don’t see this as an issue. Their jobs, after all, are pretty complex and all about taking control! That means managers and HR sometimes fail to empathize with other employees. When that happens, the glaringly obvious cause of disengagement – poor job design – goes unrecognized. So what’s a well-designed job? The best place to start is with freedom and responsibility. Employees need to feel like they have the space to fail as well as grow. Consider the video game developer Valve Corporation. The company implemented a totally “flat hierarchy” which gives every employee complete freedom to innovate and follow their instincts. That’s a radical model, of course, but it works in Valve’s case. Then there’s software marketer HubSpot. They realized that reducing the size of teams can make a massive difference. Today, their product teams are made up of just three members. That’s a great way of increasing employees’ sense of autonomy and speeding up communication. The side effect? Much higher engagement rates! People and organizations thrive when employees are given the chance to learn and develop. Luckily, that’s easier today than ever before. Companies have a vast array of technologies at their disposal to help teach their workers new skills. But you can’t rely on training courses and learning technologies alone. Learning and development require employees to have enough freedom in their role to experiment, try new things out and occasionally fail. That’s why Learning is so close to Job Design on The Engagement Bridge. When those values are part of the company’s DNA, employees are much more likely to be able to learn and develop. Looking forward is also central to creating a learning culture. That means focusing on developing your staff to meet the challenges of the future. Take the Australian branch of the fast-food restaurant KFC. They recently kickstarted a program geared toward their young employees, who have an average age of 17. Known as #myplan, the program looks to these workers’ future prospects beyond KFC by helping them articulate their life goals and ambitions. Although the company isn’t specifically training staff for restaurant work, it has managed to create an ingrained learning culture. In the first year alone, around 4,000 employees took part! Fostering that sort of working environment takes thought. You need to assess your current programs and understand why you want to implement learning strategies. Once you’re clear about your goal, you can start designing your programs. When Elliott was working in a graduate job in the early 1990s, he designed a system that improved his team’s ability to handle administrative tasks. He was nominated for an innovation award and thanked in person by his boss. He felt flattered and pleased that his work had been recognized. A year later, he received a gift card and an impersonal letter of recognition from a faceless, centralised HR department. That left a sour taste. The lateness suggested indifference. It would have been much better if his superiors had simply left it at the thank you. Cases like Elliott’s show how little official “recognition” schemes often achieve. Huge amounts of money are wasted every year on reward programs that don’t do very much to engage employees. In the United States, around two percent of total pay is spent on recognition. That adds up to a whopping $46 billion every year. So what do you get for all that cash? Actually, surprisingly little. The authors’ research suggests 80 percent of senior staff feel their employees are adequately recognized each month. But ask the employees themselves and you find that a mere 17 percent feel that their organization strongly supports recognition! The problem isn’t just the amount being spent, it’s what it’s being spent on. A study by Bersin & Associates found that 87 percent of all this money goes toward tenure rewards for lengthy service. But when the authors surveyed employees, they found that 72 percent would be happy and feel appreciated with a simple thank you for their hard work. As author Corey says, she isn’t surprised with these results. She knows if her husband only said he loved her every 5, 10 and 15 years, she wouldn’t be happy either. In fact, she’d probably leave him, which is what your employees will do if all you do is recognize long service. What employees want is continuous and timely recognition that motivates them to carry on putting the hours in. Feedback is vital. In fact, it constitutes the seventh beam of engagement. A good example of a company that’s put this into practice is the DIY company Homeserve. They have a four-tiered recognition program which ranges from annual and quarterly awards to e-cards thanking employees for going the extra mile. The multiple tiers built into the program are what make it so effective. Gratitude is expressed from the highest levels as well as from colleagues on the shop floor. And it’s popular. Over 22,000 e-cards were sent, and 5,000 awards exchanged between just 3,000 staff in the first year! Not bad, right? But the takeaway point is also important. If you want to boost recognition, make your employees visible not only to their superiors but also among themselves. Peer-to-peer nomination programs like Homeserve’s provide a helpful model. In the previous blinks, we’ve explored the connecting beams of the Engagement Bridge. Now it’s time to turn to the supporting rocks. Let’s start with pay and benefits. Throwing money at disengagement doesn’t solve the problem altogether. But it is an effective strategy to prevent your employees from becoming disengaged. But it’s not just the size of the paycheck that’s important. After all, people can feel disengaged wherever they are on the pay ladder. What really matters is fairness. Consider an experiment carried out in 2003. Two capuchin monkeys were trained to do tasks to collect pebbles and then rewarded with bits of cucumber. Both were happy enough with this exchange until the researchers mixed things up and gave one monkey a much tastier grape rather than a slice of cucumber. The other monkey was furious. It threw its cucumber away and rattled its cage to show its displeasure. People aren’t all that different. We don’t like the idea of others getting more than we do for the same thing. In fact, a 2017 study of HR professionals found that income inequality was the top contributor to stress, 25 percent ahead of the second biggest contributor. The best pay and benefits schemes act on this insight. They prioritize fairness of salaries and use benefits as a cultural differentiator. Software company Basecamp has a strict policy of paying people on the same level the same amount of money. They also build bonuses into base pay, putting a quarter of their annual profits into salaries rather than one-off “extras.” That’s good for morale and retention. As we’ve seen in previous blinks, the best place to start when it comes to implementing new programs is asking your employees for feedback. What do they value and what would they like to see changed? If you want to cater to their individual needs, it’s a good idea to find out what those needs are! When it comes to where we work, there’s an important difference between place and space. The second rock anchoring the Engagement Bridge is all about the latter. In other words, it’s about more than how an office looks – it’s the way employees interact with their virtual and physical environment that’s really important. So what makes for a good working environment? Let’s start with agile working and technology. Far too many offices constrain workers. People are expected to sit still in a chair and get on with their work for the whole day. Luckily, attitudes are changing. Employers have started recognizing how movement can boost productivity. That’s known as agile working. Essentially, it means doing different tasks in different parts of the office – reading in one area, taking calls in another, writing in another and so on. That’s good for the working atmosphere. Colleagues bump into each other more frequently, increasing the chances of serendipitous collaborations. Then there’s technology. Getting the technical set-up right is vital if you want employees to be more productive. Around 72 percent of workers claim they struggle to find the information they need when they’re forced to rely on outdated systems. Keeping your tech up-to-date helps keep things moving. Implementing big changes isn’t easy, however, so expect initial resistance if you plan on bold reforms. Remember, the best workplaces are usually the result of reformers sticking to their guns and following through. Consider the multinational company General Electric. When the company’s new CEO took charge of the Sydney offices and implemented agile working, there was plenty of kickback. But over time, employees came to value their more fluid and interactive workspace. Today, the only permanent features are the employees’ lockers. Everything else moves around constantly. Financial comparison website money.co.uk took a similarly radical step. The company refurbished a listed British castle with the help of interior designer and TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. What helped was that this step was undertaken with employee input. So where do you start if you want to give your office an overhaul? It’s a good idea to start by taking stock of what you need and what you have. Are there enough quiet spaces, for example? Do you need extra meeting rooms? Or maybe you just need to make your workplace more comfortable? Once you’ve thought it through, take your plans to your employees and ask them what they think. They might just spot something you’ve missed! A 2016 study found that the average worker took just four days of sick leave annually. Pretty good, right? Well, there’s a catch. Most employees claimed that they were too stressed or tired to concentrate fully on their work for an additional 57 days per year! That makes well-being essential to productivity. This is the final part of the Engagement Bridge. Many companies already pay some attention to their employees’ well-being. Healthy food options and gym membership have become increasingly common. But there are two other aspects of wellbeing that need to be taken care of – mental and financial health. These are often ignored because of societal taboos. We just don’t like talking about mental health and money issues. That’s a mistake. Anxiety of any kind saps productivity. Taking a fully holistic attitude to health, by contrast, does wonders for business results and innovation. So how do you go about doing that? Two things are important. Firstly, you need to take a personalized approach. Secondly, that flexibility needs to be anchored in the company’s culture. Take the British building materials supplier Travis Perkins PLC. The company started running a financial wellbeing program tailored to the needs of its staff. Rather than simply throwing money at its employees, it mapped out landmark financial stages in life like buying a house or having kids. That allowed the company to design special programs and provide relevant and useful information for employees, giving them the know-how to make sound choices. Then there’s the web-hosting service provider Weebly. It introduced a special sabbatical program for staff members who’ve been there for five years or longer. It gives employees six weeks of paid leave and a round-trip airfare to anywhere in the world. It’s an effective way of letting people recharge their batteries and avoid burnout. Having looked at the basic building blocks of the Engagement Bridge, you might be wondering how to start putting all this information into action. In this final blink, we’ll draw the threads together and get you ready to start building engagement in your company. Let’s start by looking at the basic principles. You’ll have noticed that there were a number of pretty universal themes in the previous blinks. Asking your employees what they think is really helpful. Open and honest communication are the heart and soul of engagement, building trust that is needed in other areas of the bridge. You might not have realized that these are all principles we teach to young children! Telling the truth, being kind and playing fair are all values we try to pass on to our kids. One of the problems afflicting working environments is that these basic and fundamental ideas seem not to have made it out of the playground and into the office. That’s a pity. By treating employees fairly and trusting them, you’ll create a more productive working environment. On the other hand, some elements of the bridge will be more relevant to you than others. Organizations are very different. Each has its own needs. That means it’s important to define what you want your company to be before implementing changes. Once you know where you’re heading, it’ll be much easier to engage your employees and get them onboard for the journey ahead. Mission goals come in all shapes and sizes. The streaming site Netflix, for example, says “a great place to work is awesome colleagues.” Amazon defines its goal as “an intense focus on the customer through brave leadership.” Define your mission and you’ll be able to see how and when to build each element of the bridge. The key message in these blinks: Employee engagement is vital for a modern organization to thrive. It keeps the company relevant by driving productivity and innovation. By looking at each of the ten elements – open and honest communication; purpose, mission and values; leadership; management; job design; learning; recognition; pay and benefits; workspace and well-being – you too can build an organization that benefits its employees as much as they benefit the organization. Actionable advice: Assess your organization. Rather than trying to build the entire Engagement Bridge at once, look at your organization with regard to each of the elements and think about where you could make the most immediate changes – the enemy of engagement is inertia. Notice what exactly you are or aren’t lacking and what you would most like to improve, and start today! Think whether or not you could successfully apply these examples to your company and why they would or wouldn’t work. You don’t have to follow the examples exactly, but approach these crucial areas and you will reap the benefits. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Just by stating, “We want a higher profit margin,” they think that employees will jump to action and align their work with this broad and poorly conceived goal. It just doesn’t work that way! These blinks show you that to change a culture, you have to integrate that change from the very top of your organization to the very bottom. And focusing on results and goals is just one small part of the puzzle. You have to consider all the elements on the table – company experience, employee beliefs and ingrained practices – and then ensure that what you change is actually sustained. Yet in doing so, you’ll find that your organization will hum along like a well-oiled machine, and processes that were previously bogged down now run with precision and ease. In the following blinks, you’ll discover how General Motors overhauled its corporate culture and stemmed massive losses; why changing a culture is a transition and not a transformation; and why one bookstore lets employees give tokens to each other. Managers shape a company’s culture every day in the experiences they create for employees. Employees in turn learn how things are done, and an organizational culture establishes itself. Yet not all organizational cultures are healthy. In some cases, they can even do more damage than good. This is why leaders need to focus on creating a culture that is beneficial for the company as a whole, from the lowest levels all the way to the top. But how is this done? The first step is to define your goals and a strategy to reach them. For example, “Make decisions. Take risks. Move fast. Be accountable,” was the strategy General Motors put forward in 2009 to change its culture and stop the company from losing money once and for all. How did GM decide on this route? To shape your culture and help your organization win, you have to understand the results pyramid. There are three key components that make up the results pyramid: experiences, beliefs and actions. Stacked on top of each other, the components all contribute to the end result, or the achievements of your organization. In short: experiences promote beliefs, beliefs impact actions and actions generate results. Alaris Medical Systems had a bad rep on Wall Street and was criticized for its inability to execute on otherwise quite good ideas. This was the case, that is, until the company turned to the results pyramid as a guide to change its culture. Alaris executives discussed with every manager how to create the right experiences to foster the desired beliefs, which would in turn produce effective actions, and ultimately achieve the company’s desired target results. Once the program was introduced, every employee at every level was motivated, optimistic and determined to get results and execute. Within six months, Alaris had completely turned their reputation around! So what kind of culture exactly should you be thinking about implementing within your organization? The key is in the last line of General Motor’s reformed strategy: “Be accountable.” Accountability is vital to a strong organizational culture, and it is shaped by every action an employee performs. In organizations, a thin line separates great companies from poor ones. In general, there are two modes of acting: above the line and below the line. Only one promotes accountability. By acting above the line, we can move toward accountability in four simple steps. First, we have to see it, by considering other people’s viewpoints, communicating honestly and candidly, exchanging feedback and hearing the difficult truths that expose the real circumstances at hand. Second, we need to own it by accepting the goals and priorities of the organization’s mission as one’s own. Only then are we able to solve it, by asking what else we could do to get the results we want. Finally, we’ve got to do it, and perform the tasks we said we would, focus on our priorities and be reliable and trustworthy.   When everyone in an organization decides of their own free will to take above the line steps, you’ll have a culture of accountability. While your company should strive for above the line actions, below the line actions will only harm your organizational culture. When we act below the line, we refuse to accept responsibility and instead become obsessed with blame games, cycles of finger pointing and employees playing the victim. Of course, acting below the line is also human. But by remaining below the line, you’ll tread in dangerous waters regarding accountability. Accountability shouldn’t make the question, “Who’s accountable for this?” sound like a punishment. It should instead be empowering. Accountability isn’t about “getting caught” or failing, but should be approached as playing a starring role in reaching a solution. In a world where being first means everything, you can’t take your time implementing a culture change. But equally importantly, you can’t take shortcuts, either! Too often, leaders try to change the way people act to get the results they want without working to change the way people think or what they believe. So while employees might appear involved, they won’t actually be committed to the company’s cause. This means that only the top of the results pyramid is being addressed – actions and results – while the pyramid’s two fundamental elements – experiences and beliefs – are being neglected.   To better understand why this doesn’t work, let’s call R1 your current results, as produced by the current culture, C1. Then let’s call R2 the desired results that you’ll get with C2, the new culture. It’s impossible to get results with your current culture, C1. So to create C2, you have to create new experiences, E2, and new beliefs, B2. Only these can effectively shape new actions, A2, to generate improved results, R2, as your new culture, C2, emerges.    Creating a shift in experiences and beliefs takes more effort. But it will yield substantial, long-lasting changes that will then create a firm foundation for the results you want. This process occurs on different scales and at different speeds for different companies. Think of assuming a new approach to your organization’s culture as a transition and not as a transformation. An optical retailer wanted to test a new organizational culture, and so the company ran a pilot in a few retail stores. After two months, business improved more than 5 percent. The change in culture had led to the desired R2; results, as employees were thinking and acting differently with regard to daily work. Soon thereafter, the retailer took the change company-wide. How can you get everyone in your organization to rally around those key R2 results? Simply: alignment. Think of alignment as the guiding beliefs and deliberate actions that an organization applies to a clear and common goal. When people are all on the same page, following the same goals, there’s less stress, decision making is faster and more efficient, and other processes across the organization also speed up. In this way, alignment is vital for effective cultural change. Still not clear on why this is the case? Think about what happens when you have confusion about your goals. This can kill the momentum in your push for change. Why? Because nobody’s aligned. They don’t know where to push, or in which direction to go. For instance, fast-food chain Fast Grill wanted to improve its profit margins so the company could expand. During a meeting, the author asked Fast Grill’s top management what key results the company was aiming for. They all replied “profit margins.” Seems aligned, right? But when the author followed up and asked what the exact margin goal was, everyone in management gave different answers! Fast Grill management’s confusion led to poor execution, below the line behavior, and thus slow change. To avoid this situation, ensure that everyone’s on the same page and totally aligned! Remember: alignment is a process, not an event. It is something you must constantly work to achieve. If you want to guide a culture change in your organization, there are certain skills you’ll need as a leader. Having such skills are key to accelerating the process and enhancing your overall leadership. So what are these skills? The first thing you’ll need to take your organization from C1 to C2 is the skill to lead the change. In other words, you can’t just assign the responsibility to another department. As a leader, it’s up to you to keep abreast with everything going on as part of the change at every level. When you’re leading a change on such a major scale, you’ll no doubt receive criticism. To deal with this, you’ll need the skill to respond back. There are five steps you should take in response to feedback, to ensure everyone is aligned toward C2. First, you must identify the beliefs you want others to share. Second, you need to communicate this belief; and third, you should portray the experience you’re going to deliver to your employees. Fourth, you need to ask for feedback on the planned experience, and finally, enroll employees in providing feedback as the plan progresses. The final necessary skill to lead a change is the skill to be facilitative. You want meaningful dialogue about the culture change in your organization? Then you’ve got to encourage dialogue, teamwork and collaboration. Sony VAIO wanted to improve repair-related customer satisfaction scores by 15 percent over the previous year. Steven Nickel, VAIO Service vice president, energized the organization around R2 by opening the door to an ongoing dialogue. Many team members who had never spoken up in meetings before enthusiastically shared numerous improvement ideas, and VAIO Service ultimately exceeded its goal. Making all these plans and implementing a change means nothing if you can’t sustain it! There are three simple steps to ensure you integrate C² practices into the everyday life of your organization. First, list all the meetings, policies and procedures that the organization has. Second, find where you can integrate a culture change into your organizational systems. And finally, apply the changes into the activities you’ve selected. Eastside Health Plans offers an example of this three-step process. After the Eastside management team evaluated the first two steps in the integration process, they arrived at a plan. The team took early steps to align their organizational systems as well, from administration to meetings to human resources. For the first time in 25 years, leaders began to create significant experiences that suggested the company would not tolerate waste. Teams were formed to address waste as well as inefficiencies and administrative costs within the organization. These teams ultimately achieved line-item cost savings of over $200 million! If you can integrate a culture change effectively, your employees won’t see it as just another annoying management program. Instead, it will become an enjoyable part of life at work. For example, one of the author’s daughters took a job at a local bookstore and shared with him how much she enjoyed the culture at her new job. When asked what she enjoyed the most, she explained that whenever an employee saw another employee doing a good job, they could give that employee a token, to earn free products from the store. In fact, the store was one of the father’s clients, and one that had integrated a culture of accountability into their organization so successfully that the culture became a positive aspect of an employee’s day! The key message in this book: Take your organization to its full potential by implementing a culture change and fostering accountability across all levels. By considering relationships between experiences, beliefs, actions and results, steps can be taken toward building and then sustaining a new organizational culture. Actionable advice: Take it step by step! To help ensure accurate alignment around key decisions with everyone in an organization, the leadership alignment process is a useful guide. Step one is participation, where you get the appropriate people involved. Step two is accountability, where you identify those who will make decisions. Step three is discussion, in which you make sure that people are able to speak up and are heard. Step four is ownership, where you promote the decision as your own. Step five involves communication, to ensure that your message is consistent. And finally, step 6 is follow-up, where you check in with your organization and test for appropriate alignment across all areas. Suggested further reading: How to Be a Positive Leader by Jane E.

When the author, Richard Sheridan, was a manager at a software company, Interface Systems, he dreaded work so much he changed his route to the office. Turning off the highway, he’d drive backroads and head into the countryside before reluctantly arriving at work. He soon realized there simply had to be a better approach to work and leadership. Sheridan came to dream of leading an organization in which people could find real joy. At Menlo Innovations, the software firm that the author founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he’s achieved his dream. These blinks recount how he leads his business with a focus on joy and optimism. Sheridan describes how it’s possible to cultivate leadership that ignores fear, hierarchy and bureaucracy, and cares instead about creativity and personal authenticity. In these blinks, you’ll understand how, with the right values, approaches and systems, it’s possible for anyone to do the same. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the author’s ten-year-old self taught him about business; why humility is a key leadership quality; and why interview candidates should be encouraged to care for one another. Do you show your authentic self in the workplace? Or are office-you and home-you different people? Too many people feel unable to be their authentic selves in the workplace. A local non-profit organization called Ele’s Place once visited Menlo, the author’s company, to share its story. Ele’s Place helps young people process grief after the loss of a family member. One of the exercises they run uses a white plastic mask, the kind you might see at a costume party. The teenagers are encouraged to write, on the outside of the mask, what emotions they shared with the world. Things like ‘I’m feeling better,’ or, ‘I’m hanging in there.’ But on the inside of the masks, the children would write how they really felt with sentences like ‘when will the hurt stop?’ or simply, ‘scared.’ When they shared their masks, they realized – often for the first time – that other people experienced the same feelings. The exercise allowed them to be authentic in a safe environment, and therefore to process their overwhelming emotions. Sharing our true emotional state – the inside of our masks – in the workplace is hard, particularly for leaders who feel they should – like the hurting teenagers – put on a brave face and hide their vulnerabilities. Read the outside of a leader’s mask, and it might say words like ‘confident,’ ‘ambitious’ or ‘strong.’ But inside? Words like ‘stressed,’ ‘anxious’ and ‘overwhelmed’ might show up. And just like with the teenagers, perhaps they might take comfort in sharing their masks with their colleagues and fellow leaders. It may be counterintuitive to embrace the vulnerabilities that come with true authenticity. The next important leadership value, humility, may also appear to go against good business practice. If your business is humble, won’t your more confident competitors trample all over you? Well, for the author, humility is all about considering others and acknowledging that all work in a business is noble. That’s why the author often cleans up after client lunches. It’s why every morning, he empties the office dishwasher. If keeping things tidy is a behavior he wants to instill in his organization, he should be willing to follow through on that himself. As a result, he has a happy team, content in the knowledge that he’s humble enough to do anything that he might ask of them. What color hat do you wear? The psychologist and philosopher Edward de Bono wrote a book, first published in 1985, called Six Thinking Hats, in which he set out six different approaches to thinking through any situation. The white hat-wearing thinker, for example, sees any situation solely through a prism of cold hard facts. Someone wearing a red hat, by contrast, would consider only the emotion of the moment. The black hat is often regarded as the engineering mindset, considering all that could go wrong, how and why. We need this kind of thinking. Without it, buildings in earthquake zones would topple. But leaders can’t afford to get bogged down with this thinking alone. They need to put their yellow hats on, too. The yellow hat is an optimistic outlook that is oriented toward success, considering from the start that success is a strong possibility. When an organization has plenty of people looking at things from the perspective of a white, red or black hat, sometimes it needs its leader to be wearing a yellow hat, so that they can provide optimism and engagement. In practical terms, that can involve just saying, “That seems like a great idea. Let’s do it.” Leaders from all over the world, from brands like GM, GE, Coca-Cola and McKinsey have visited the author’s company to learn how it built such a joyful culture, with minimal hierarchy and a highly engaged team. They’re usually inspired and ask what they could do as a leader that would make a difference. The author always says “abandon your office and move onto the floor with your people.” This advice is often met with nervous laughter, and the advice is rarely followed. But one visitor, Ron Sail, then-leader of GE Global Services in New York, did just that. He gave up his own office, tore down the rest of the walls dividing his team, and embraced face-to-face conversations and team spirit. The result? His team loved him. Others at GE now want to emulate his way of working. GE even named a training center after him. By tearing down walls, Ron had embraced the optimism and joy that said, “why not just try it?” So embrace optimism. If you have an idea for something that might make your organization more joyful, don’t get stuck in black-hat thinking and examine every way it might go wrong. Just do it. In 1968, the author’s mom ordered a new bookshelf. At that time, getting new furniture was a big deal, and his mom was excited. The author decided he would surprise his parents while they were out. So, at just ten years old, he carefully assembled the bookcase himself, arranged some books, hooked up their stereo and had his mom’s favorite record playing when they walked in. His dad looked on, speechless, and his mom actually cried. It was a joyful moment to see their reactions. This moment taught him a lesson that has influenced his business career – that true joy comes not from creating things for ourselves, but from serving others. So, try to build a culture focused on serving people. There’s an old story about three bricklayers, which shows how this instills joy. A passerby asked the three men what they were doing. The first replied that he was laying bricks. The second one said that he was building a wall. The third? With a wide, proud smile, he said that he was creating a cathedral. The third man was joyful because he felt that his work was serving others. This goes to show it’s possible to focus on serving others, whatever your business or your role. That’s even the case if you’re doing something as simple as cleaning tables. The author used to indulge in a McDonald’s meal when he would fly out of the Detroit airport. He always noticed an older McDonald’s worker, Mike. His job was to clean away trash and wipe tables – mundane but important tasks he did with great care. But he didn’t just keep things clean. He served. If he saw that you didn’t have a napkin, he’d offer to get you one. Then he’d make small talk, and wish you a pleasant flight – small touches, perhaps, but a remarkable attitude nonetheless. Once, the author noticed that a younger man had taken Mike’s place. And, to the author’s surprise, this man also went out of his way to offer assistance and a kind word. When the author tracked down the branch manager, the manager said that it was no coincidence. He felt a little kindness and care went a long way in a competitive retail environment, so he’d established a culture built around service. The branch manager wasn’t just a manager. By building an effective culture, he showed that he was a leader. Let’s take a look at that crucial difference in more detail. What’s the difference between a leader and a boss? Well, a boss tells you what to do using the authority of their position. A leader influences and motivates. A boss demands adherence, whereas a leader cultivates thinking, teamwork and a lets-get-things-done-together attitude. While a boss tends to be at the top of a hierarchy, leaders can be found at every level. There are plenty of reasons why an organization that cultivates leaders, rather than bosses, will be more effective. One is that an organization with a leadership culture will be more likely to experiment. In a boss-oriented workplace, if you want to try something new and exciting, you have to get the boss’ permission. That’s problematic, because if permission is regularly sought but denied, then at some point people will stop seeking it, and innovations will die before they’re proposed. But in a leadership-oriented organization, there’s little requirement for formal permission, and no blame culture when ideas are tried but go wrong. In the author’s previous role at Interface Systems, he hung a poster on the wall that said “Make Mistakes Faster.” At first, still thinking like a boss, he wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. He didn’t really want more, faster mistakes – he wanted the opposite. But eventually, he came to realize that trying to avoid small mistakes was actually slowing things down and contributing to large, costly errors. In a leader-oriented culture, mistakes are expected and dealt with by teams happy to roll up their sleeves and work together to correct them or learn from them. Prioritizing leaders over bosses means having a non-hierarchical culture. At Menlo Innovations, the whole team is empowered to make decisions, rather than deferring to and seeking permission from just one or two bosses. At Menlo, for example, interviews are conducted by the whole team, as are performance reviews and other key decisions. It’s such a radically non-hierarchical organization that when a guest asked Menlo team members who they reported to, they were stumped. One said, unsure, “I guess the customers?” Another ventured that they reported to the process itself. Then, almost in unison, they all pointed to each other. “We report to each other,” they said. Menlo is living proof that an organization without bosses can work. But to get it right, you need strong systems. When you think about what brings you joy, systems probably don’t immediately spring to mind. If you want to make your organization joyful, though, focusing on systems is actually a great step to take. Unfortunately, systems are often overlooked when businesses are faced with challenges like a failed sales pitch or a harsh customer complaint. These are often put down to chance or lack of work ethic. A good leader, however, will consider that it might be the result of a flawed system. System thinkers approach an organization in terms of its systems and processes. They consider the way work is allocated and monitored, or how certain tasks can be made simpler. Systems thinkers are always looking for ways to make things better. Take Menlo’s time tracking system, for example. Every week, everyone in the business submits a timesheet detailing the time they worked on each task, accurate to every fifteen minutes. This simple system enables them to make reliable predictions about the time needed for future projects. This reduces the need for excessive overtime, which in turn reduces bugs in software and the anxiety and low morale that come from being overworked. So, systems are important. But how do you design them in a way that brings joy? Well, one key factor is to create policies that reward the positive behaviors that you want to encourage. The author once advised Dominique Coster, an R&D team leader for an automotive supplier, on how to generate the kind of team collaboration that Menlo enjoys. Coster had taken the author’s advice, by opening up the office space to facilitate more spontaneous conversation. As a result, team collaboration improved. But after a few months, things had stalled. The author stumbled upon a solution when he asked Coster what they celebrated as a team. The answer was that each time a patent was issued, the individual who had been granted the patent received a plaque, often presented by senior management flown in from Tokyo. Bingo! The author pointed out that while Coster wanted to cultivate team thinking, he was celebrating individual achievement. Soon after, Coster’s team started rewarding the whole team behind the patents, from engineers to accountants. They changed their system, and behavior in the organization changed as a result. Do the people in your organization truly care about one another? If not, have you considered how much more joyful your workplace would be if they did? To build an ethos of caring for one another, consider the systems you have in place relating to your people. Recruitment would be a great place to start. Potential recruits at Menlo are given a clear message about the company's ethos from the beginning. In their first interview, candidates work in pairs to complete a joint task. They’re also given clear instructions – they might be competing, but they must help one another in order to get a second interview. If one partner is struggling, the other should help them out. If one seems nervous, the second should try to put them at ease. Employees learn from their very first encounter with Menlo that it’s an organization in which colleagues look out for one another’s interests rather than their own. They quickly learn to embrace the shared responsibility of supporting one another. For example, one Menlo employee was struggling with punctuality, and occasionally not making it to the office at all due to problems at home. In many businesses, the situation may have resulted in a firing. At Menlo, though, another colleague volunteered to pick the employee up every morning and bring him to the office. This gave the troubled employee the extra push he needed to make it to work, probably saving him his job. On other occasions, caring for others simply means thinking about each other as people, not just as employees. The author’s assistant, Anna, coordinates his life and helps arrange his busy schedule of international speaking engagements, as well as tours and visits to Menlo’s offices. In 2015, the author gave over 40 talks around the world. He enjoyed the work, but it was a bit too much for him. Before he even had to say anything, Anna told the author she was refusing any requests for December that would involve travel. Having some family time, she said, was more important for him. Caring is important. But so is sharing – specifically, sharing knowledge and experience. Your business may be under threat, and you don’t even know it. Borders Books was founded in 1971. Hugely successful, in its last year of operation it employed almost 20,000 people. Amazon was only founded in 1994, but by 2011 it had put Borders out of business. Borders had 17 years to learn how to survive in a new, internet-dominated world. But it couldn’t. If there’s one lesson to learn from this, it’s that leaders need to be active, continual learners. As Peter Senge, a systems scientist at MIT, says, the only long-term source of competitive advantage is a business’ ability to learn more quickly than its competition. So, how can you build a learning culture? First, try to establish strong reading habits within your team to generate excitement and imagination about new ideas. The author’s co-founder, James Goebel, sometimes comments that Menlo never invented anything. They stole every idea they ever had from a book. There are a couple of practical things you can do to build a reading culture. The first is simply to make books available. Create a free library. Don’t worry if books go missing. If a particular favorite is always unavailable, buy a second copy. You can then go one step further and start an in-house book club, or a “lunch and learn” session, where one team member shares insights from a book they’ve read. Not only is this a great way to spread new ideas, but it can also help build presentation skills. The second is to let your people teach each other. The most important thing that Menlo has done to enable a learning culture is pairing its people together. Almost all colleagues, from programmers to project managers, work in pairs. Programmers work with other programmers, and project managers work with other project managers. They sit together and work through each task. And because pairs change every week, colleagues are constantly learning. They learn from one another’s experiences, strengths and even weaknesses. When someone has an idea, they must lead their paired colleague toward it, thinking out loud, articulating their vision and answering questions. This makes continuous learning part of the process. And that doesn’t just make your business more resilient and prepared for the future. It creates a business in which people are constantly enjoying learning and teaching, exchanging views and expanding their horizons – a business that brings joy. The key message in these blinks: Too many people face their workday with a sense of dread. But it doesn’t have to be this way. If you’re a leader, there are some simple things you can do to build a culture that generates joy. You can abandon the old ways of doing things that rely on hierarchy, bureaucracy and fear, and embrace a model in which people have a sense of purpose, can take responsibility, learn from one another and constantly improve. You can create joy at work. Actionable advice: Give equal bonuses.  One of the most important things you can do to build a joyful culture is to give equal bonuses – not as a percentage of pay, but equal amounts. That tells everyone that each person contributes something valuable to the business, from the smartest engineer to the assistant who answers the phone so pleasantly when a potential client calls.

Unfortunately, however, most coaches don’t realize that coaching can be greatly beneficial to both the person being coached and the person doing the coaching. And this is where the co-active coaching model comes in. Co-active coaching is more about discovery and development than about solving problems. It’s about finding things out together.  So how does it work? As these blinks will show you, this model is based on a number of different skills, all of which combine to create the kind of conversation that will help the client grow. Foremost among these skills is listening. Of equal importance is curiosity. But there are more. Read on and learn what they are. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why an environment of trust is essential in good coaching; that the skill of listening is underrated; and why dumb questions are sometimes the best ones. Every effective coaching relationship is built on collaboration and trust. And in the upcoming blinks, you’ll learn exactly how to build such a relationship with your client. The authors use the term co-active to describe a process in which both the client and the coach actively collaborate together: both are involved in the process. Ultimately, co-active coaching is not centered on problem-solving, but on conversation. Of course, you’ll be addressing issues and finding solutions, but the process is primarily about awareness, discover and choice. That process starts when you familiarize yourself with the four cornerstones of the co-active coaching model: First, you have to begin by assuming that all people are inherently creative and resourceful. We are all capable of finding answers, making choices and learning from our mistakes.  Secondly, remember that there’s more to a coaching relationship than just problem-solving. Try to see the bigger picture: there are many different factors that impact a client’s life – things like work, family, emotions and so on.  Third: when you’re talking to your client, make sure you pay attention to subtle details like tone, mood and body language – and not just on the content of the conversation. The co-active conversation can only work if you create a safe, trusting space that allows for vulnerability; such a space depends on your being tuned into your conversational partner.  And finally, encourage transformation. Even if your client hired you to work with them on one specific area, having a broad vision will allow you to nudge them toward more holistic, and therefore valuable, change.  So, all in all, the world of co-active coaching isn’t about “fixing” clients; it’s about helping them discover and develop their true selves. In order to conduct a fruitful conversation with your client, you must first design an effective coaching environment. In co-active coaching, we like to encourage our clients to take risks. But remember: risks are only taken by people who feel safe. The best way to foster a nurturing environment that encourages risk-taking is to ensure confidentiality, trust, honesty and spaciousness.  Those are crucial qualities: fostering confidentiality will allow your client to speak freely – the only way to spark a process of discovery and change.  Similarly, clients expect honesty: being nice isn’t what wins clients’ trust; you have to be willing to speak out when the emperor isn’t wearing any clothes. One more thing to remember: in order to learn from their mistakes and move forward, clients need enough space to experiment and confront past failures.  In addition to creating an effective coaching environment, it’s also crucial to set the terms of your working relationship; that means the ground rules and your expectations should be clear from the very beginning.  To that end, you should set aside a special discovery session before you dive into the coaching process. Here, you can talk openly with your client about your working relationship and discuss the terms.  You can get the conversation going by asking simple but powerful questions – things like, “Where would you like to make a difference in your life?” or, “How does failure affect you?” Such questions will prompt clients to reflect on where they are and where they’re headed; it’ll also give you a sense of their strengths and weaknesses.  The discovery session is also a perfect time to talk about administrative matters like scheduling, cancellation and more. That way, you and your client can be on the same page and avoid future misunderstandings.  Think about the last time someone was totally with you, truly listening to what you were saying. This powerful experience is surprisingly rarely, isn’t it? Well, as a coach, it’s your job to deliver that kind of experience to your client. Meaning, you have to learn to read between the lines, listening deeply for the meaning behind every story. To help you do this, the authors distinguish three levels of listening: At level I, you’re focusing on yourself. You listen to what the other person has to say, but you’re mainly concerned with what the conversation means to you personally.  For instance, let’s say your client is having trouble balancing his personal and professional life. If you’re at the first level of listening, you might end up offering advice that’s based on your own life – how, for example, you successfully juggle the demands of work and family.  At level II, you’re wholly focused on the other person; and as a coach, your awareness is totally directed to your client.  Continuing with the previous example: listening at level II, a coach will respond to the client’s dilemma by working with the client to examine the available solutions in order to better understand why the client feels trapped. In other words, this level of listening is about empathy, clarification and collaboration.  Finally, at level III, the coach draws on their intuition to gather information that’s not directly observable. At this level, you deeply understand your client’s dilemma and the internal dynamics behind it. You can sense the energy and emotions, both spoken and unspoken, driving the issue at hand.  As you can see, listening empathetically is at the crux of coaching. That’s the only way to understand whether your client’s on-track with their goals and living according to their values. Co-active coaches learn to switch constantly between levels II and III; and once they understand what’s really going on, they guide their client to articulate it themselves. As a coach, your intuition is one of the most valuable tools at your disposal. Intuition is a gut feeling that can’t always be backed up by evidence or facts. And to act on it, you first need to interpret it.  Start by simply noticing your intuition and drawing attention to it. That way, you create space to talk about any hunch you have, without letting it fly under the radar.  The way you interpret an intuition will help you articulate it. However, don’t get too attached to the meaning you assign your hunches.  For instance, let’s say you and your client are having a conversation. Your intuition informs you that  something isn’t right here and you interpret this as a sign that your client isn’t telling you something. Test your hunch by asking, point blank, whether your client is holding something back.  It doesn’t matter whether your interpretation is correct or incorrect. The key is to use your intuition as a jumping-off point for deeper conversation and understanding.  Sometimes, you might even want to interrupt the conversation, blurting out a hunch immediately and thereby creating a dramatic shortcut in the coaching conversation, thus leading to surprising new insights. After all, you don’t want the conversation to move on to an entirely new phase, while you’re sitting on your hands worrying about whether or not your gut is telling you the right thing.  Because the thing is, in coaching it’s better to dive in headfirst. Don’t worry about looking a little clumsy – it will only make you seem more human and authentic. Imagine a dinner party: you’re seated next to a stranger who is infinitely curious about your life, your work, your instincts. For most of us, that level of curiosity is not only flattering – it’s also encouraging.  And expressing curiosity when you’re with your client is exactly what will allow her to let down her guard and open up, creating a deeper connection between the two of you. This is why co-active coaches cultivate a spirit of genuine curiosity and playfulness with their clients. There’s a big difference between a conventional, interview-style format and a more personal, curiosity-driven approach. The former entails asking questions like, “What areas will your report focus on?” The curious version, in contrast, would be, “How important will finishing the report be to you?” As you can see, tapping into your curiosity will help you find powerful questions that spark meaningful conversation. Let’s say your client is complaining – once again – about how helpless she feels in the face of her “impossible” work situation. You’re familiar with this story. So you ask, “What are you getting out of this situation?” You can also say, “Is this the only way this can be?” These are examples of the kinds of powerful questions that tend to shake people out of autopilot. So, don’t be surprised if there’s a sudden silence; the client will need a little time to think before they respond.  It’s also worth noting that, sometimes, the most powerful questions are so simple they almost sound stupid. For instance, imagine you and your client are discussing a tricky problem. The client knows all the intricacies of the issue and so has rehearsed answers to every question.  In this situation, simple questions are surprisingly effective. Some examples: What does the ideal resolution look like? What to do you do next? What can you learn from this? What’s key is getting the client to see the situation anew. Who doesn’t want fulfillment? Fulfillment is like a delicious dinner: satisfying, tasty and profoundly filling. And yet, unlike a great meal, fulfillment can be difficult to achieve and scary to pursue.  As a co-active coach, your number-one goal should be to challenge clients to chase their fulfillment – to find a path that allows them to fully express their true selves.  That means you have to work with clients to help them discover and articulate their values. The question is, what’s essential for each individual? If your client values risk-taking, chances are they want a life filled with adventure. If they value family, then they probably want to preserve a healthy balance between work and home.  As you can see, values and fulfillment are deeply linked. In a nutshell, fulfillment is about living a life that’s in tune with one’s values.  And thus, for a coach, understanding a client’s values is a huge advantage. As clients make choices, their values can function as a litmus test. So when a client faces an important decision, ask him to evaluate to what extent each potential course reflects his values. After all, any decision made on the basis of the client’s values will be inherently more fulfilling.  Of course, this raises an important question: how to help the client discover his values in the first place? Well, the best way to clarify values is to find them in the client’s own experiences. Make it a natural, exploratory process – don’t just plop a checklist in front of the person! And then, after you come up with the initial set of values, you can have your client rank them in order of importance. This way, your client will be able to reflect on what matters most in their lives. The key message: Co-active coaching is about establishing a collaborative relationship with your clients to effectively empower them to find their own answers; your task is also to encourage and support your clients as they make choices to become more in-tune with their personal values. Actionable advice: Spend half an hour at a coffee shop practicing your curiosity. Watch people and try to imagine their values, their hobbies, their obstacles and their dreams. Then at the end of the half hour, find someone you can spend more time with; use this as an opportunity to indulge your curiosity by asking questions.  Pay attention to how the person responds to your curiosity and then reflect on what you’ve learned.

Thinking about success this way can make it seem rather daunting. After all, your chances of starting the next industry-conquering giant, creating the next viral product sensation or becoming the next multibillion-dollar start-up founder are pretty slim. But do you really want to be that big? Do you want your life to revolve around making money, finding new markets and managing large organizations on an ever-increasing scale? Or would you rather be able to enjoy the independence of owning your own company without having to sacrifice your life on the altar of the “bigger is better” definition of success? Would you rather be able to work a limited number of hours per year and spend the rest of them doing other things you care about, such as enjoying quality time with your family, traveling or pursuing hobbies? If these questions leave you intrigued by the notion of thinking smaller about success, then these blinks are for you! In them, you’ll learn how to turn a side gig into a profitable, sustainable small-scale company; how to find a sense of satisfaction with your work; and how to do all of that without needing loads of money to get started. The ethos of modern capitalism can be summarized in a single word: “more.” On one side of the economic equation, there’s the average consumer, who’s continually seeking to buy more products and services to consume. On the other side, there’s the average business, which is continually seeking to sell more products and services to grow its profits. The moment it reaches one revenue goal, it sets the target even higher – $1 million, then $10 million and so forth. In short, nothing is ever enough. Consumers and businesses alike are driven by an insatiable desire for evermore consumption and growth – generally speaking, at least. There are exceptions. Joining the chorus of consumers who are trying to limit their consumption, some businesses are also starting to say “enough is enough.” In lieu of endless expansion, they’re seeking a more stable, satiable, and sustainable approach to growth. By exercising self-restraint, these businesses can pursue a financial goal that turns the traditional corporate model on its head. That goal is simple: to earn just enough revenue to enable their owners and employees to secure the amount of comfort, autonomy and free time that they want their lives to have. By turning that desire into the center of gravity around which their operations are focused, these businesses are able to revolve around the individuals who run them, rather than the other way around. Those individuals become the businesses’ unit of measure – a unit of one. Whether they consist of a single owner-operator, a team of a couple hundred employees or something in between, we can therefore call them companies of one. Counterintuitively, whereas most businesses set ever-escalating growth targets, companies of one set firm growth limits to keep themselves small. For example, Sean D’Souza runs a company of one called Psychotactics, which provides consultancy services. His growth limit is $500,000 in profit per year. Even though he could make more money if he wanted to, he purposefully chose to restrict his company to this profit goal. Why not more? Well, to borrow a famous line from rapper the Notorious B.I.G.: more money, more problems. Generally speaking, more profits require more production, sales and customers, which, in turn, require more employees, infrastructure and bureaucracy. That means more exhaustion, oversight and work time, which means less comfort, autonomy and free time. And that defeats the whole purpose of starting a company of one! For his part, D’Souza would rather be playing with his kids and taking three-month vacations. If you feel a similar way, then a company of one might be the way for you to go as well! A “company of one” might sound like a fancy way of calling oneself a small business or a freelancer – but there are important distinctions between these three forms of self-employment. When a small business stays small, it’s usually considered a limited success. Some small businesses are OK with that, but many would like to expand their operations, grow their profits and be more successful, in the “bigger is better” definition of success. If given opportunities to become bigger, many small businesses would seize them in a heartbeat. In contrast, companies of one would decline them if they’d already reached their growth limits. For them, staying small isn’t a mark of failure; it’s part of their very definition of success: achieving and sustaining a self-defined level of income. However, a small business and a company of one do have one important thing in common: they both seek profits. They invest a certain amount of time or money in their operations, and they eventually get more money out of them, if all goes well. Usually, that investment requires an upfront expenditure of labor. For a company of one, that could mean designing t-shirts, developing software or producing an online learning course. Once the products are finished, the company can start reaping money from them without needing to do much further work – especially if they’re data-based ones that can be reproduced with virtually no additional labor. In contrast, a freelancer generally stops earning income the moment she stops working. She gets paid a certain amount of money either per hour or per piece of work, which requires a certain amount of time to complete. Either way, her time is money – and her money requires time. Unlike a company of one, a freelancer generally doesn’t get to profit off her product after she’s done working on it. A freelance web designer, for instance, doesn’t get to design a single website and then sell it to multiple buyers; she just enters into a one-time transaction with her client. When it’s done, it’s done, and she moves on to the next client or project. Meanwhile, a company-of-one owner might be off surfing while he’s still earning money for work he did months ago! So freelancing is very different from running a company of one – but the former can be a good stepping stone to the latter, as we’ll see in the next blink. From this point on, we’re going to examine the process of starting a company of one from beginning to end, step by step. Along the way, we’ll look at some of the distinguishing features, goals and strategies of a successful company of one. The first step involves not doing something: namely, don’t quit your day job. Like many companies of one, your new business is probably going to grow out of a side gig. It needs to develop into a sustainable enterprise before you can turn it into a full-fledged company of one and devote yourself to it full-time. Consider Tom Fishburne, who worked in marketing for 20 years. In his free time, he pursued a hobby he’d loved since he was a child: cartooning. At first, he just did it for fun. Then he started taking side gigs, drawing for clients on the weekends and evenings. He didn’t quit his job to pursue cartooning full-time until he’d built up a solid roster of clients and saved up enough money to create a runway buffer – sufficient savings to cover one’s living expenses in the event of a slow month or two. That was seven years ago. Since then, he’s been making twice or even thrice as much money as he ever made as a marketing executive, while enjoying plenty of time with his family and doing something he loves – drawing cartoons for other businesses that want to use them for marketing. This work is part of running Marketoonist, a company of one based in his peaceful, sunny home in Marin County, California. Tom runs the company with his wife, and they sometimes employ freelancers on an as-needed basis – but that’s as far as their expansion has gone. They have a waiting list of clients, so they could definitely make more money if they expanded their operations further. But Tom and his wife don’t want to become the next corporate giant. They just want to enjoy their lives. For Tom, that means cartooning – not managing a gigantic workforce or a network of satellite offices. Tom’s story brings up an important lesson: if further growth would entail making sacrifices that are unacceptable to you, then that’s a clear sign that your company of one has reached its growth limit! Of course, at this point, when you’re just developing a side gig, you’re still a long way off from having to worry about achieving too much growth. So while keeping Tom’s lesson in mind, let’s take a look at the next step in your journey. Now that you’ve resisted the urge to quit your day job, what’s the next step in pursuing a side gig that can grow into a company of one? Well, first you need to find the gig, if you don’t have one already. At this point, your initial inclination might be to listen to the standard advice of business writers and speakers: follow your passion. There’s just one little problem with that advice. Unless you happen to be passionate about something that’s an in-demand, marketable skill, pursuing your passion is probably not going to be a financially viable option. Most people’s passions are out of sync with the demands of the market. Consider a 2003 study by Robert Vallerand, a professor of psychology at the University of Quebec. He asked the students of his university, “What are your passions?” Rather than their majors, most students answered “sports, music or art.” Yet these fields represent only 3 percent of all jobs, so it would be impossible for most of them to successfully pursue these passions. This truth is as sobering as it is vital to remember. You might have a passion for playing tennis – but you’re probably not going to be the next Serena Williams. The same goes for other passions involving activities that only a tiny percentage of people can earn a living from doing. You have to be practical. Ask yourself, what’s something that you’re already good at doing and that other people will pay you to do? If the answer is “nothing,” then what could you get better at doing and turn into a marketable skill? For the author, it was web designing. He didn’t feel passionate about it; he just worked at a design agency, and he’d gotten good at his job. In the course of leaving the agency and starting a web-design company of one, he refined his skill set and became better and better at solving his clients’ problems. This brought him a feeling of satisfaction and enthusiasm for doing the work and seeing the results – a feeling that’s a form of passion! In other words, don’t wait for a financially viable career path to magically materialize from your passion; instead, focus on identifying and developing a marketable skill set now, and allow your passion to emerge from the process of refining, mastering and helping other people with it. In identifying and refining a marketable skill set, you might make a common assumption: the more people who want the product or service that your skill provides, the better. After all, the bigger the market, the bigger the number of potential customers. But by trying to appeal to everyone, you can end up appealing to no one. That’s because aiming yourself at the lowest common denominator means making your product or service as broadly appealing and therefore as generic as possible, which diminishes your brand’s allure. Even large companies can suffer from this. For example, Starbucks originally positioned itself as a chain of stores that offered people the experience of visiting a local, boutique coffee shop. But, around the mid-2000s, with ever more Starbucks stores sprouting up on seemingly every street-corner, and with ever more products on offer within them, the experience of visiting a Starbucks became rather bland. High-quality coffee began to be overshadowed by sandwiches, CDs and a profusion of fancy drinks, and its former semblance of local charm was belied by its ubiquity. Overstretched, the company began to flounder. By the end of the decade, it had closed about 900 stores. Since then, it’s scaled back and refocused on its original mission, having learned the hard way that you can’t be everything to everyone. If that’s not enough to dissuade you from chasing after a mass audience, consider the fact that larger markets attract larger hordes of competitors, which makes it even more difficult to stand out. So look for a niche instead. The smaller and more specific your target audience is, the easier it’ll be to connect and build trust with them. And the more distinct their needs are, the easier it’ll be to learn how to meet them. This will allow you to charge premium prices for your highly tailored, superlatively delivered products or services. That’s what successful e-commerce consultant Kurt Elster has done. Instead of offering general consulting services to all e-commerce businesses (an extremely mass audience), he’s increased his revenue eightfold by positioning himself as a consultant who works exclusively with businesses that use the Shopify e-commerce platform. Think about it this way: if you ran a business on Shopify, who would you rather hire as a consultant, a generalist who claims he can work with anyone – or a specialist like Elster who’s intimately familiar with the platform you use? To tighten the focus of your product or service even further, there are two more strategies you can pursue. The first is to adopt the virtue of simplicity. To see its power in action, consider the small company Casper, which sells mattresses online. Now, mattress companies are a dime-a-dozen – so what sets Casper apart? Well, to begin with, its audience isn’t everyone; it’s the mostly younger people who want a better night’s sleep but don’t want the hassle of visiting a physical mattress store. Then, there’s the way it offers its products: whereas many of its competitors present customers with an overwhelming number of options, Casper makes only three styles of mattresses. Having both narrowed its target audience and simplified their options, Casper then presents a straightforward proposition: upgrade your sleep by buying a better mattress online, avoid the headache of visiting a physical store and rest easy in the knowledge that you can return it for a full refund if you don’t like it after 100 nights. The second strategy involves further amplifying that uniqueness by leveraging your most powerful asset: yourself. You’ll need all the help you can get from it, because even within the smaller pond of a particular niche, you may still be a small fish compared to your competitors, who may be larger, established companies. Fortunately, you can use your apparent disadvantage to your advantage. Yes, you’re just a person – but, by the same token, you have a unique personality, which allows you to brand your enterprise, product or service in an equally unique way. To do this, take an aspect of your personality and integrate it into both your work and the messaging that surrounds it, so that it’s there in everything you do – from your product design or service delivery to your emails, tweets and conversations with your customers. Again, simplicity is the key; you should be able to describe your personality-driven brand with simple adjectives, such as “youthful,” “rebellious,” “sincere,” “competent,” “elegant” or “exciting,” which you can then put a unique spin on – one that’s an authentic expression of who you are. Remember: your competitors can offer similar skills, products or services, but they can’t replicate your personality, and your personality is what’s going to allow you to stand out from the crowd – so let it shine! Assuming you’ve identified your target audience and developed a marketable skill set, you’re now in a position to provide a product or service for which they would be willing to pay money. You just need to convince them to take advantage of your talents! Of course, that’s easier said than done, and there’s a whole process involved in reaching that point. First, you need to connect with your audience and learn about their needs, so you can know how to fulfill them. One way to do that is to reach out to potential clients and offer them free, no-strings-attached consultancy. For example, if you were trying to establish a web-design side gig that could turn into a company of one, you could begin by finding people who were looking for a web designer or had already found one. By having conversations with them about their experiences, you could learn a lot of useful information, such as the manner and places in which they’re searching for web designers, the factors behind their hiring decisions, the objectives they’re trying to fulfill, the problems that lead to bad customer experiences and the questions they have about the web-design process. By answering those questions, you could then begin to position yourself not just as a consultant, but as a trustworthy authority in your field – someone with valuable expertise from which other people can benefit and on which they can depend. But again, you’re not charging any money at this point; you’re not even offering or trying to subtly push your services. You’re genuinely just trying to help your audience, in small but meaningful ways. The word “small” is crucial here. You’re not redesigning someone’s entire website for free or anything like that. You’re just offering answers to questions, as well as advice, second opinions, brainstorming sessions and so forth – mini-consultations, you could call them. By doing all this, you’re both learning about your audience and building a reputation – and developing mutually beneficial relationships with them. Indeed, by the end of your mini-consultations, they’ve already helped you, and you’ve already helped them, and you haven’t even done any paid work for them yet! Having established these relationships and demonstrated their value, who do you think your audience will go to next time they need to pay for a web design service: a stranger – or you, the person they already know and trust as an authority in the field? In the author’s own experience, the answer was the latter; nearly everyone with whom he consulted went on to want to hire him. Once you’ve established your reputation, authority and relationships with potential clients, you’ve reached the point where you can start doing “real” business and actually make some money. So now it’s time to put the pedal to the metal – quitting your job, renting an office, ordering fancy business cards and so forth, right? Well, hold on. You should keep your job until your embryonic enterprise is more grown-up, and you should seriously reconsider making any large investments in it. They’re probably unnecessary. A slew of technological developments allow you to bypass large investments that would have been necessary in the past. A remote contractor can provide you with the services of an IT department. Free analytics software allows you to gain valuable insights into your website visitors without hiring a cyber guru. If you actually do need to make larger investments, then your plan is probably too grandiose. You should be thinking and behaving smaller at this point. As a future company of one, your goal isn’t to act like a traditional start-up that makes huge upfront investments in the hope of earning even huger profits in the distant future. Your goal is to become a profitable business as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. That’s because unlike a traditional start-up, you can’t rely on external investors pumping enormous injections of capital into your company. Ultimately, that’s a good thing, because it allows you to be much more independent than a start-up, which is beholden to its investors and needs to gain their approval before changing directions. But it also means you don’t have the luxury of burning through cash while you take months or even years to become profitable. The more time you spend getting set up to make money, the more time you’re not earning income from your business. And the more money you spend on establishing it, the more difficult it becomes to make an income. After all, the greater your upfront costs, the greater the revenue you need to generate to break even, let alone make a profit. It’s therefore imperative to roll out a sellable product or service as quickly and inexpensively as you can. It doesn’t need to be perfect – just good enough to get the ball rolling! Once it’s rolling, your business can then start to grow through a gradual snowball effect, which we’ll look at next. Your initial product or service will probably be a pretty modest affair: just a few clients, projects or sales from a small-scale product run. But those few clients, projects or sales can lead to more clients, projects or sales, which can lead to even more of them, and so forth and so on, leading to a snowball effect. That’s what happened for Alexandra Franzen, who left her career in radio broadcasting to become a professional writer about ten years ago. She didn’t succeed overnight; at the beginning, she landed only three projects. But each of those projects led to another and then another, as her initial clients hired her again or referred her to new clients. Fast-forward to the present, and she now has so many clients and projects that she has an almost year-long waiting list! A similar thing happened when Jeff Sheldon founded Ugmonk, a small and highly successful clothing company. With the help of a $2,000 loan, he created just four t-shirt designs and produced a small run of only 200 shirts, which quickly sold out. The success of this first run led to a second and then a third run, and he was able to pay back his loan and turn a profit almost immediately. While continuing to live off the income of his day job, he invested that profit back into his company, which allowed him to finance further production without further cost to himself. For the first two years, he ran Ugmonk out of his apartment. Only when he needed more space did he invest in a warehouse, which brings us to another important point: it’s OK to make larger investments in a company of one – but only when the time is right and they’re necessary. Instead of trying to anticipate everything you might need someday and invest in it upfront, just add new equipment, infrastructure, software, contractors or whatever the case might be as your needs arise and your revenue allows. But remember that, as a company of one with a purposefully limited size of operations and level of profit, you’re going to have to fulfill many of your business’s needs yourself. For example, unlike a large company, you can’t just delegate your marketing to a marketer or your customer service to a customer-service representative. You’ll have to become a jack-of-all-trades and take care of most of these things yourself. When you start off on the path of establishing a company of one, your main competitive edge is the extreme smallness of your enterprise, which allows you to be very personable with your clients and to focus on providing them with fantastic customer service. As your company grows, you might be tempted to scale back on that personableness and service – but you do so at your peril. After all, your personableness is a large part of what makes your company likable – and it’ll be hard to convince people to keep sending money your way if they stop liking you! Customer service, in turn, is crucial to succeeding in today’s economy. According to a recent survey conducted by the marketing research firm Harris Interactive, nine out of ten Americans are willing to spend more money on companies that provide excellent customer service, and 79 percent of them have declined a purchase because of bad service. Larger companies also run a risk of losing customers due to their lack of personableness and service, but many of them are fine with that because they adopt a churn and burn approach to their customers. This approach can be summarized as follows: get as many new customers as you can, and wring some money out of them as quickly as you can. If they get dissatisfied with you and leave, oh well – just find more customers to replace them and wring some more money out of them. Besides the questionable ethics of that approach, it’s also just not a viable strategy for a company of one. When your budget is small, customer retention is essential, because consumer research conducted by Econsultancy and Responsys shows it can cost five times as much to add a new customer than to keep an old one. Plus, there are the opportunity costs of customer attrition. On average, a loyal customer’s subsequent purchases make him worth ten times the amount of his initial purchase, according to a study conducted by the White House Office of Consumer Affairs. Finally, the happier you keep your customers, the more likely they are to refer you to other people – and such word-of-mouth referrals are the number-one way that small businesses acquire new customers, according to a study by Verizon and Small Business Trends. Indeed, they’re so powerful that they’re five times more effective than paid online advertisements in terms of boosting sales. So embrace your company’s smallness and continue to treat your customers like friends; as your greatest potential allies, they’ll more than return the favor! Companies of one are small-scale business enterprises that purposefully stay small in order to provide their owners with a sustainable income, a high degree of independence and a healthy work-life balance. Freelancing can be a good stepping stone to starting such an enterprise, and you can develop one by leveraging the power of a marketable skill set, a niche audience, mutually beneficial relationships, simplicity, personality, technology and great customer service.  Actionable advice: Apply the lessons of a Company of One to other areas of business.  You don’t have to be an actual company of one to act like a company of one. Large-scale companies can adopt some of the same principles, and individuals within those companies can apply them to their work as well. For example, the idea of getting a viable product or service to the market as quickly as possible will benefit both a tech-industry giant as a whole and a particular programmer working within it. If you work for a larger company, ask yourself: How can the other principles of a Company of One be applied to your organization or job? Got feedback?

What would you see? Horse-drawn coaches; no telephones; perhaps even hunter-gatherers looking for a square meal for the tribe. Our lives today are, of course, different. Innovations in technology and agriculture have made living in the modern world simpler and easier. One would think, therefore, that innovation equals progress. But is this true? These blinks show us that, although innovation is powerful, it hasn’t exactly made our lives better. What is needed to invent truly innovative products or services that make our lives truly better is a whole different type of thinking, called design thinking.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how being “thoughtless” could lead to thoughtful innovation; why thinking with your hands beats thinking with your head; and how sharing stories can get people to be more charitable. Many people understand innovation to be simply the process of inventing a new technology. When you have your new invention, then you have an “innovation.“ This view is far too simplistic. In contrast, design thinking offers you a method to approach the process of innovation, and thus achieve a more sophisticated understanding of innovation itself. Design thinking encourages us to take an integrative approach to innovation. This approach combines three overlapping “spaces,” through which a project may cycle several times. First comes inspiration. In this space, we consider a problem or opportunity, thinking about what we can do to solve the problem or bring the opportunity to fruition. Second is ideation. Here we develop our ideas and theories, and then put them to the test. Last is implementation. In this space, we introduce our idea to the market. You won’t march directly through these three spaces – rather, most innovations will pass through each space a number of times as part of the design thinking process. For example, during the process of ideation, you could develop a product with features that go beyond addressing your initial problem. In this case, you might want to revisit the inspiration process, to consider what different kinds of problems your product’s new feature could solve. To create an integrated solution, a design thinker must balance three aspects: feasibility, viability and desirability. Whereas a “normal” designer may resolve the different aspects of a project separately and one by one, a design thinker brings them all together as one harmonious solution. The gaming console Nintendo Wii offers an example of an integrated solution that perfectly balances feasibility, viability and desirability. Nintendo introduced gestural control to console gaming, which at the time was not only feasible (if not cutting-edge) but viable. The company also priced the console less than other machines on the market, while providing a more immersive experience for the player – thus making the Wii desirable for their target market. In the course of your design projects, you too should make this integrative approach the foundation of your design thinking. According to economist Peter Drucker, a designer’s job is to convert need into demand. Simple enough, yet how exactly does a designer go about doing this? Design thinking supposes that the best insights come from observation, or taking a closer look at how people live their daily lives. Psychologist Jane Fulton Suri says that we are so good at adapting our behaviors to inconvenient situations that we’re often not aware of the “thoughtless acts” that could trigger inspiration for the observant designer. Imagine an office worker trying to sort out the tangled chaos of cables under his desk by sticking a label to each one. He likely wouldn’t have come up with this solution had he been asked directly how to solve this particular problem. This is why observing people’s real-life behavior is so important. Observing provides meaningful insights into pressing needs. Yet design thinking goes beyond mere observation, in that it also invites people to engage in creating solutions to their own problems. Psychologist Abraham Maslow suggests that once a person’s basic needs are met, he will look instead for meaningful or emotionally satisfying experiences. From a design perspective, a great customer experience is one that fulfills these higher-order needs. But since every person has different needs and aspirations, design thinking proposes that we let people participate in creating their own customer experience to make it personally meaningful and engaging to them. Whole Foods Market, for example, is one of the most successful retailers in the United States, as the store provides an enriching shopping experience by offering free samples of products and a wide variety of healthy products that cater to customers’ lifestyles. At a Whole Foods Market location in Austin, Texas, the company is even experimenting with letting customers cook inside the store! This sort of hands-on approach allows customers to engage and thus gives them the opportunity to create their own meaningful experience. Many of us played with LEGOs as children, building our own dreamworlds brick by colorful brick. As adults, however, we do most of our inventing in our heads long before we employ our hands to realize our ideas concretely. Yet thinking with our hands, or prototyping, is a powerful strategy for design thinkers as it can generate better results faster. By actually building an idea (with materials, rather than with only our minds), we quickly learn its limitations and see the many possible directions we can take it. Thus prototyping shouldn’t come at the end of the process but at the beginning! The earlier you start prototyping, the more rudimentary your prototypes will be. But consider that a ball from a roll-on deodorant and a plastic butter dish was all it took to prototype Apple’s first mouse! Once you have a prototype, you should put it out in the real world and observe how people use it. This way, you can quickly discern whether it “works” or how people actually would use it. When T-Mobile started social groups via mobile phones, for example, the company launched two prototypes simultaneously and observed how users interacted with each. Thus the company was able to get a deeper understanding of which solutions customers found more compelling. The reason prototyping is so powerful is because it occupies all three spaces of innovation at once. It is always inspirational, in that using and observing a prototype gives birth to new ideas and potential improvements. Playing with a prototype is a way to test and develop your idea. In other words, it fits solidly in the ideation space. And prototyping demonstrates the viability of an idea, showing that it can actually work and that it belongs in the marketplace, discoveries that live in the implementation space. Our love of storytelling starts at an early age, and stories are at least partly responsible for how we understand ideas and concepts. Thus it should be no surprise that storytelling too plays an important role in design thinking. Design thinkers use stories to make a product more relatable to customers. To develop a good story, a design thinker must consider how a product came into being and how a customer will use it over time. Importantly, the storyline must involve the customer at every step, reaching as far back as the very beginning of the product’s life. For outdoor wear company Icebreaker, this meant attaching a code to each of its garments, with which a customer could track, for example, the wool in a jacket to its source in New Zealand, even to the exact farm where the Merino sheep are cared for. The ways in which a customer uses a product over its lifespan should also be considered when developing a story. To sell a project that was essentially a predecessor of a modern GPS system, IDEO designers told a story about a sailor navigating from one port to the next. Each “chapter” in the story described another important problem the sailor encountered along his journey, and each solution was a feature that was to be developed for the system. But the most meaningful stories are those which customers can write themselves. By engaging customers as active participants in a product’s story, they will be more inclined to use the product or service. The American Red Cross used this to its advantage when it invited people to share stories and motivations for donating blood – a mother’s life was saved thanks to a blood transfusion, for example – thus reinforcing the goal of getting donors to return. These stories remind donors of the good that they do, and motivate new donors to contribute as well to this \"common commitment.\" Google has pink flamingos and inflatable dinosaurs. Pixar has beach huts. Start-ups all over the world have “chill-out” lounges and ping-pong tables. Such perks are the marks of creative company cultures. However, you don’t necessarily need a beach hut or a comfy sofa to create an environment that fosters innovation. Innovation happens when an organization supports experimentation and accepts failure as a part of life. When people are afraid to try new things, no breakthroughs will happen. People won’t dare to develop or test ideas for fear of the consequences of failure. New ideas require an environment where failure – and thus learning – is an acceptable step on the road to innovation. Innovation too requires the right kind of team. Specifically, collaboration in diverse, interdisciplinary smart teams helps to unlock an organization's creative powers. Any project requires input from as many people as possible, including designers, engineers, marketing managers and so on. Bringing all these people together at the beginning as part of your smart team allows you to capitalize on interdisciplinary thinking. Indeed, designers will offer different ideas, perspectives and insights than accountants or software engineers will, but their ideas are no less viable or relevant. It’s important to incorporate these ideas as soon as possible for the sake of expedience. Smart teams will need space to work, and companies should provide a designated space for doing so. The internet as well offers tons of possibilities for teams to work together and innovate. One such online platform is Innocentive, where any research & development team can post a challenge, to which thousands of scientists, designers and engineers can contribute solutions. In a physical office, however, companies should simply designate a physical space in which people from different departments can come together – away from their own private desks – to get the creative juices flowing. Much to the chagrin of parents, children always ask, “Why?” even about the simplest things. Discovering and trying to understand the world from their own developing perspective, children are always looking for insight that will help make sense of what they’re seeing and experiencing. Similarly, a good design thinker always asks, “Why?” Such questioning allows us the opportunity to reframe a problem, understand its constraints and use the information to find a more innovative solution. Instead of accepting the world “as it is” because “it has always been thus,” we should ask whether a current solution to a problem is the optimal one, or indeed whether we’re even addressing the right problem in the first place. Before organized agriculture, humans gathered fruits and vegetables from near and far. This exhausting, sometimes fruitless task was simply the way things were done for thousands of years. Eventually somebody asked: Why do we spend so much time wandering around for food when we know that plants grow from and also produce seeds? By asking this simple question and using it as a springboard for innovation, agriculture, and thus civilization, were born. But good design thinkers aren’t satisfied with just having discovered a solution to a problem. Rather, they want to share their ideas in the hopes that the ideas will be built upon by other innovators. It’s easy to get possessive about ideas. After all, we’ve put so much time and energy into them that we start to see them as parts of ourselves. Thus we try to monopolize the development of our ideas and bar others from tinkering with them. But this is terrible for innovation! If an idea is shared freely, it will quickly improve – and that’s a situation in which everybody wins. As the evidence for human-made global climate change continues to mount, companies and designers need to consider what they can do to help preserve a livable climate for all. Design thinking has the potential to increase public awareness and inspire everyone to engage in a more sustainable lifestyle by effectively informing people about environmental issues. This is not because people are intrinsically interested in environmental sustainability, however. Rather, companies need to find ways to inspire sustainable habits based on behaviors that people already exhibit or that are easily introduced. For example, after design thinkers realized that shoppers valued style and comfort over basic energy efficiency when it came to purchasing products, the U.S. Department of Energy decided to shift its focus when promoting products to encourage Americans to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Thus designers explored the creation of stylish yet nonetheless energy-efficient products and catchy informational tools to better attract consumers’ attention when shopping. Design thinkers also understand that to communicate the urgency of climate change, facts alone are not enough. Thus, designers need to start thinking about how to make sustainability more accessible. One practical way for design thinkers to find a solution is to use a deck of cards, called “Drivers of Change.” The deck is composed of cards with answers to questions like, “Can we afford a low-carbon future?” The cards get a message across with simple facts and images. In fact, the deck has been used by discussion groups to inspire developments in sustainability initiatives. Design thinkers should look at the entire production process, examining products from the extraction of raw materials to disposal. In doing so, it’s hard not to find opportunities for environmentally friendly innovation! A good example of this kind of design thinking is Pangea Organics, a company that produces natural body-care products. Its products employ compostable packaging that contains wildflower seeds; thus you can soak the packaging with water and toss it in your backyard, where it would grow! The key message in this book: Producing the kinds of innovations that change the world requires starting with the right design philosophy – one that emphasizes fluidity, brings people together and keeps its focus on the real-word applications and implications of an idea. Actionable advice: Make it a rule to ask “Why?” once a day.   By being intentional about second-guessing everything, from “Why is the sky blue?” to the foundational beliefs that inform your life’s perspective, you can learn to become more flexible in your problem solving and might even find some inspiration for products and services along the way. Suggested further reading: The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman This book explores the cognitive psychology of good design and what makes a product that responds to users’ needs.

In your personal life, do you take responsibility for your actions, communicate constructively and importantly, live according to your own values? Now ask yourself whether you do business consciously. Do you negotiate contracts with your values in mind? Do you communicate as constructively with your employees as you do with your children?  It’s clear that in today’s fast-paced business world, doing business consciously is the key to success – yet how do you turn your company into a conscious business? These blinks will help guide you toward creating a business based on values that work.  In these blinks, you’ll learn why balancing the it, the we and the I is good for business; how to resolve conflicts through constructive negotiations; and how to answer the question: am I a player or a victim? In Good to Great, author Jim Collins shows how the most successful companies are the ones that strive for more than financial success, as they’re motivated by higher values.  But how is it exactly that values could create a successful company? Many successful businesses are powered by conscious employees. They take responsibility for their actions and know how to communicate constructively, without compromising their core values.  Unconscious employees, on the other hand, tend to undermine a business as they often blame others for problems and see themselves as the victim. They aren’t self-aware, and thus are not able to act according to higher values.  This is why managers should make it a priority to hire conscious employees.  Yet if you want to build a truly conscious business, you can’t stop here. You must also cultivate a balance among the impersonal, the interpersonal and the personal dimensions of your company.  The impersonal is the “it,” things like shareholder value, productivity and other technical considerations inherent to any business.   The interpersonal is the “we,” or the relationships among different people within your company.  And the personal, of course, is the “I,” relating to each individual’s happiness and desire for meaningful work and a mindful life.  Yet instead of creating a harmonious relationship among these three, most managers tend to focus entirely on “it,” the impersonal elements of a business.  When a company neglects its human elements (the interpersonal and the personal), business is a mindless activity, in which failure or success hinges only on managing arbitrary technical matters.  In a conscious business, however, harmony exists among the three core dimensions.  So how do you create a business built on harmony and core values? Read on! When something goes wrong at work, do you blame someone else for what may have been your mistake?  If yes, then it’s high time you start taking responsibility for your actions.  Generally speaking, there are two kinds of people in the workplace: players and victims.  You want to be a player – players build self-esteem from taking action as well as taking responsibility for their actions. A player knows she’s not omnipotent; she realizes that while there are plenty of things outside her control, her goal is to focus only on what she can control.  On the other hand, victims build themselves up by blaming everyone else and deluding themselves into thinking they always act perfectly. You see this a lot in the business world, where CEOs and managers point to external factors for failures, instead of their own shortcomings.  A sales manager, Esteban, has a team of sales executives. He just found out that the human resources department went ahead and scheduled staff vacations without consulting him. Now he’s going to be understaffed in February, the busiest month of the year.  In a huff, Esteban insisted that this issue was HR’s problem, not his own; so he didn’t do anything about it.  Yet since Esteban would be the one suffering the consequences, he was the one with the problem – even if he didn’t create it initially. So instead of playing the victim, he could have taken action to solve the problem himself.  So how do you go from being a victim to being a player? Start by adopting the language players use.  Instead of saying, “It’s hopeless,” say, “I haven’t found a solution yet.” And similarly, instead of being passive and saying, “I have to leave,” say, “I want to leave.” This way, you’ll become more aware of your responsibility regarding what happens around you. Which is exactly what being a player is all about! Children do things just for the fun of it, without thinking too much about goals or what they want to accomplish. This attitude changes once we become adults. Many of us become too focused on outcomes rather than on so-called process attributes.  In one study, when participants were asked to name people they admired, they rarely chose a person who was wealthy, powerful, beautiful or even famous. That is, participants didn’t choose individuals with attributes generally associated with success in Western culture.  But even though these attributes might not matter to us deep down, we still tend to focus on them. And that’s why we sometimes wrongly care more about outcomes than about process.  When an athlete loses a race, he still worked really hard to get to the point of competing – that’s process. We don’t celebrate that effort, but we could. Actually, scratch that: we should!  When you do something you believe in for that reason alone, you get success beyond success. Focusing on outcome won’t allow you to achieve this level of success; you must express your innermost values to do so.  There are always things you just wouldn’t do, right? Thus, your actions aren’t just a means to reach a certain outcome – they also express your values. And that’s how you build integrity, by consistently acting in accordance with your values.  Barry is an automotive plant manager with an assembly team. The team realized that some machines, produced by another factory, didn’t perform as well as they should. When they approached the other factory manager, he wasn’t interested in change. So Barry’s team kept searching for a solution.  From a process perspective, the team had already succeeded. In fact, they had success beyond success: instead of sacrificing their values and making substandard cars, they preserved their integrity and continued to look for ways to improve. Are you often frustrated because your colleagues don’t see things the way you do? While it might be hard to accept, everyone sees the world differently. Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget came up with what is now a classic experiment about perspective. He gave children blocks of wood, with one side painted green, the other red.  Piaget then held a block, with the red side toward him and the green side toward the group of children, and asked them what color they saw.  The children answered “green.” Then he asked what color they thought he saw. The children under five years old said “green,” yet the older children answered “red.” Thus those older children had come to a point in their development in which they could change perspective, seeing the world from another person’s eyes.  Yet just like younger children, we too often forget that perspective is subjective. And this can be a major source of conflict in organizations.  So what’s the solution? The goal is to develop ontological humility, a state in which you are able to recognize other people’s points of view.  Different cultural backgrounds lead to different ways of seeing and acting. But just because someone has a different approach doesn’t make it any less valuable than your own.  If you can’t recognize and respect those differences, it will only lead to conflict and worse, harm.  In fact, a management study conducted by the Wall Street Journal in 1996 showed that cultural differences in operating styles, communication and customer relations were at the very top of the list of problems at most companies.  It’s sad, but true. Many of our conversations aren’t really meaningful dialogues but overlapping monologues. We say one thing when we should say something else; and we really don’t listen to what our partner is saying.  This makes “conversation” extremely unproductive – and collaborative work near impossible.  So how do you improve your conversations for the better?  There are three levels to every conversation. First, there’s the task, or the issue at hand. Then there’s the relationship, or the emotional bond between speakers. And finally, there’s the self, or each speaker’s identity and level of self-esteem. When it comes to conversation in a business context, you might feel threatened on each of these levels, but especially on the level of self.  And when this happens, you might withdraw or behave over-confidently to protect your self-image. Sure, it’s natural, but doing so will hold you back, preventing you from interrogating your own viewpoints and openly exploring other people’s ideas. Plus, this kind of defensiveness is incompatible with good communication. To have productive conversations, you have to establish common ground and say what you really mean.  To that end, productive expression, which is all about finding common ground, is the key to productive communication. For example, if you have a disagreement with an employee, engaging in productive expression would entail both parties describing the problem from their own perspective. That way, you can try to solve the issue in a fashion that feels fair/adequate on both sides.  Another tip is to provide facts. This makes it easier to establish common ground.  Think of the difference between saying, “Our help desk stinks,” compared with, “Last month only 20 percent of calls were picked up within three minutes.” The latter is factual, clear and easy to understand, which makes it a much better starting point for a productive conversation. Do you thrive on conflict? Ugh, who does? But the thing is, when conflict isn’t handled properly, it can have serious consequences.  The most common methods of dealing with conflict in business are, unfortunately, deeply flawed.  Denial is one example of a bad approach. Denial is like closing your eyes when hiking up a mountain, pretending the jagged cliffs don’t exist. It might feel safer than looking, but it’s much riskier.  Many managers tell themselves that employees work well together when in fact, the office is paralyzed with power struggles and sinking in pernicious gossip. Avoidance is another common yet faulty approach. Instead of pretending a problem doesn’t exist, avoidance involves acknowledging the issue but refusing to deal with it.  Many managers here too realize that conflict is slowing down work and creating a toxic atmosphere within teams, but instead of creating a plan to resolve the issues, they simply avoid the problem.  Both of these bad approaches are based on the assumption that any possible solution will either have a winner and a loser or a watered-down compromise that no one will like. (Compromise is often talked about as a good thing, but all it really means is that nobody actually gets what they want.)  The thinking goes that there’s no reason to try and resolve a conflict, since the outcome will surely disappoint someone. But you can resolve conflicts positively if you engage in constructive negotiation.  Constructive negotiation is a way of creating space for new possibilities, by encouraging people to be less competitive and more cooperative. That’s why an atmosphere of mutual learning is so important – without it, constructive negotiation is simply impossible. You can be emotional and rational – these two states are not independent of one another. In fact, our rational mind would break down without guidance from our emotional mind.  Still, as we all know, emotions can mess things up, which is why you need to master your feelings. There are many different skills involved with controlling your emotions. Self-awareness and self-acceptance are particularly important ones. Self-awareness has a slightly circular definition, in that it’s about realizing that you control your level of awareness. So when you say, “I feel afraid,” it’s actually not all of you that’s afraid. There’s also a part of you that’s observing your fear.  And when you learn to become aware of that observational part, you’ll have more control over your emotions. You’ll be able to stand “outside” and observe, without having to act on every single emotional impulse.  And by choosing which emotions to act on, you’ll become a more responsible, reliable person.  Ultimately, self-awareness is about changing your perspective. Instead of looking at the world through your emotions, you examine your emotions independently.  Self-acceptance is about realizing that you don’t have control over what you feel; you can only change how you act.  There’s another competency that’ll help you master your emotions – forgiveness.  Forgiveness doesn’t mean you have to pretend everything’s hunky-dory when it isn’t. It’s also not about adopting a holier than thou attitude.  Rather, forgiveness is simply about letting go of anger and creating space for positive change. The first time the author lost a game of Scrabble to his son, he made an astounding realization: when you love your opponent, it’s impossible to suffer from a competitive loss.  And the author then wondered, what if business was based on such a principle? Generally speaking, concern develops in stages. The first stage is egocentric: at this stage, we’re only concerned with our own well-being.  The second stage is ethnocentric, when an individual sees himself as part of a community. Instead of only caring about their own well-being, people also care about other tribe members.  The third stage is world-centric, when it’s not just about us but about all of us in the world. Research suggests that only about 15 percent of the adult population operates at this level of concern.  Even fewer people have reached the fourth, spirit-centric stage. Such individuals experience a wholeness that transcends all superficial divisions; for them, all competition is cooperation and opposition is just an opportunity for everyone to excel.  Only about half of one percent of the world’s population is truly spirit-centric! At this highest level of consciousness, everything you do becomes a game – and you don’t play to win, you play just to keep playing! This is the real purpose of business.  Of course you’ll still have to make money and accomplish goals, but your ultimate objective should be to develop and express your highest inner nature.  All in all, when you successfully create an organization filled with responsible individuals who have integrity and feel their work is value-aligned, you go beyond “business as usual” to creating a truly conscious business.  The key message in this book: By creating space for personal values in business, you can build a company that is effective, profitable and deeply committed to the well-being and integrity of those around you.

But how often do you ponder why it is that so many people spend upwards of eight hours in an office, each day? The thought probably never entered your head. Don’t fret if how your workplace came to be never crossed your mind. These blinks will enlighten you by exploring how the modern office space developed into its current, cubed form. The cubicle-packed office is a recent concept that evolved over many historical shifts. From clerks crammed into small and dim spaces in the mid-nineteenth century to carefully designed skyscrapers complete with amenities like barber shops, these blinks will guide you through the history of the office. In these blinks, you’ll also find out how a man named Taylor tamed office mayhem; how a bomb caused the segregation between office and factory workers; and how the invention of the cubicle arose from a new concept of movement. You know how receipts and personal documents often pile up on your desk? It takes a lot of work to keep track of all that paper, even when it belongs to just one person. Now, imagine the amount of work it would take to organize documents for multiple employees, or even keep track of every business transaction within an organization! Administrative jobs that deal with filing papers, paying bills and organizing accounts are common, so much so that they’re considered a standard, entry-level position in any firm. Historically, however, it wasn’t until the advent of industrialization in the mid-nineteenth century that such positions became required posts in the workplace. The people assigned to these jobs were called clerks. Initially, clerks worked alongside their bosses in so-called counting houses. These “offices” consisted of nothing more than a dark, tightly packed room. As a clerk, you were lucky if you even had a window! One New York office, for example, housed ten people, six of which were clerks, in an office of 25 square feet – that’s the size of a modest bathroom by today’s standards. By 1855, clerks had become New York’s third-biggest group of workers. The sudden growth in the number of clerks meant people needed more space to work, a development which coincided with a spacial separation between manual and non-manual workers. For instance, you’d often find non-manual workers in a separate office space downtown, apart from a factory where manual workers toiled. Or, if a business was under one roof, the physical separation of clerks and manual workers would be distinct, such as by having separate entrances for each. Another key factor about the workplace in this era was that clerks and bosses usually worked together in close proximity. Consequently, they often developed good relationships with one another, with a clerk often becoming a trusted, “right-hand man” for a boss. This workplace model wouldn’t last long, though. We’ll explore what happened as businesses grew in the next blink. Imagine a clerk writing, copying and filing in his office in 1860. He suddenly travels through time to arrive in the year 1920. What changes would he see in the office? Though our clerk may have taken a leap forward chronologically, we can’t say the same for working conditions. Granted, the workplace did change significantly over those 60 years, as gone are the calm days of working with a single boss and a few coworkers. Now non-manual workers seem to resemble factory workers, with hundreds of clerks clacking away on typewriters, and men with stopwatches recording how long it takes a clerk to perform a task. How did it come to this? From 1860 to 1920, the advance of technology was correlated with the growth of business and office space. In a sense, technology had made the world smaller. Railroads enabled markets to expand across the continent, and the telephone and telegraph enabled the exchange of information at faster speeds and further distances. More and bigger businesses were now possible, and they created a demand for more workers, such as errand boys, typists and messengers. All of these office workers, in turn, needed a place to work, and quickly. Without much thought put into how to scale the workplace for the growth of business, workers were simply stuffed into big office spaces with vast rows of desks. This expansion gave rise to much confusion, however. No one really knew who did what, when and where, as management was still many years away from becoming an established field of knowledge. Thankfully, this changed when the American engineer Frederick Taylor (1856-1915) developed a solution that would be eponymously named Taylorism. Taylorism divided work into segments, with each worker carrying out specialized tasks. Everyone knew what to do, and they knew they needed to do it as fast as possible. Taylorism soon became synonymous with efficiency and mass production. The development of management ideas translated into burgeoning administrative branches in business. So, what happened next? Think about it: When we grow from babies into adults, we grow outwards, but mostly upwards. And that’s what happened to the modern office, too! By the mid-twentieth century, buildings had become so tall they appeared to scrape the sky. Skyscrapers thus heralded a workplace design in which multiple offices were stacked on top of one another. As new managerial ideas flourished in the United States, administrative branches grew subsequently, and eventually, this dynamism formulated itself in the image of the skyscraper – to many, a symbol of both aspiration and success. Chicago and New York, in particular, saw the growth of tall office buildings skyrocket. From 1871 to 1923, approximately 74 million square feet of office space was constructed in New York alone. The workers’ offices inside these buildings were not as grandiose as the building’s facades, however. In fact, offices were normally quite dull, but to make office workers feel special and distinct from the lowly factory worker, a wide range of amenities was offered in these new spaces. The need to distinguish office workers from factory workers emerged as labor movements began to criticize big business and the capitalistic system in general. In Chicago, for instance, an active labor movement gained traction as businesses drove up rents in their acquisition of office space, pushing up the cost of living for working class people such as factory workers. This hostility between labor and capital culminated in 1886 with a bomb explosion in a Chicago skyscraper that was connected to a labor union gathering. As a result, business leaders decided that the behavior of the working class was an obstacle to their goals for new offices and growing enterprises. Thus, to make office workers feel prized and socially distinct from factory workers, many office buildings were designed with amenities such as libraries, dentists, barbershops and so on. This served the purpose of having the workers feel well-off and working together as a new class of people for a grand enterprise. In European offices, American workplace designs had long been dominant. But in the 1940s, as war raged across the continent, cities and the buildings in them were destroyed. As the war wound down, new ideas started to grow about how workers should be organized in office spaces. In post-war Germany, where bombed cities offered a clean slate for urban design and a new thinking, one of the ideas to emerge was a human-based office design called the Bürolandschaft, or “office landscape.” German brothers Wolfgang and Eberhard Schnelle emerged as leaders of innovative office design, founding a space-planning firm called Quickborner. Rather than relying on the hierarchical structures of Taylor’s rows of tables and efficiency-based office design, the Schnelle brothers thought office space should be more organic in its layout. They argued that office space should rely on the flow of human interaction and how different parts – such as communication and paper flow, varying needs of privacy and interaction – were linked. The brothers would measure those factors within an office and design accordingly. This is how they came up with the Bürolandschaft concept. The idea caught on, and soon, major firms in Europe wanted to integrate this concept in their offices. The architectural press began to report on this innovative German idea, and soon organic office designs started popping up in Sweden. The concept even traveled across the Channel to England and across the Atlantic to the United States, where companies were eager to get rid of dingy offices and adopt more open, flexible office spaces. Imagine walking into a big office with an open floor plan, with desks and workers everywhere typing, walking and chatting. How noisy do you think this space would be? Probably pretty noisy, right? To remedy the issue of noise in the workplace, in the 1960s designers tried placing sound screens between desks. This wasn’t entirely successful, however. Why? Well, whether you were given a sound screen depended on your position in the office hierarchy. For instance, executives definitely had a screen; supervisors sometimes had one; but usually secretaries and other general workers didn’t. In terms of function, the screens didn’t work that well. High-pitched sounds or ringing phones could still be clearly heard, for instance, so screens ended up serving merely as a status symbol. Other attempts to improve office space proved similarly well-intentioned, but not totally effective. In the late 1950s, for instance, the US firm Herman Miller Furniture Company hired art professor Robert Propst to help expand its office manufacturing business. Propst held that office work was mental work, which correlated closely with the physical environment. As such, he believed that an office should facilitate health and movement, which resulted in his concept of the Action Office. The Action Office centered on promoting both standing and sitting for workers, while also integrating elements such as movable display surfaces and shiftable, modular walls to provide privacy when necessary. But the Action Office, like many other attempts to improve the workspace, was too expensive – which is how the cubicle was invented. Despite innovative attempts at office design, the demand for cheap solutions was always more pressing. Ultimately, it turned out that companies didn’t care much for progressive ideas such as workspace mobility or employee health. Instead of spending money on carefully designed offices, companies wanted cheap solutions. And that’s how the cheap, small, enclosed cubicle came to be. The key message in this book: The standard office didn’t always look as it does today. Rather, the cubicle is a product of many years of changes, such as technological advances and economic necessity, as well as different beliefs of how workers should be organized in a space.

Realizing your passion is important, because it makes all the decisions that follow easy. Because you always know what you are aiming for, your ultimate goal. For instance, if you know you are passionate about running your own business, and you love the satisfaction and fulfillment it gives you, the decision to turn down an offer to sell it for a large amount of money becomes easier to make. Creating, doing, and making things that you are passionate about is more important than making a lot of money doing things you can’t stand. Before you go any further, you need to decide if you are going to be true to yourself and, “stop chasing the money and start chasing the passion.” One way to find your passion is by trying many things to see what works. Along the way, you might find that one thing through the process of elimination, by realizing what it is you don’t want to do. The more things you eliminate from your list, the easier it becomes to find your real passion. And the closer you get to finding your passion, the less likely it is you will end up chasing the wrong dreams. Rapid growth for your company can be exciting, gaining investment dollars and hiring new employees every week. But beware of hypergrowth and take it as a warning sign. Growing too quickly and hiring the wrong people can diminish your company’s culture. No matter how many positions you think have to be filled, always take the time to carefully consider each new hire. You have to ensure every person on your team shares your vision and wants to be a part of the company culture you’ve created. Conversely, making quick hires can be seriously damaging to company culture if they are out solely for personal gain and career advancement. Make these hiring mistakes, and you are bound to wake up one morning realizing that you no longer enjoy your workplace and the people in it. This is exactly what happened to Tony Hsieh and his first company, LinkExchange, when they began growing so quickly that he realized he didn’t even recognize the people in his own office. Caught up in the rush and excitement of the company’s success, the company culture suffered, because the new hires weren’t passionate about LinkExchange’s mission. They were just looking to make a lot of money and retire. In the end, Tony learned the valuable lesson that it’s best to grow a company slowly to carefully monitor the hiring process and ensure that everyone on board is contributing to the culture you wish to create. Short-term sacrifices to protect company culture and stick to core values are a long-term benefit. The culture of a company is one of its most important characteristics. Your culture is your brand, your employees are your brand ambassadors. So make it a point that each new hire joins the team for more than the skills and experience listed on their CV. Only hire people you would happily go out for drinks with. Connectedness, and feeling like part of a tribe makes people happy and creates a sense of fulfillment. Both are strong motivators. When a group of people feels connected, like a family, there is a strong sense of obligation to the whole team, to work harder and treat each other better. However, simply feeling connected is not enough. Your team should also have a shared purpose and shared passions. Hire only people who emulate, live, and breathe your core values. If you have a strong company culture, formed by people who have a common goal, your company’s core values will form naturally. Company culture is even more important than customer service, because if the culture is right, great customer service will naturally develop from it. For Tony Hsieh, the process of finding a great culture involved much trial and error, but mainly boiled down to spending time together as a team outside the office. When the entire Zappos team moved to Las Vegas together, it forced them to rely on each other and grow closer. A team doesn’t need to move to a new city to do that, but it helped Tony and the Zappos team hunker down and think about what was collectively important to them, and out of this came their core values.   To build a great company, you have to pursue growth and learning. Continual growth should be a goal for your overall business and for all the people that are part of it. Create a culture that fosters both personal and professional development. Build an office library, offer classes for developing new skills. Employees should feel like their work is part of a greater purpose, and that learning and growth are not only allowed, but appreciated. It benefits your business to constantly present all employees with new challenges and opportunities to grow. They won’t feel stagnant, but can develop and take on more tasks and responsibilities as they grow with you.    The Zappos team has a goal of helping employees unlock their potential by constantly taking on new challenges. The overall business is constantly facing new challenges, so it benefits both them and the company if employees are taking on new responsibilities and developing new skills to tackle whatever issues Zappos faces. They learned that the best expertise someone could bring to the team is an ability to learn, grow, and adapt, and they aim to give employees the freedom to pursue new challenges as they feel ready to take them on. One Zappos employee, inspired by her freedom within the company to propose new ideas and go after more challenging projects when she felt ready, became so confident that she started speaking about Zappos at conferences. And the growth carried over to her personal life as well, inspiring her to pursue more reading and a healthier lifestyle. Essentially, a happier, more fulfilled life!  Having one thing your company aims to be the best at is helpful because it allows you to focus and specialize, and thus become really great at something rather than being merely adequate or good at several things. Tony and the Zappos team decided that customer satisfaction and creating a WOW experience for their customers was the one thing they wanted to become great at. They wanted to focus on extraordinary customer service, and on delivering happiness to people through great service. Since a company’s culture and its customer service are closely tied together, delivering great customer service and making your customers happy is only possible if you start by treating your employees well and making them happy. Happy employees will be passionate about their jobs and make customers happy through great service. Tony Hsieh’s most important piece of advice is to never outsource the one thing you want your company to be best at. From his experience with his former company, eLogistics, he learned that if there’s something you want your business to be a leader in, it must extend throughout the company. It can’t be up to just one department. A radical way that Zappos stuck to their commitment to extraordinary customer service was by moving headquarters to Las Vegas, where they wanted to build their customer support call center. It was their way of making customer support their utmost priority, as an entire team.  Attempting to create buzz around your brand is counterproductive when you could just be putting your effort into doing what you do best. Instead of stressing over how to get media attention, focus on delivering a great customer experience and service. The rest will follow, and your buzz will self generate. The goal of your customer service should be to create positive emotional associations with your brand. Every interaction with your customers is an opportunity to further your brand. Great customer service builds your brand and drives word of mouth advertising. Let loyal customers do your marketing for you. When you’re doing something that naturally creates interesting stories, people will want to get in on the action and talk about it. Word of mouth is a powerful thing. Press will follow. Zappos has developed a following thanks to great customer service interactions over the phone, in particular. Creating a great impression over the phone will not only result in word of mouth advertising from the customer, but will also increase the lifetime value of the customer. Zappos uses the money they would have spent on traditional advertising to pour back into their customer experience instead. That means customer perks like free shipping on every order, a 365-day return policy, unexpected next day shipping for customers, and authentic interactions on the phone when customers call for assistance. Because Zappos goes above and beyond to wow their customers in these ways, buzz has naturally generated around their brand, and they have received a great deal of media attention for it.  Having a vision of a higher purpose means being about something bigger than whatever you are selling. It means having a goal that goes beyond making profits and growing a company. Even though Zappos is a shoe business by technicality, that’s not the real thing they’re selling. There’s a higher purpose–namely, making people happy. By delivering great customer service. WOWing people by going above and beyond their expectations. Whether this means surprising a customer by upgrading their shipping or offering free return shipping, Zappos always has the longer term goal in mind which is about more than bringing in revenue. Having such long term goals, in life, and in business, means asking yourself why you are doing something. And knowing you do what you do for a higher purpose will make you happier. This is where it all comes together. For Tony Hsieh the whole point of building a company based on customer satisfaction, of creating a culture he and his employees believe in–is happiness, both for employees and customers. Company culture and customer service are the keys to a successful business. Ultimately, happiness is what everyone is looking for in life, and a company can be successful by finding ways to make its employees, customers, and partners happy. This is achieved through extraordinary customer service and a company culture that is unique, one that employees believe in. Got feedback? We’d love to hear what you think about our content!

The problem, however, is getting there. Corporate bids to improve the representation of minorities by means of quotas often lead to controversy. Worst of all, new appointees end up feeling like they’ve been hired to make up the numbers rather than because of their talents. So what’s the solution? Well, that’s the question two of Australia’s top entrepreneurs and diversity champions set out to to answer in these blinks. The best place to start, Nicky Howe and Alicia Curtis argue, is to redefine the term itself. What really matters aren’t visible differences between people but their unique perspectives on the world – call it “diversity of thought.” And creating a corporate culture that’s committed to fostering open-ended, inclusive dialogue is something that begins long before applicants’ résumés land in your inbox. The key is to change the way you think and behave in the boardroom. Luckily, there’s a wealth of cognitive tools out there to help you do just that. So read on to learn how to start making your company more diverse! Along the way, you’ll learn why diversity is so important in today’s world; how our biases prevent companies becoming more inclusive; and why “groupthink” is responsible for poor decision-making in the boardroom. What is diversity? Lots of people answer this question by making reference to visible differences such as gender or race. That’s an okay start, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Just think of what makes you unique. Chances are, intangibles like your personality, life experiences and beliefs would rank pretty high, right? Well, that’s pretty much the point: there’s more to people than meets the eye. That’s why the Oxford Handbook of Human Resource Management shifts the focus from obvious markers of difference to the wide variety of qualities of people within organizations. Diversity, in other words, is about recognizing that every person is a rich tapestry woven together from multiple threads. Age, education, abilities, disabilities, culture, experience, ideology, profession and, of course, race and gender – to name just a few factors – all shape who we are. Unfortunately, we often focus on what we can see and ignore the invisible threads. That leads to the common fallacy that people who look alike have the same views. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. And that’s the foundation stone of a broader, and more accurate, understanding of diversity: what really matters is diversity of thought. And why does it matter to companies? Well, equal representation is not only good in its own right, it’s also an essential part of doing business in today’s world. That’s because we live in an age which is increasingly Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous – call it “VUCA” for short. The world is constantly changing. Just think of Asia. By 2050, two thirds of the global middle class and 20 of the largest 50 cities will be Asian – up from only eight cities in 2007. Then there’s digital innovation. Once iconic household names like Kodak and Blockbusters have been eclipsed by upstarts like Uber, Facebook and Airbnb. Globalization has meanwhile created a business environment in which companies have to scout for top talent across borders and organizations, not just across the city. If you want to keep pace with those changes and capitalize on the opportunities they present, your company’s board and management needs to be every bit as diverse as the markets in which they operate. And that’s all about being open, adaptable and flexible – something that’s a whole lot easier if you’re drawing your leaders from the largest possible pool! Diversity pays. That’s the view of the business world’s leading analysts. Take management consultancy McKinsey’s 2014 report Diversity Matters. It shows that highly diverse companies are 35 percent more likely to enjoy above-industry-average returns than their less diverse counterparts. That’s hardly surprising. According to the same report, women and minority groups make the majority of consumer decisions, so it stands to reason that companies which better represent these groups are good at attracting their business. But if it’s such a no-brainer, why aren’t more companies cashing in? In a word, bias. Humans are naturally prone to judging people according to clichés rather than their actual merits. These biases come in a number of different forms. Implicit stereotypes link certain groups with supposedly typical traits: think of the association between men and science or Asians and math, for example. Then there’s in-group favoritism. That’s an age-old human tendency to prefer people who are like us. Finally, there’s outgroup homogeneity, the readiness to believe that other groups are less “complex” than our own. These snap judgments have a huge effect on hiring policies and boardroom behaviors. Ever wondered why so many firms’ boards consist entirely of middle-aged white men, why everyone in leadership positions went to the same school or why meetings are held at times that exclude people with family commitments? Put it down to bias! Bias might be innate, but that doesn’t mean you can’t unlearn it. That’s why today’s most effective leaders take time to identify their false assumptions and adopt corrective strategies to overcome behavior that reproduces narrow group advantages. A great place to start is by taking surveys like the Harvard Implicit Association Test (IAT), an online tool which can help you identify subconscious patterns of association concerning weight, race, gender and age. Simply becoming mindful of these biases provides an opportunity for self-correction, allowing you to ask yourself questions like, “Did I just assume that a male candidate is more ambitious than a female candidate because she has two kids?” But the most effective tactic against bias is to become more aware of the world around you – call it cultural competency. Whether it’s learning a new language, traveling with an open mind or simply going out of your way to have meaningful conversations with people who aren’t like you, you can become a greater champion of diversity by living it out on a day-to-day basis. So we’re prone to favoring people like us and forming small, like-minded groups. In this blink, we’ll take a look at one of the most dangerous effects of this phenomenon – groupthink – and how to overcome it. Groupthink is the tendency of highly cohesive groups to favor consensus and make bad calls when they’re under pressure. The term was coined by psychologist Irving Janis, the author of a 1972 study analyzing US foreign policy fiascos, such as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 and the escalation of the Vietnam war. But it’s not just military strategists that are susceptible to groupthink. Boards are just as likely to overrule valid objections and steamroll ahead with their plans when they need to make a quick decision. The best way of avoiding that trap is to cultivate an open-minded approach to solving problems. How? Well, that’s where psychologist Edward de Bono’s idea of the Six Thinking Hats comes in. It’s essentially a cognitive tool to help facilitate critical thought, collaboration, communication and creativity. Here’s how it works: Imagine six hats, each a different color representing a different style of thought. Each piece of headgear is as easy to don as it is to take off. That’s handy because each member of the board will be trying out each hat in turn. The first is the White Hat, representing a sober, unbiased consideration of the facts. The Red Hat is for emotions: its wearer can discuss their feelings on a matter. The Black Hat stands for pessimism – wearing it provides a chance to discuss the downsides of a decision. Then there’s the Yellow Hat, the optimistic hat that lets you dwell on the pros rather than the cons. The Green Hat meanwhile stands for creativity – when you’re wearing it, you should feel free to try out new ideas without worrying about being judged. Finally, the Blue Hat is to ensure that the all six hats are being used correctly. This exercise works best when you’re posing specific questions for each color. So rational White might ask, “What are the facts?” while Black would want to know, “What are the consequences of failure?” and Red would ask, “How do you feel about it?” By using it in the boardroom, you can make sure that everyone is working hard to look at an issue from every possible angle. Emotions play a huge role in the day-to-day life of boardrooms and the decisions made there. Just think of how often you intuitively sense that something’s up. That’s a physical reaction triggered by the limbic system, the part of the brain that controls emotional reactions. That means simply trying to suppress your feelings won’t work – in fact, your best bet for improving your decision-making is to learn to observe and manage your moods. So how do you do that? Well, let’s start with a definition. A mood is basically a filter that determines the way you see and respond to the world around you. According to life coach Alan Sieler, there are six Basic Moods of Life. These come about as the result of negative or positive responses to what he calls Facticity, Possibility and Uncertainty. Let’s break those down. Facticity refers to things that are beyond your control – your age, say, or who is the current CEO of the company. Acceptance of these facts leads to a mood of peace while opposition leads to resentment. Possibility, on the other hand, is about things you see as changeable, like getting a new puppy or making your board more diverse. Accepting possibility here leads to ambition, opposing it leads to resignation. Finally there’s Uncertainty, which refers to the things you can’t predict, such as organizational change or the weather. Embracing that randomness leads to a mood of wonder, while rejecting it leads to anxiety. That’s pretty abstract, right? Well, let’s put it into context. Imagine you’ve had a run-in with a sharp-tongued colleague and it’s left you in a foul mood. Now, the past can’t be undone. That means you’re confronted with an example of facticity – something you can’t change. The only thing you do have some influence over is your response. If that’s something like, “I can’t believe she talked to me like that,” you’re opposing that reality and likely to become resentful. But what happens if you accept her behavior? It suddenly becomes much easier to say, “Oh well, these things happen,” or “Maybe she was just having a difficult morning.” That doesn’t just shift your mood towards one of peace – it also puts you in a position to get out of your head and reach out to her. Rather than resentfully ruminating, you can ask your colleague if something’s wrong and if you can help! So far, we’ve looked at some personal strategies to become more open to diverse ways of thinking. In this blink, we’ll be shifting our focus to collective boardroom game plans that you can use to help your company commit itself to becoming a champion of diversity. So where do you start? Well, the key is to make sure the entire board is on the same page. That means you’ll need to start a conversation. Diversity, as we’ve learned, has plenty of advantages, but there’s more than one way to get there. If you want to find the policy that’s right for your organization, you’ll need to generate ideas that suit your needs. This is known as a speculative conversation – an attempt to figure out where you are right now and where you want to go. In other words, does the governance of your organization reflect the diversity of the communities and customers which it serves? To answer that, you’ll need the facts and figures at hand. Those are actually easier to come by than you might think. Your own firm’s customer relations management systems should have plenty of hard data on who your customers actually are. Hitting up local government statistics bureaus should take care of the rest. Right, now you’re ready to start talking! This can be a sensitive matter – after all, no one likes being confronted with their own biases – so it’s best to be patient and remember that becoming truly inclusive takes time. Here are a few questions to get the ball rolling: If your company doesn’t reflect the demographic diversity of its customers, how can you reach out to underrepresented groups? Could you, for example, advertise positions in community newspapers? Do you take knowledge of other languages and cultures into account when you make hiring decisions? Do you ask candidates for leadership positions how they feel about working with people from diverse backgrounds? One important thing to remember as you go through this process is that “tokenism” often does more harm than good. As the authors discovered while running a program to encourage young leaders onto boards, nothing undermined the confidence and morale of “diverse” people so much as the feeling that they’d been hired to fill a quota. Diversification strategies work best when companies enable diverse newcomers to make an impact from the get-go by giving them real responsibilities. Doing that not only makes new board members feel welcome – it also allows you to start acting on their unique perspectives, thus enriching your company! The key message in these blinks: Diversity isn’t just desirable in and of itself – it’s also great for business. That’s hardly surprising. We live in an increasingly complex world, so it stands to reason that the companies which best represent their diverse customer bases should prosper. The reason more companies aren’t embracing a more inclusive approach to leadership, however, is simple: human bias. Luckily, the tendency to favor in-groups can be unlearned. By adopting the strategies in these blinks, you can start recognizing harmful stereotypes, allowing you to foster an open and inclusive workplace and build a more diverse boardroom.  Actionable advice: Listen to what your body’s telling your about your mood! We’ve already talked about the importance of moods in shaping your perception of the world, but how do you actually recognize these often subtle emotional states? Well, it’s usually a safe bet that your body is already trying to tell you. So start by observing your body language: tightness in your face, jaw, neck and shoulders, for example, is a tell-tale sign that you’re battling with negative emotions. Once you’ve checked in with your body, ask yourself some follow-up questions: “What am I rejecting in this situation?,” “What am I opposed to?” and, finally, “What is my current mood?” That should help you clarify your feelings and start putting a positive spin on things.

What to read next: The Inclusion Dividend, by Mark Kaplan and Mason Donovan “I’m not sexist, it’s just that the top candidates are all guys.” “I don’t believe in quotas – surely you should pick the best person for the job, whatever the color of their skin?” You’ve probably come across these kinds of arguments against diversity before, but just how well do they stack up against the evidence? Well, that’s exactly the question that Mark Kaplan and Mason Donovan wanted to answer when they looked into the matter.

It’s something every company, athletics club or theater group longs for. But far too often it seems an impossibility. And let’s not kid ourselves, working together with others can sometimes be pretty terrible. There is surely no more fear-inducing phrase in the English language than “team building exercises”. But there’s a reason why they exist. We all know that there’s much to be appreciated in a strong team. When something’s done well, we all benefit. But there’s no need to see the dream team as an elusive thing. There are some simple rules that can be applied to ensure that your team will be at its best. Shane Snow’s a great guide for this. His examples aren’t just dry recollections of company politics. Instead, he draws lessons from across the gamut of human history. It’s a lot of fun and it’s a great way to help those key rules stick in your head. In these blinks, then, we’ll take a closer look at the elements that make up a dream team and give you the ideas, concepts, and encouragement so you can go out and create one of your own. In this pack you’ll learn: which hip hop group you should aspire to be; how the Wright Brothers liked to settle arguments; and some basics of modern art appreciation. In 1974, the FBI was trying its hardest to serve a subpoena to a Mafia boss based out of Newark, New Jersey. In those days, the law was pretty clear: only if the subpoena was given directly and personally to somebody was it necessary for them to obey it and appear in court. So the Mafia boss came up with what he thought was a winning strategy: he surrounded himself with bodyguards. No subpoena-wielding FBI agent was going to get close to him! In the end, it was a young female agent, Chris Jung, who came up with a plan. She’d go undercover to the wedding of the Mafia boss’s daughter. She’d make out that she was one of the wedding guests and deliver the subpoena to the boss herself as he welcomed the guests. She was able to succeed because she was a woman in a male-dominated profession and so managed to achieve her goal without causing undue suspicion at the Mafia wedding. There are two lessons here. Firstly, generally speaking, diversity among team members will increase the chances of finding the right solution. Secondly, as Jung showed in this case, diversity can bring new ways of thinking to teams. Jung demonstrated that agency work didn’t have to be a show of strength and brawn. Disguise, intrigue and clever maneuvering could also reap rewards. These lessons don’t just apply to women in male-dominated teams. Gender and racial diversity within your team will add the kinds of perspectives that foster problem solving. That’s because your lived experiences shape the way you see the world, the way you think and, ultimately, the way you solve problems. A greater range of diverse opinions from different backgrounds will challenge people to re-evaluate entrenched perspectives and prejudices. In 2013, four different US universities invited around 200 people who self-identified as either Democrats or Republicans. They were to participate in a murder mystery scenario. Interestingly, even though the scenario didn’t involve politics at all, when the participants were told they'd be explaining their solution to the murder mystery game to people of opposing party allegiances, they prepared themselves better and worked on stronger arguments. The study showed another benefit of diversity: if a team is more diverse, the decisions that are presented will have been strength-tested for success. Have you ever wondered how it is that couples who argue all the time somehow stay together for years? Well, according to experts at the Gottman Institute, a research center that examines couples' relationships, frequent arguments aren't actually an indicator of long-term problems. What’s much worse is when partners stop talking to one another. Conflict is a sign that people are prepared to find a solution. On the other hand, silence can lead to serious issues if problems are left unresolved. The same is true of companies. Organizational silence can result in problems down the line. Let’s look at an example in the auto industry. In 1998, the Detroit-based Chrysler and the German car manufacturer Daimler, who owned Mercedes-Benz and Maybach, set up a merger of their companies. Three years in, DaimlerChrysler was worth only half of what it had been at the time of the merger. The venture had been a massive failure. Interestingly, the cultural differences between the two businesses didn’t result in DaimlerChrysler becoming an amalgam of the two companies’ best practices. Instead, conflict arose between the quality-oriented former Daimler employees and the utility-oriented Chrysler workers. This phenomenon is known as cognitive friction. Discussion was not encouraged between the two sets of employees, creating an environment in which each kept to their own and the groups rarely interacted. The result was organizational silence. This isn’t to say conflict in and of itself is necessarily a bad thing. Just look at the Wu-Tang Clan, arguably one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. They put their differences to good use. The posse formed in the 1990s and was comprised of musicians of different characters, ages and musical influences. The Wu-Tang Clan capitalized on its internal differences, moving the whole genre forward with groundbreaking lyrics and beats. However, a point will always come when tension and conflict no longer help to stimulate discussion and ideas. The whole thing can dissolve into toxic animosity. The famous aviation pioneers, the Wright brothers, knew the risks of this too well. They had an interesting strategy to avoid full-blown hostilities. They’d actually swap sides during arguments and try to argue each other’s points. That way they could detach, resasses their own natural stubbornness, and argue against the points rather than the person. The Wright brothers’ strategy for achieving harmony worked well for them, but it’s not easily scaled up to groups with more deep-seated animosities. For instance, at the turn of the twentieth century, many of the different communities in Buenos Aires were at loggerheads. Neighborhoods were never going to switch perspectives en masse like the Wright brothers did. But here’s something that did work: soccer! Argentinian national identity was evolving. The country used to see itself as one made up of rugged cowboy-like gauchos. Now it was dominated by pibes, kids who loved playing soccer on the streets. And kicking a ball around was something all kids could do too, regardless of race, religion or social class. This was particularly important to the Jewish community, who were facing particular difficulties in the city at the time. The soccer scene exploded. There were games on the streets and in the stadiums. Buenos Aires itself boasted a huge number of soccer teams. And, critically, when people played together, the animosities between different groups of Argentine society diminished. That might seem odd, but there are good reasons for it. Research shows that playing together makes the individuals see the other participants – irrespective of what side they are on – as part of the ‘in-group’. You feel less threatened by your opponents and actually more empathetic toward them. The brain tends to divide people either into ‘in-groups’ or 'out-groups’. That is, there are people who are similar to you whom you can trust, and there are people toward whom you’re more likely to harbor suspicious feelings. The part of the brain responsible for this division is the amygdala. When it identifies suspicious people, it triggers increased levels of adrenaline, sending alarm signals to other parts of the brain and body. The body’s heart rate and blood pressure will increase when this happens. It only takes something a little out of the ordinary to set off this response, even if it’s just hearing a foreign language or seeing someone acting a little strangely. In fact, it’s this chemical reaction that is the scientific basis for xenophobia. But we don’t have to let our bodies’ chemistry guide us. If people play together – as they did in Argentina – they’ll trust one another more. The result will be that in-groups expand and people will simply get along better. It has become fairly common in business circles to quote the adage, \"Don’t change a winning team.” On the surface it may make a lot of sense, but teams that have achieved success in the past often get stuck in their ways. That’s because whenever a team has been successful before, the tendency is to keep soldiering on in the exact same way. Innovation quickly becomes stagnation. Take the example of a company we’ll call G-Corp. In the 1980s it struck gold. It invented the successful blister cushion. Essentially, it was a bandage that released medication into a blister over a given time period. But, after this initial success, the company’s sales started to decline. Its fresh ideas weren’t nearly as good as the blister cushion. It failed to attract new customers. They were therefore forced to change what had once been a winning team. G-Corp’s executives hired the consultants Sense Worldwide who helped them expand the market for their products. It was a shock to the system, but it was needed. The team was able to move forward. Sense Worldwide began by setting up focus groups to help the executives understand the needs of their customer base. The focus groups were made up of people working in professions that were particularly susceptible to blisters. The executives were then made to draw a circle around the blisters on the feet of the focus group members with a permanent marker and then discuss the members’ needs with them. As a result, G-Corp came up with a new line of plaster-type products. There would be different shapes and thicknesses of plaster for different blisters, according to their severity. One final way to change up a team to enhance success, is to introduce someone into it who challenges the views of the others. In an experiment in 2009, American students were instructed to solve a murder mystery in teams of three. Yes, another murderous study – different to the one we mentioned in blink one! After 20 minutes, they were joined by a fourth member, the devil’s advocate. It was shown that the introduction of this new member doubled a group’s chances of solving the mystery. It wasn’t that the new person brought them the right answer. Rather the group was forced to consider its choice and test its argument against cross-examination. One particularly dismal March, the author headed to the Tretyakov Gallery to look at a groundbreaking painting. But he was left cold when he stood before it. The picture in question was Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square. It was painted at the start of the twentieth century, and it’s quite literally a small square canvas painted black. But the true significance of this painting lies in the story behind it. Prior to Malevich’s Black Square, art tended to portray reality and beauty. Even artists such as Picasso tried to capture a sort of reality, however distorted it can appear at first. Black Square freed art of the need to portray reality and reality alone. Art could become a vehicle for enriched visual communication and cognitive expansion. Art could be free. One of Malevich’s students, El Lissitzky, put these ideas into action. He designed propaganda posters for the Communists in Russia. Interestingly, when he realized the sort of power artists have to influence the masses, it proved too much. Consequently, Lissitzky, along with many other artists, fled for Germany in the 1920s. It was these artists who founded the now famous Bauhaus, an art movement that redefined the role of artistic function within global industry and advertising. This goes to show that it doesn’t really matter whether or not you like an original idea like the Black Square on initial viewing. Good ideas will still go on to have a long-lasting impact and influence. Don’t dismiss a possible solution before it’s fully formed. But there’s the other side of the coin: remember that good can come from bad ideas, even if they’re very unpopular. Take the idea that city planners in freezing Winooski, Vermont came up with in 1979. They wanted to reduce the town’s ever-increasing heating bill by covering the town with a dome through federal funds. Unsurprisingly, this wacky idea started gaining nationwide coverage, and was ridiculed from all sides of the political spectrum. It even earned an intervention from President Jimmy Carter, who gave orders to stop the dome’s construction. But the bad idea actually helped the town in the long run. Thanks to Winooski’s increased media profile, it managed to secure funding for a new hydroelectric plant nearby. Incredibly, it was the second largest funding amount per capita in the history of the US. The town was able to heat itself more economically and it all happened because one bad idea got tongues wagging. When you think about it, the Communist authoritarian Soviet Union was an unusual ally for the capitalist democracies of the West during the Second World War. But when faced with the existential threat of Hitler’s forces, they put aside their differences and put their minds to the task at hand. There’s a broader lesson in this. Superordinate goals unite people from different backgrounds who have quite different ideas. An even more extreme version of this occured in the War of 1812. The British were planning to take back the newly independent USA. They planned to send military vessels up the Mississippi river, but the port city of New Orleans stood in their way. The American general, Andrew Jackson, was struggling to match British troop numbers and so was forced to muster up not only his own trained cavalry, but also African American militia, pirates, volunteers with hatchets and hunting rifles and even prostitutes. Jackson was not a tolerant man and despised his new troops. The feeling was mutual. Nonetheless, they set aside their differences and concentrated on their superordinate goal: to defend the country against the British troops. Incredibly, in 1815, this mob of unlikely comrades beat the British back and saved the country from a full invasion. However, the truce between these groups was not to last. Soon after the battle old animosities resurfaced, as signalled by the State of Louisiana attempting to reclaim pirates’ property. The truth was, though their success had been a great one, the differences between the groups were simply too absolute to be overcome completely. But it’s not impossible to avoid dissolution. Unity can be preserved if a culture of teamwork and mutual respect is nurtured. In 1954, an experiment was conducted at a boys' summer camp. The children were divided into two groups, the Rattlers and the Eagles, and they quickly came to loathe each other. However, they were given a series of challenges that forced them to compromise. They had to deal with a compromised water supply and the breakdown of the camp truck during a lake expedition. After the first challenge, the groups quickly reverted to the norm of hating each other. But as they were given more challenges and collaborated more frequently, they began trusting each other’s intentions. They started to empathize. And so a deeper sense of respect for the other group was cultivated. By the last day of camp, the old animosities had vanished. They sat together in the cafeteria irrespective of what group they were part of and sang merrily together on the bus ride back home. It sounds like a swell summer! In the 1950s and early 1960s, the famed civil rights activist Malcolm X was a controversial figure, to put it bluntly. Not only was he a member of the radical Nation of Islam, but his bad experiences with white people in America in his younger years also led him to a radical conclusion. For him, integration was an impossible goal, and so he advocated that black and white communities should be kept separate. This story encapsulates what years of research have shown. Namely, many of our opinions are the result of our brains interpolating belief based on our previous experiences. But there is a way out, as Malcolm X later discovered. If you're put in a strange environment, you’ll tend to reassess your intellectual standpoint with humility. Research shows that if you immerse yourself in a different culture you will become more receptive to new ideas. As you move out of your comfort zone you'll see the world from a new perspective, one that is dissociated from your individual identity. Thus profound changes of heart become more likely. What made Malcolm X finally change his ideas about separatism was his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1964 and the subsequent time he spent in Africa. All that assisted him in developing a new multicultural perspective. He saw different cultures, where people of different ethnicities lived together in harmony. It convinced him that this was also possible in the US. But ressassment doesn't come from nowhere. You have to be prepared to approach intellectual arguments with humility and recognize any predetermined allegiances or prejudices you might hold. Only then will you be able to value discussion and arguments based on their rational merits alone. Malcolm X therefore exemplifies this intellectual humility in action. He was able to reconsider his entrenched opinions and reassess them. The lesson of intellectual humility holds true for teams as well as for individuals. While it’s self evident that a diversity of opinions in a group will increase the chances that the right solution will be somewhere in the mix, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the right solution will be the one that is settled on. This is where intellectual humility comes in. If people are willing and able to reconsider their opinions, then it’s more likely that a difference of opinions will result in rational debate. And if people are able to debate rationally, then it’s more likely that the right answer will be chosen. So far we’ve seen how intellectual humility, lively discussions, regulated dissent and common goals all help in creating a dream team. But there’s more that can be done. When team members hear colleagues’ life stories, it elicits empathy. Teams therefore improve as members better understand one another. A series of experiments conducted by Paul Zak of Claremont University looked into oxytocin production in participants under certain conditions. Oxytocin is important as it’s the hormone that’s produced when we experience trust or kindness, making us more empathetic toward one another. Zak demonstrated that when people were shown charity advertisements that relayed cancer patients’ stories or abuse suffered by pets at animal shelters, the participants’ bodies produced much more oxytocin than when shown ads that conveyed statistics about cancer patients or animal abuse. They were also more likely to donate money after seeing the story-based ads than the stat-based ads. There's a reason for this. Stories make us relate to one another much better than dry numbers. It's simply much easier to put ourselves empathetically in their shoes. The effect can be scaled up too: people’s stories have been front and center of some of the most important social justice milestones to date. Take the examples of Asian Americans and gay people in America. Attitudes toward these two groups changed significantly over the course of the last century. During the Second World War, Asian Americans were some of the most negatively stereotyped minorities in the country. And after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, over 120,000 Asian Americans were put into prison camps, supposedly because they were all potentially capable of conspiring with a foreign power. Eventually, positive characters in film and on TV helped people relate more to Asian Americans. One such character was Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek. He was eloquent, and so challenged racial stereotypes. It was a similar story with homosexuality. Over 50 percent of Americans in the 1950s believed that homosexual activity was criminal and warranted jail time. But when gay people started bravely coming out, and sharing their stories en masse, attitudes began to change. All it can take is a bit of sharing and empathy for things to work out for the better. Dream teams can be difficult to assemble and to maintain. But a good mix of diversity, provocation, intellectual humility and compassion will see you through in the end. It's definitely worth the effort. The key message in these blinks: Many of us have witnessed those moments when, as working as part of a team, everything comes together and something lasting is produced. What’s more, the result can be greater than the work of any one individual. However, most of the time, teamwork is frustrating. We can be left thinking that going it alone was best. But that’s not true! If we’re respectful, empathetic, open-minded, ready to be challenged and willing to listen to dissent, then a true dream team can emerge and achieve the very best results. Actionable advice: Reverse roles. Next time your team is stuck in an argument where neither of the sides is willing to compromise, suggest switching sides. If you’re forced to argue for the idea you were arguing against, you’ll find this will not only ease the tension, but also make everyone see the benefits of both ideas more clearly.

Jobs like coal mining or construction are known to be physically damaging to our health, and regulations have been put in place to limit their adverse effects. But what’s often ignored is the mental health of white-collar workers. Stress from overwork, unemployment or lack of job control has been proven to affect health negatively. From increased chances of heart attacks to higher rates of depression, the modern workplace is putting unneeded stress on millions of Americans. It doesn’t have to be this way. Employers need to institute positive change in the workplace to make sure their employees are living happy, healthy lives. And what’s more, this results in a win-win situation; healthy workers mean increased productivity and higher profits. In these blinks, you’ll discover what the mayor of San Francisco did to lower emergency room admissions; why layoffs are bad for both employees and employers; and how the American healthcare system is different from those of other highly developed nations. Most of us have experienced stress in the workplace. The statistics agree. In fact, studies show that workplace stress is getting increasingly worse and shows no sign of abating. The American Institute of Stress reported that a staggering 80 percent of Americans experience regular stress at work. But if workplace stress is such a widespread phenomenon, then what are the consequences? In short, work can be detrimental to one’s health. For example, according to Fortune magazine, Salesforce is meant to be one of the best companies to work for in the United States. But numerous anecdotal reports from employees show a different side to the company. One unnamed employee who joined the company as a manager was soon compelled to take antidepressants to cope with the stressful work environment. Her constantly changing schedule and demanding job meant she often had to work – or travel for work – on weekends. To cope with all this, she ended up spending around $2,000 a month on therapy and a personal trainer. But not everyone can afford such coping techniques, particularly in the fast-growing gig economy. The gig economy is characterized by precarious short-term contracts and often low wages; some have predicted that 40 percent of the American workforce will be gig economy workers by 2020. The economic uncertainty of such work, combined with little to no paid time off, led to a review of 93 studies concluding that gig-economy work leads to decreased safety on the job, as well as a decline in workers’ overall health. But things don’t have to be this way. An inspiring example of companies trying to do things differently is Aetna. After CEO Mark Bertolini suffered a terrible skiing accident in 2004, he developed an interest in health. This made him rethink his company’s attitude to employee well-being. In 2015, Aetna instituted a minimum hourly wage of $16, leading to a 33 percent pay increase for the company’s lowest earners. This, combined with improved employee health insurance and free meditation classes, led to employees reporting 28 percent less stress and 20 percent better quality of sleep. What’s more, the company’s healthcare costs decreased, showing that caring about employees’ well-being can result in a win-win situation on both sides of the paycheck. Sadly, companies like Aetna are few and far between. As we’ll see in the blinks that follow, workplace stress extracts an enormous toll on people worldwide. Everyone knows that secondhand smoke is unhealthy. Because of this, smoking in public places such as restaurants is increasingly forbidden in the United States. Disturbingly, the author’s research team found that workplace-induced stress is just as deadly as inhaling carcinogenic secondhand smoke. So why aren’t policymakers legislating against this deadly trend? Workplace stress in the United States is actually the fifth-highest cause of death, amounting to 120,000 preventable deaths every year. After careful analysis of data relating to public health and workplace conditions, the author and his research collaborators arrived at this troubling figure. But how does workplace stress contribute to so much suffering? This is partly because in the United States work isn’t just the place where people spend time to earn money, it’s also usually where many get their health insurance. This means that at least 85,000 of these 120,000 deaths are due to a lack of health insurance, whether via unemployment, freelance work or simply a lack of employer-provided coverage. For those in employment, an estimated 28,000 deaths are due to stress from overwork, lack of job control or social support in the workplace. Causes include global competition leading to increased working hours. The growth of mobile technology also means employees are increasingly expected to be “online” and work outside office hours. All of this increased stress affects our physical health, with numerous studies showing the link between stress and disease. In men, for example, stress leads to heightened chances of many types of cancer. Monetarily speaking, the price of stressful workplace practices led to $190 billion in excess mental healthcare costs or about 8 percent of total US healthcare expenditure. At least half of these deaths could be avoided if the United States were to adopt a policy similar to its highly developed European counterparts. In fact, workplace deaths are half as common in Europe as they are in America. Why? Because Europe’s highly developed countries tend to spend more money on healthcare as they get richer, leading to better health and lower levels of deaths caused by one’s environment – including workplaces. So if the United States were to align itself closer to European workplace regulation and healthcare systems, the country would be able to avoid 60,000 deaths – and about $63 billion in healthcare costs. When ArcelorMittal acquired bankrupt Bethlehem Steel in 2008, the new owners decided to shut down its New York plant. This meant the plant’s 260 workers were all laid off. Three weeks later, tragedy struck: a 56-year-old ex-employee, George Kull, had a heart attack and died. His 55-year-old coworker Don Turner suffered the same fate directly after. He’d worked at the plant for decades. Such tragic events are a direct result of layoffs and the economic insecurity and subsequent mental health issues they induce. Countless studies in developed countries show a similar trend backed by strong empirical evidence: layoffs result in people dying. One such study of 13,000 American adults who suffered heart attacks from 1992 to 2010 found that nearly 70 percent of cases occurred after job loss. What’s more, those who’d suffered more than four job losses in the period had a 63 percent higher chance of having a heart attack than those who had not. The same trend can even be found in other highly developed nations. For example, a Swedish study followed employees laid off by companies that shuttered their doors between 1987 and 1988. They found that in the four years after losing their jobs, suicide rates in the sample doubled. Another Swedish study found that 20 weeks into unemployment, the alcohol consumption of those laid off rose by 400 percent. The tragic irony of all this? Companies themselves also lose out as a result of layoffs. The costs of layoffs are many – severance pay, possible lawsuits, decreased morale of those not laid off, and lessening productivity. Aside from these costs, layoffs don’t even fix the underlying issue facing businesses: it’s not excessive costs that are the problem, but lack of revenue. And layoff announcements often correlate to stock prices dropping; this should hardly be surprising, as layoffs imply companies are very clearly not in the best shape. So what’s the alternative? Well, take the US airspace closure that occurred after 9/11. Practically all major airlines began laying off employees – 80,000 in total – to counter the lost revenue. But one airline stood out: Southwest. Instead of laying off employees, they gave out refunds to all customers who wanted them and even kept a promise to pay out $179 million into a workers’ profit-sharing plan. At the end of 2001, Southwest was in great shape. Not only did it have a profitable year, but by 2002, its market capitalization was also larger than the rest of the industry put together! All highly developed nations have enshrined healthcare as a fundamental human right that should not be left to competitive markets. That is, all highly developed nations except the United States. Tragically, an estimated 50,000 people die yearly in the United States because they do not have access to – or cannot afford – healthcare. Just take women suffering from breast cancer, for example. A study showed that when uninsured, their chances of not surviving the disease jump by a hefty 49 percent. And a long-term study of 9,000 Americans of all ages between 1988 and 2000 showed that anyone uninsured has a 40 percent higher risk of dying. Casino workers in Atlantic City are another example group. Since 2011, the city has shed half of its casino jobs. Worse, many of the remaining jobs have had their associated healthcare canceled or reduced, with employers citing financial problems. A survey commissioned by an Atlantic City casino workers’ union found that 72 percent of its workers were having trouble paying their bills due to high health-insurance costs, and half had developed symptoms of depression. Sadly, decreasing employee-provided healthcare coverage is a trend that shows no sign of abating. As health insurance gets more and more expensive, more employers cannot afford to offer it to their employees. In 2011, 40 percent of employers were not providing insurance to employees, up from 30 percent in 2000. And even when employers do provide coverage, employee contributions went up threefold from 2001 to 2011, from $355 to $921 per year. In such grim circumstances, what can companies do to make sure their workers are healthy while keeping up profitability? After all, it’s not just that healthy employees are more productive. Companies that show they care about their employees also inspire loyalty and engagement, and increase job retention. In the absence of a huge policy shift toward universalized healthcare and away from competitive health insurance markets, companies can provide on-site doctors. This bypasses the need to deal with pricey insurance companies, thereby guaranteeing cheap and efficient coverage for employers and reduced-cost – or even free – coverage for employees. Companies as small as 400 employees have switched to this system and found that it has reduced absenteeism and allowed for earlier prevention of disease. Employee perks are all the rage these days. Whether it’s onsite free alcohol or games rooms, Silicon Valley-inspired perks are increasingly found in modern offices. But such amenities are often superficial and cannot alone resolve the high levels of stress found in the workplace. Real workplace change takes time and effort. An important factor contributing to employee happiness is having control over one’s work life. This was demonstrated in the 1970s when British researchers discovered differences in civil servants’ chances of getting heart disease. They found that higher-ranked civil servants were 50 percent less likely to report chest pain. This correlated directly to the amount of control they were given within their jobs, with higher-ranked civil servants having more choice over what they worked on and how and when they did it. In fact, lacking control in one’s job can lead to people feeling helpless. When, say, a popular manager at a company is fired, and no reason is given, employees feel higher levels of stress as they have no control over the negative situation. Indeed, an Indiana University study found that those in stressful, demanding jobs with low levels of control had a 15.5 percent increased risk of death. But things don’t have to be like this. Take outdoor fashion giant Patagonia, for example. The company employs flat organizational structures that don’t allow space for micromanagement. When the weather is good outside, employees are encouraged to take hours off work to enjoy outdoor sports. Such a workplace philosophy allows them to work when and how they want. Social support in the workplace is as important in guaranteeing employee health. Research has consistently shown that having a strong social support network of close friends is good for one’s health. But how can workplaces contribute to such sentiments? First, companies should avoid ranked performance reviews of their employees. These force employees to compete with one another, increasing infighting and decreasing collaboration. Secondly, invest in long-term relationships with employees. Google did so in 2011 when they announced a radical life-insurance scheme for employees and their families. Upon the passing of an employee, the family would receive all the employee’s unvested stock and half of their salary for ten years. Such actions inspire a sense of community in the workplace, relieve employees of stress and increase psychological health. As has been shown, there are plenty of obvious reasons why companies should treat their employees like family. Healthy employees are more productive, more loyal and live longer lives. But what can we do to change the current situation where profits are prioritized over employees’ happiness? Firstly, start measuring employee happiness. This can be done via employees self-reporting their health. Simply pose a straightforward question regularly to employees: “How good is your health in general?” A Finnish study of 2,800 respondents found that when they self-reported their health for one year, it correlated to visits to their doctor. By encouraging self-reporting, companies can therefore best keep track of just when employees are unwell. Knowing when employees are feeling sick or down can help businesses adjust workplace conditions accordingly. Secondly, toxic companies need to be publicly called out. In the same way that companies that treat the environment badly are increasingly called out as polluters, so should the social pollution of an unhealthy workplace be made public. By being called out, companies would be incentivized to make their workplaces healthier. No company wants to be branded as bad for human health. Finally, companies should be forced to pay the health costs for which they are responsible. Take Walmart, for example. The company’s low wages and patchy health insurance take their toll on their employees’ well-being. Their policy also forces employees to rely on public healthcare, the cost of which Walmart doesn’t have to bear. One study estimated that Walmart employees had public health expenditure amounting to $455 million yearly. To alleviate this shifting of expenses to the taxpayer, companies should be forced to pay out a minimum proportion of employee healthcare costs. San Francisco did just that in 2007, legislating that employers had to contribute $1.37 per hour per employee for healthcare. The result? Emergency room costs were hugely reduced, as employees were able to better prevent sickness in primary care rather than at the last minute. At the end of the day, employers and policymakers must realize that there is a moral issue at stake. A hundred and twenty thousand people per year are literally dying for a paycheck so that companies can make more money. And if people are dying because of work, they are being robbed of their dignity. This needs to change. The key message in these blinks: Around 120,000 Americans are dying every year because of job stress. The US health insurance system places an unfair burden of health costs onto employees rather than employers, causing many Americans to be uninsured, pay huge medical bills or even die. The same goes for layoffs, which lead to a myriad of health problems. But by giving employees more control over their work, together with increased social support, a healthier workplace environment can be fostered. Combine that with shifting medical costs onto employers rather than employees, and we can hopefully reduce the number of work-related deaths in years to come. Actionable advice: Accept that there is no trade-off between employee well-being and profitability. These go hand in hand. Healthier employees mean increased productivity and loyalty, in addition to decreased turnover rates. Spending more on healthcare for employees results in lower costs for employers, as healthy employees are less prone to absenteeism and extended stints in the hospital. And, of course, morally speaking, if more companies took better care of their employees, fewer employees would suffer from workplace-related illnesses or even death. Got feedback?

This is a mistake because just as communication with customers keeps them engaged and loyal, the same is true for communication with a company’s employees. Human Resources, or HR, is traditionally focused on contracts, pension schemes, training and recruiting, and less on how to communicate all this work in a way that encourages employees to interact and get the most out of their relationship with their company. So, let’s look at how an effective HR communication campaign works and how to go about creating one. In these blinks, you’ll learn What IMPACT has to do with communicating effectively; why the question “why?” is so important; and why you should learn to KISS. We humans are social beings, and communication plays a significant role in our day-to-day lives. This is precisely why HR communication constitutes such an important part of a business’s success; it is central to how employers interact with their employees. When communicating with employees, you can think of them as the audience at a play: if they’re going to embrace and engage with the play, you’ll need to grab their attention and hold their interest – otherwise, they’ll just fall asleep in their seats. So, if one of your company values is “we have fun at work,” you need to back this up with actions that truly communicate your message. Create fun branding, use slogans and get creative with different ways of establishing a fun-loving communications campaign. This will help employees see that your message and company values are more than just words on paper. Communication is also vital to conveying the serious and complex matters of employment, such as benefit plans, reorganizations, and new HR policies. Since matters like these are often highly technical and confusing, employees usually do nothing more than glance at the paperwork and file it away. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Why not present this information in a way that’s both informative and engaging? How about displaying the information in a magazine format that communicates the details in a clear and accessible way? Effective communication should also engage employees and build trust. After all, when employees trust the people they work for, they’re far more likely to push themselves to get the best possible results. In a London Business School study from 2014, companies that reported high levels of trust regularly outperformed their competition by two to three percent. That same year, a study by the Institute of Leadership and Management found that honest and open communication was key to building trust in the workplace. So, nurture a feeling of trust by providing ways for employees to give feedback and taking their suggestions seriously. You might think that effective communication with employees is easier said than done, so let’s take a closer look at the ways you can get your employees engaged. What effective HR communication does is take the company’s messages and share its meaning with the employees, such that they truly understand and embrace the messages that the company wants and needs to promote. Now, if you simply tell your employees, “We want people to have fun at work,” this will mean different things to different people. This is why the company Merlin Entertainments took impressive steps to promote their message of a fun workplace and make it clear to their employees that they meant it. In 2013, their HR team launched a campaign called “For the Love of Fun” and sent boxes to all of the company’s team leaders. Inside the boxes was a film that detailed the concept of maximizing fun at work. But the box also contained “Fun Goggles,” which took this concept a step further by giving employees a way of literally seeing the world differently and reminding them to always be on the lookout for new ways to have fun. Employees were also given a “fun-o-meter,” which not only allowed them to measure their fun on a scale that went from a chuckle to a belly laugh, but which also, and more importantly, kept them in the right frame of mind. Another key part of any successful HR campaign is to have a clear call-to-action: something you want the employees to do. This could be, for instance, to register online for a new company employee benefit scheme, or, in the case of Merlin Entertainments, to have fun at work. But how do you get your employees to actually take action? The first step is to make the company’s message clear; employees need to understand, accept and commit to it before they’ll act on it. At Merlin Entertainments, to gain commitment from their employees, company leaders promoted the idea of a fun workplace through videos, meetings and by being fun themselves. However, to really connect with your employees and provide them with the right kind of message, you need to understand who they are, which is what we’ll look at in the next blink. When describing how he would use one hour to solve a problem, Albert Einstein said that he would first spend 55 minutes precisely clarifying the question. Once the problem was crystal clear, he would only need five minutes to come up with an answer. Businesses should use a similar approach: first collecting valuable information about their employees to help them communicate more effectively. So, when you’re wondering how you can develop the best HR communication campaign, collecting facts can point you in the right direction. At a previous job, the author was preparing a campaign to introduce a new benefits program. She sent out a questionnaire that asked the company’s employees about how they preferred to receive news about new benefit opportunities. The author suspected that people would want to reduce the number of e-mails they received, but surprisingly, the results were overwhelmingly in favor of e-mail! Clearly, asking beats conjecturing. Collecting useful information is also about knowing how to ask the right questions. One useful technique for getting a lot of information is to ask open-ended questions – the kind that can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” An open-ended question can produce a broader range of insights that may never even have occurred to you. Another useful question to ask is “why?” If you’re speaking to someone directly, you might even ask this question up to five times until you get to the real reason behind an employee’s opinion or motivation. Along with the right questions, you also need to ask the right people. When trying to get a complete and accurate picture of your workforce, make sure to include people from all age groups, genders and positions. Once, the author was asked to conduct a survey and told to only include people from a single branch. But she knew that if the company in question wanted an accurate account, she would need to include people from the company’s regional offices as well. She insisted, and ultimately got the data from other offices. This added information changed the picture considerably, enabling a much better communication campaign. When you’re preparing a new HR communication campaign, constantly ask yourself “why?” when you’re making decisions – this way you can set a clear goal and make sure you stay on target. Every campaign should have a clear goal, so the first “why?” should be: “Why are we launching this new campaign?” The insurance company Liverpool Victoria wanted to start an interactive online campaign that would encourage innovative collaboration among the company’s employees. So the answer to the first “why?” was to get employees to use the platform in order to generate new ideas. With the goal clearly defined, success soon followed: 11 percent of the company’s employees used the online platform every day, with an additional 17 percent logging on every week. As a result, innovative ideas were quickly being developed. When you know exactly what you want to achieve, it’s good to keep asking “why?” as you move forward. This will keep you focused and prevent you from getting sidetracked when challenges or obstacles appear. For example, let’s say your company has a manufacturing site and wants to introduce a new system to help promote employee recognition and to encourage coworkers to talk to each other about recognition. With this in mind, you decide to set up a local intranet site for employees to use. However, it soon becomes clear that your employees aren’t using the intranet because they don’t have access to it during the workday and aren’t clear on how to use the site. So new suggestions are made to develop a form that people can fill out and use to submit recognition to the HR department. But if here you were to pause and ask “why?”, you’d see that this method of one-way communication wouldn’t help reach your goal of getting coworkers to communicate with each other about recognition. Instead, you could set up kiosks where employees could use the intranet during the day, do hands-on training classes on how to use the site and finally remind employees that they have access to the site 24/7 from their home computer. All of these work together to deliver a system and process that achieves your objectives. As Walt Disney once said, “You can design, create and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.” The same is true for your HR communication, because if you don’t select the right communication vehicles, or media, you’ll never be able to entice your employees to focus on your message, let alone do anything with it. The good news is that nowadays there are many media to choose from. Gone are the days when the most exciting thing you could do was design a fancy poster or send out an email. Now you have options like the company intranet, social media, webinars and text messages. The bad news, and the flip side, is that with all this choice, how do you decide which one is right? Let’s say the results of a questionnaire show that employees are unhappy with how complex the company’s new retirement program is, so aren’t engaging with it. Clearly, the booklet you worked long and hard on isn’t working, so you need to find a new medium to take its place. A solution one company used was to add a visual storytelling portion to the company’s website, which explained the employees’ retirement options. It used a combination of images and graphic design to simplify complex details and make it easier for employees to find the program that best suited their needs. Thanks to these changes, employees were led through a series of choices that featured intuitive images and phrases that they could click on to get additional information. This was a huge improvement over the indecipherable terminology that employees had to read through before. Visual storytelling is just one possible choice of medium, of course. The HR team at the company Reward Gateway decided to use a medium similar to a social media platform in an effort to get their young employees interested in their voluntary benefits program. The feature was added to the company’s website, and it allowed employees to post comments about their experiences with the range of insurance products and investment opportunities. And it worked. The platform got more people talking, and since it was fellow employees who were engaging in conversations, it helped people better understand what the different benefit packages had to offer. It was a great way to both spread word-of-mouth interest in the programs and clear up any confusion. In the next blink, let’s look at how you can plan and coordinate your next campaign. Even if you think your communication is so great that it couldn’t possibly fail, it very well might if you don’t put a proper plan together. A good plan will make sure you don’t miss those small but important details. During one communication campaign, the author and her team spent days working on a video explaining the different benefit plans that the company was offering. But after they sent them out to all the different locations, they discovered that the company computers didn’t have the right software to play them. So when the employees tried to watch the videos, they could only see the images without any audio. This is the kind of embarrassing problem a good project plan will help you avoid. So, to help you create a strong, coordinated and collaborative approach, use the RACI model. This will help you determine who is Responsible for a task, who is Accountable, who should be Consulted and who is Informed. Let’s say you want to develop a video campaign to promote new benefit plans. First of all, you’ll need a script written by someone who knows all the details of these packages, so the benefits specialist should be responsible for this task. When you assign the benefits specialist to the task, you might also tell her to consult the marketing team with any questions she has about how to best frame the message. She should also inform the rest of the HR team when the campaign is ready. Meanwhile, as the project leader, you’re accountable for the project’s completion. Everyone working on the project should know their role and be held accountable for it. This ensures the team works together efficiently, meeting both individual and overall team objectives. One of the most celebrated teams in sports history is the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team, a team of amateur players that managed to defeat the four-time gold medal-winning Russian team. The secret of the US team’s success was that they had a diverse lineup of players who added their own different and unique skills. And this is exactly what you should look for when you put together a team of allies for your next communications project. Think of your allies as the people you need to surround yourself with to make you win when it comes to achieving your communication objectives. Going back to the hockey team, it’s not just the players that make them a success, it’s the coach, the personal trainers, the marketing team, and so on. They each have an important role to play, and without them, the team wouldn’t work. Speaking of roles, not all allies have the same role. They’re needed for different reasons and can help you in different ways. Some are what you’d call endorsers: people out there supporting you and the campaign, giving it credibility. Some are partners, who work closely with you to develop and deliver the communication. And some are contributors, whom you go to at key points throughout the campaign to get input and steering. It’s important to find the right people to fill these roles, or it could hurt your campaign. The author had an experience where the wrong person came on as an endorser: instead of talking about the benefits of the new HR program, this person was actually talking it down, encouraging employees at their site not to participate. Don’t make this mistake. Ensure that your allies are truly on your side, helping you create and deliver a successful communication campaign. To reach your employees and truly connect with them, you should invest a lot of time and effort into the content you create for your HR projects, ensuring that it’s valuable, relevant and “sticky.” A good mindset is to think of employees as the customers you’re trying to win over with your HR “products” and to see yourself as the marketing expert who’s pitching the product. For example, Liverpool Victoria Insurance launched a campaign to empower their employees and get them to generate innovative new ideas for the company. They chose an online platform to help get the employees talking; to facilitate this process of empowerment, it was designed with a superhero theme. This theme extended to the launch party as well, where people were encouraged to dress up as superheroes, and all the brochures and materials handed out also looked like comic books. This wasn’t just fun for the employees, it also made the content accessible, engaging and “sticky.” Another crucial guideline for your content is to always keep your message simple and straightforward. In fact, many communication experts emphasize this, including Dr. John Kotter from Harvard Business School. So, when you’re thinking about how to deliver your message, remember the acronym KISS: Keep It Short and Simple. One easy way to keep things short and simple is to avoid repetition – so be sure to go through your project copy and delete any redundancies. And while you’re going over your sentences, take the time to question each one and ask yourself, “Is this absolutely necessary for getting my message across?” If it can be cut without the overall document losing any value or emphasis, get rid of it. Each sentence should serve a purpose by supporting the primary point in a succinct way. You can also make your message more powerful by using an active voice and favoring strong descriptive words like “important,” “amazing” and “brilliant.” People today are constantly bombarded with information from a variety of sources, so don’t assume your audience will take the time to read more than the first few sentences of the message you’re hoping to deliver. With this in mind, it’s always important to prioritize and highlight the essential parts of your message. This can be tricky since the subjects that HR deals with are often full of complex details, but it’s your job to be highly strategic and identify captivating details that will best highlight the value of what you’re promoting. In the author’s experience with HR communication campaigns, people generally won’t read very long messages to end. This means it’s crucial to prioritize what you want to convey. The author proposes using a pyramid structure, where your message starts with a short sentence containing the most important piece of information you wish to convey; the one that every single employee should know. Next, you give the second most important piece of information and then the third in similar succinct sentences. Only after you’ve briefly presented all three points should you go into their details with longer explanations. This ensures that even if employees only read the first three sentences, they will still have seen all of the essential points regarding the program or benefits package you’re trying to get them interested in. Another way to maximize impact is to personalize your communication. Personalized communication is a trend in both marketing and HR communication campaigns, as it makes customers and employees feel like they are being personally catered to. And it requires more than just adding an employee’s name at the start of an e-mail. Let’s say you’re promoting a new retirement program; you could send out an e-mail with custom graphics showing precisely how much the recipient in question would benefit by joining the program sooner rather than later, accounting for the recipient’s age and the number of years left till retirement. When it comes to HR communication campaigns, there’s no autopilot that would allow you to sit back after launch. Instead, you have to remain on top of things to adjust as needed. A good method for this is to conduct regular tests along the way that are designed to show how you’re meeting your goals. Let’s say your current campaign was launched to ensure more employees would understand, and take part in, a particular recognition program. There are simple methods to test and determine whether your efforts are making this happen. One way is to send out employee feedback forms that ask specific questions about whether or not employees know about the program and how to use the recognition tools. If the results show that employees are still unclear on what is available to them, then you know you need to make changes. To determine what kind of changes you need, you might use employee questionnaires. One example of a good question might be, “How would you prefer to be informed about new programs? E-mail or brochures?” But even if the results come back in favor of one particular format, you still need to test the result to make sure your methods are working. If employees respond with a preference for e-mails, but the campaign is still struggling, the e-mails might still need to be personalized or be made more interactive. When it comes to what tools to use, traditional online and paper surveys work well for obtaining quantitative data. But to help you make creative decisions with qualitative data, focus groups are a tried and tested method that can steer you toward the best choices of content, themes and media. All you need to do is find a small group of employees and provide the right questions for the moderator to ask them. These questions should be designed to get the group talking, so they can express their likes and dislikes. Then, you can listen carefully, take notes and start devising a way to better appeal to their preferences. Also, another increasingly popular method is to use social media platforms to test ideas and the potential popularity of campaigns. As we wrap up this book-in-blinks, let’s review all the tools we’ve covered that will allow you to communicate more effectively with employees. To help you remember each tool, just think of the acronym IMPACT: Investigation, Medium, Planning, Allies, Content and Testing. The first stage of the IMPACT model is conducting an investigation into what the best ways to communicate with your employees are and what the objectives of your overall communications campaign should be. Next, choose the medium or media that best suits both your message and your audience. You can then start planning your campaign carefully with a clear timeline and building a strong team of allies with diverse skills and different roles. Now, you can develop your content in a way that’s clearly relevant and valuable to employees. Finally, don’t forget to test the results and make changes, if and when needed. Using this model and the other methods described in these blinks, you’ll have everything it takes to deliver a winning HR campaign. To conclude these blinks, let’s look at a case study of how British Telecommunications (BT) informed their employees about SaveShare, a new investment opportunity to buy BT company shares at a low price. When the HR team investigated the program, they saw that it was complex and needed to be simplified for the employees to understand more easily. As the medium, they chose an interactive online model, along with personalized e-mails and instruction pages. They also created a unique and attractive orange design as the theme of their campaign. When employees went to the website, the interactive features showed them exactly how different investment packages would benefit their savings. And to help provide answers to their questions, BT also created Question Time, an online talk show featuring experts who answered any questions the employees wanted to submit. The campaign was a huge success, with over 90 percent of employees joining the program over the course of its five-year enrollment period. Remarkably, when a consecutive plan began accepting enrollments in 2014, an additional nine percent signed on. This campaign is a great example of what happens when effective HR communication clearly outlines the benefits of a program: everyone wins. The key message in this book: HR communication is crucial to keeping employees engaged and active within a company. It ensures that employees understand and make the most of the company’s HR programs, which, in turn, can help create a more stimulating and productive workplace. Actionable advice: Add a bit of magic Sometimes the best way to make your communication effective is to add a bit of magic, or what the author calls your “secret ingredient” or “secret sauce.” This is something that delivers a memorable experience that your employees will engage with and never forget. Maybe a magic mirror where messages appear when employees walk by? Or LED lights embedded in a boring poster to make people stop and take notice? Find the magic, and employees will love it.

Perhaps that seems like an odd matchup, but, in fact, these things are intricately connected – at least, they are if you want to be a successful project manager. But do you know how to combine these things? Well, this is exactly what these blinks seek to teach you. Read on, and enhance your abilities as a project manager by learning all about concepts related to emotional intelligence, including self- and social awareness as well as self- and relationship management. In these blinks, you’ll discover why emotional intelligence is especially important for project managers; the wisdom of setting emotional boundaries; and how to build strong relationships with your stakeholders. Have you ever felt like your workplace was stifling your emotions? If so, you certainly aren’t alone. A lot of project managers deliberately try to create an emotion-free work environment. That, however, is a big mistake. Positive emotions (and even some negative ones!) can actually help in the workplace. A bit of emotional intelligence can help lead a project to success. Emotional intelligence, a term popularized by Daniel Goleman’s 1995 best seller, Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, refers to our ability not only to identify emotions in ourselves and others, but to use those emotions to guide our behavior. For project managers, emotional intelligence should be geared toward improving work performance. Emotional intelligence is very powerful. In fact, one study of the relationship between IQ, emotional intelligence and project managers found that a manager’s emotional intelligence often correlated with a project’s success, whereas there was no correlation between success and IQ. And emotional intelligence isn’t only critical for managing your project – it gives you a competitive advantage as a manager, too! Emotional intelligence allows project managers to develop positive relationships with their team members and stakeholders, and it can give them the edge on competition, too. If you’re good at working with people, you’ll set yourself apart from other managers, and therefore get better projects and more chances to use and develop your emotional skills And the competition is rising! Every year, more and more people try to get their PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate. In 1995, only 4,410 people took the test; in 2011, 500,000 took it! In this increasingly competitive work environment, you need to make yourself stand out in any way you can. Emotional intelligence can do a lot in this regard. Self-awareness is the base of emotional intelligence. It refers to your ability to recognize your own emotions and the effect they have on those around you. And it comprises three components: emotional self-awareness, self-assessment and self-confidence. Emotional self-awareness is about understanding your own feelings. This is often a challenge. Luckily, you can use the SASHET framework to identify those elusive or frightening emotions. Emotions are always in flux, making them distinctly difficult to pin down and analyze. Moreover, many of us were raised in emotionally unhealthy environments and thus struggle to come to terms with our negative emotions in adulthood. Early on, the author learned to suppress his emotions, which, if expressed, would often set off his alcoholic father. And this early habit carried over into adulthood. That’s why the SASHET framework is useful. SASHET stands for the six families of emotion: Sad, Angry, Scared, Happy, Excited and Tender. Those six families are further subdivided into many other emotions, but it’s a good start if you can identify which family you’re in at any given moment. The next step in achieving self-awareness is to master self-assessment, the ability to pinpoint and explore your own strengths and weaknesses. Self-assessment is also about listening to feedback about yourself and your behavior, and adjusting yourself accordingly. Finally, work on your self-confidence. Self-confidence, which builds off self-assessment, is about being able to maintain your composure, no matter the situation. A person with high self-confidence is centered at all times. When you’re truly self-confident, you essentially understand yourself so well that you’re no longer affected when others doubt you. Naturally, as a project manager, you manage other people all the time. But have you ever thought about managing yourself? Self-management is an integral part of emotional intelligence. It enables you to prevent your emotions from taking charge of your behavior. Emotions can easily take over, largely because the amygdala, the reactive part of your brain, is faster than the neocortex, the part that controls logical thinking. Your brain can push you to react to something before you’ve even been able to consciously think it over! That’s how emotional breakdowns happen. So, avoid a breakdown by pausing to give your neocortex some time to process what’s going on. If you can’t identify and consciously think about your own emotions, they’ll take over. If you’re afraid of failing at something, for example, you might start procrastinating in attempt to avoid the project altogether. But you’ll only end up creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: you’ll definitely fail if you don’t try. Managing such a situation is a matter of managing your own fear. Effective self-management also requires self-control. Self-control is the ability to stay calm, even when your emotions are going wild. It’s certainly difficult at times, but there are some good techniques that will help you stay cool: First off, identify what triggers your biggest emotional reactions – those times when your emotions try to take over. You can’t manage your triggers if you don't know what they are. You can also reduce your stress by avoiding long workweeks. Take care of yourself, both mentally and physically! Finally, make sure you have a healthy network of support. Talk to your friends when you need help managing your emotions and ask them for feedback on your behavior. The next key part of emotional intelligence is building strong relationships with other people, and that requires social awareness. Social awareness is about understanding the emotions of others. It’s made up of four parts: empathy, organizational awareness, seeing others clearly and setting emotional boundaries. Empathy, the first component, refers to your ability to understand how other people feel. You’re able to recognize another person’s emotions – whether positive or negative – and engage accordingly. As a project manager, that means you need to listen to your team members using empathetic listening. Don’t just listen to their words alone; try to figure out what they’re really feeling. You also have to master the ability to see others clearly. That means understanding people and accurately assessing their strengths and weaknesses. It’s more challenging than it seems. Even if you don’t like the person, strive to think objectively; otherwise, you might impose your own bias. Take the time to really look and think. Organizational awareness is closely linked with seeing others clearly. Organizational awareness is the ability to understand the emotional context of your particular company, project team or other organization. What’s the power structure? Which emotions does it generate? The last step is setting emotional boundaries that protect you from the emotions of others. It’s important to relate to other people’s emotions, but you shouldn’t allow them to control you. Altering your language is a good way to help with this. So if you’re angry with someone, for example, say you feel angry, not that they made you angry. Taking responsibility for your feelings is always better than blaming them on someone else. Project managers have to build relationships more often and more quickly than most people do. That’s why relationship management is crucial! Relationship management has two key components: establishing stakeholder relationships and developing others. There are four steps to establishing strong stakeholder relationships: First, identify the project stakeholders, anyone who affects or is affected by the project: the team members, vendors, sponsors and so on. Next, gather as much information as you can about them. What role does each stakeholder play? What are their goals and interests? How do they communicate? After that, develop relationship strategies for them. Figure out what your most effective relationship with them would be and start working toward it. Finally, keep managing the relationship – it’s an ongoing process. Check regularly that things are going well and your relationships are producing the results you want. You might do this by establishing regular meetings to check up on how everyone feels. The second part of relationship management is developing your team members. That means acknowledging and commending their strengths, mentoring them and providing them with useful feedback. Developing others is ultimately a form of investing in the project team. So, first off, acknowledge their strengths: make them aware of their potential and always say “thank you” when they contribute to the project. Next, give them targeted feedback. Targeted feedback is clear, objective and aimed at helping the person improve, not at putting them down. So don’t emphasize someone’s laziness; instead, focus on where they could improve. It’s always better to talk about what could make someone’s performance better, as opposed to what made it bad.   Finally, never stop mentoring and coaching your team members. Offer advice and encouragement whenever you can. Make sure they feel that they can always talk to you and that you’ll listen to what they have to say. The final aspect of emotional intelligence for project managers is team leadership. Team leadership is the ability to lead the project team toward their goals in a healthy and effective way. It’s how you overcome conflicts and keep everyone on track. Communication and conflict management are the two most important skills here. Positive communication allows you to set the right emotional tone in all exchanges. It’s a big part of your job as a project manager, whether you’re communicating with stakeholders, team members, in an interview or over lunch. Project managers have to communicate in a way that creates the right emotional atmosphere and avoids any feelings of negativity. Imagine you’re about to hire new staff, for example, and you’re nervous about conducting the interviews. If you don’t come to terms with your fear, it could cause you to overlook the right candidate or hire one that isn’t right for the position. Instead of succumbing to fear, create a comfortable setting and approach your interviewees with empathy. Look for cues about what they’re feeling and share your own emotions when appropriate. Afterward, be sure to ask them how they felt about the exchange. Emotional intelligence will also help you manage any conflicts that arise. That’s where skills like compromising come in. Compromising means solving the problem by openly discussing it and getting both sides to give up some of their demands. You need to be self-aware and manage your own emotions in order to hold a truly open discussion; if you’re not, your emotions might take over. You also need to listen empathetically and communicate carefully with everyone involved. Compromising requires a lot of emotional intelligence! The key message in this book: Emotional intelligence is important for everyone. But it’s especially important for project managers, as their job rests on human communication and solid connections with others. So work on your self-awareness, manage yourself and your different relationships and listen empathetically to your team and stakeholders. Emotional intelligence doesn’t just make the workplace more pleasant; it gives you a competitive edge and helps you work toward your goals, too! Actionable advice: Have lunch! Take a lunch break with a stakeholder instead of eating a sandwich at the office. You’ll get to know them better and learn more about them in a relaxed setting. It’s a good way to strengthen your relationships with the people who matter most.

Sure, they might claim they do. But do they really? What do they actually do for their employees? It’s likely that their caring is merely lip service. In reality, they probably do very little aside from providing the obligatory suggestion box. As well as annoying their employees, these uncaring businesses are harming themselves. These blinks show you how one businessman transformed and strengthened his company by putting his employees first. By giving them the freedom to innovate and the room to be happy, he made the business a huge success. Read on, and perhaps you can do the same. In these blinks, you’ll learn why employees value actions over promises; what a responsible freedom is; and why the author’s employees loved to ride around in his convertible.  How would you measure the success of a company? Your first instinct might be to simply look to the number of products a company sells and the profits it generates – and, without a doubt, these are important factors. But to be truly successful, a company should always put the well-being of its employees first and foremost.  So how do you create the kind of environment that leads to happy employees? It begins with strong leadership. But don’t think of it as strictly managerial leadership; think of it as stewardship. This means letting your employees know that you’re truly looking out for their best interests. You should move beyond simply acknowledging their productivity and actually take the time to inform them that you value their work. You can do this by putting aside some time each week to talk to your employees face-to-face and express your gratitude for their dedication and the hard work they do.  By doing this you’re not only giving them a sense of security and fulfillment in their job. You are also literally benefitting their health. A recent poll of American workers showed that those who said they love their job spent 62 percent less on healthcare than those who hated their job. This leadership role is similar to good parenting. Being a parent means constantly checking in with the kid, verifying they are healthy and in good spirits. An employer should do the same by regularly asking employees some simple questions: Do they feel secure? Do they feel fulfilled? Is their life meaningful to them? When you consider these questions yourself you will realize the degree to which you’re responsible for your employee’s happiness. After all, it’s not just a business you’re building – it’s also a home, a place that both you and your employees need to feel safe and secure in. A happy employee is someone who trusts company management. One way to foster trust is to craft a company charter: a motivational mission statement for the values and goals of the company. But be careful; a company charter that doesn’t value its employees can leave people feeling unhappy and underappreciated. The first step toward creating an impactful charter is reaching out to your employees. Co-author Bob Chapman, CEO of the manufacturing equipment supplier Barry-Wehmiller, knew the importance of sitting down with his employees when he wrote his company’s charter, “Guiding Principles of Leadership.” He asked everyone for input, using the opportunity both to learn about his employees’ concerns and to acknowledge and honor their opinions. For instance, many employees expressed concern that there might be a lack of trust between the employees and the management. So Chapman decided to prominently advocate creating an environment of trust at the top of the charter. But of course, actions speak louder than words.  Chapman knew that once the charter was in place he would have to back those words up and prove to his employees that he meant what he wrote. An opportunity presented itself when he caught wind of an employee who was annoyed that there were set times for bathroom and coffee breaks. The very next day, Barry-Wehmiller set about dismantling all the company practices that could be viewed as management not trusting employees – such as set break periods and time clocks. Employees understood that the company was listening to them and the experience helped forge a bond of trust between them and management. Have you ever worked for a company that was run by a dictatorial management? When companies rely on oppressive rules, they usually end up with unhappy employees. Edicts from above not only betray that important sense of trust but also hamper creativity, individuality and any motivation to be innovative.  To avoid this outcome, leadership should instead cultivate an environment of responsible freedom, designing the workplace so that employees can reach their full potential. At Barry-Wehmiller, the company fosters this kind of business environment with what they call the “just enough” method. This is a goal-oriented approach to business that gives employees a clear idea of what “winning” is and what they should be working to achieve. For example, a customer-focused company might define winning as scoring the best possible result on a customer satisfaction survey. And once success is clearly defined, employees then have the freedom to achieve that goal using the skills and talents that make each employee special.  Empower your employees by trusting them and allowing them to use their own judgment to achieve goals and carry out tasks. When Barry-Wehmiller adopted the “responsible freedom” approach, a team of employees was allowed to choose a new laser-cutting machine. It might sound like a simple task, but, actually, this was the biggest purchase in the history of this department! The employees ended up embracing this responsibility enthusiastically, even working on weekends to do research and eventually overseeing the installation of the machine. They were so thorough that when a representative came over to teach them about the machine, they already knew more about it than he did! This empowering approach received praise when a group from Harvard Business School toured the company. The story of the laser-cutter proved to be the inspirational highlight of their visit! Another common reason for unhappy employees is working for a company that is going nowhere. To cure this stagnation, and get your company growing and your employees happy, start visioning! Visioning is a way of creating a path toward your company’s future. Think of this process as shining a spotlight on where your company wants to go. To get started, focus on answering these two important questions: Where is my company going? And why is it going there? This second question pertains to the “higher purpose” of your business and the answer should reflect a desire to improve the lives of your employees. This is called cultural visioning. When the consulting company Design Group did their cultural visioning they prioritized maintaining an inclusive work environment over increasing the size of the company. By following this vision the company made sure that their employees would continue to come to work inspired and happy. But cultural visioning is only half of the solution. To maximize your chances of success, you’ve got to add a powerful business vision. Now it’s time to turn your attention to the question of where you want the business to go and how you want it to get there. Design Group eventually realized that without a business vision in place, employees still felt that company momentum was lacking. So the company decided to add a bold business vision and created a goal of doubling the organization’s size within five years. With the announcement of both the inclusive cultural vision and the ambitious business vision, the employees of Design Group felt motivated and happy to be part of a growing and exciting company with a bright future. As it turned out, with their visioning in place, it took the Design Group only three years to double in size! No one likes to see their hard work go unrecognized. A happy employee is one who gets acknowledged by their colleagues for their efforts. Every successful business leader should keep this in mind. Barry-Wehmiller knows the importance of recognizing good work. They’ve created a system for employees to nominate their peers, instead of having management bestow awards. Nominees all receive letters of acknowledgment, praising their good work – even if they don’t end up winning an award. The employees put so much thought and care into writing the nomination letters that award winners have come to appreciate these letters more than the awards themselves. The praise that employees receive from co-workers leads to higher levels of motivation, often inspiring improvement. This kind of personalized award system works much better than handing out money. A monetary incentive might help with aligning a company’s goals with those of an employee’s (for example, through sales-based bonuses), but personal and creative acknowledgements are more meaningful and carry more of an impact than money. Ultimately, the purpose of an award should be to affect the life of the recipient in a way that will be uniquely memorable. When Barry-Wehmiller began their peer-nominated award program, the CEO decided to make one prize the chance to drive one of his luxury convertibles for a week. Talk about establishing trust! Sometimes even family members get in on the action of the award ceremony. One employee was surprised when his family showed up, and explained that the award was made all the more special by the company inviting them to take part. This is why the award program is still in place at Barry-Wehmiller today and why the award ceremony continues to be one of the most important celebrations at the company: it’s not just about the award itself; it’s about how the company can make its employees feel appreciated and proud of the work they’ve done. The key message in this book: Caring for your employees as you’d care for your family will not only transform your business; it will also transform your employees’ lives. By freeing them from oppressive rules and regularly celebrating their achievements, you can empower them to reach their full potential.  Actionable advice: Make sure you honestly and actively listen to your employees. These days, it can be hard to put your own work aside and really give employees 100 percent of your attention. Being present and honestly concerned about what your employees have to say will not only allow you to better understand their thoughts and concerns; it will also contribute to a more open and inclusive atmosphere where all members of your company feel they can express themselves and be heard.

Whether you’re a team leader, manager or a parent raising kids, the answer is deceptively simple: praise. That’s about more than merely complimenting folks, however – if you really want to help those around you fulfill their potential, you need to start speaking to their most cherished values and skills.  And that’s where affirmation comes in. Affirmation is all about creating a supportive structure that encourages people to act on their best instincts. Doing that, organizational psychologist Tim Irwin argues, is a skill much like others – it can be learned.  How? Well, in these blinks we’ll be taking a look at affirmation in practice in a variety of settings. Drawing on the latest neuroscientific research, Irwin explains both the “why” and the “how” of affirmation as well as providing a wealth of actionable tips and tricks to help you become a more effective leader.  Along the way, you’ll find out:  why affirmation is much more effective than a simple compliment,  how to reinforce positive values and get the most out of your team, and  why yelling has long-term consequences for a child’s development.  Losing can be devastating. Take it from the author’s son, the captain of his school’s football team. The athletes he was leading had put a ton of effort into improving their performance but still ended up losing a vital match.  After the game, the opposing team’s coach came up to the author’s son and told him that it’d been an honor playing against him and his team. Despite the loss, he added, they’d played their hearts out and shown tremendous courage. It was just what the boy needed to hear, and it took the sting out of the defeat. After that pep talk, he even felt inspired.  No wonder: the human brain craves affirmation. That’s backed up by hard evidence. Neuroscientific research carried out over the last couple of decades has shown that the brain responds physically to positive emotional feedback.  How? Simply put, it releases neurochemicals which increase our sense of wellbeing. According to a 2005 study by the American psychologists Creswell, Welch and Taylor, affirmation reduces stress and sharpens our problem-solving skills. And that, in turn, boosts our overall performance.  That said, it’s important to remember that affirmation comes in different forms. Social life is full of low-key acts of affirmation. We often compliment someone on their clothes, for example, or tell a coworker that they’ve done a “great job.” These small pats on the back are nice enough, but they’re not the same thing as real affirmation.  The difference becomes apparent when you look at the etymological roots of the term itself. “Affirmation” comes from the Latin noun affirmatio, which is derived from the verb “to strengthen” or “fortify.” True affirmation, then, is deeper than a throwaway compliment. It’s about accompanying someone through a process and offering constant reinforcement through constructive feedback and – when it’s deserved – high praise.  A good example of how that might play out comes from the culinary world. In Japan, sushi apprentices spend years doing menial work before they’re allowed to complete even simple cooking tasks like preparing eggs. When they’ve finally mastered their craft, they receive the honorific title of shokunin or “artisan” from their master.  That’s the final act of support and affirmation bestowed by their teachers, the sushi masters who’ve spent years closely guiding their apprentices through the tricky process of mastering sushi-making.  If you want to compliment someone, it’s helpful to know a little about them – after all, everyone loves being praised for things that matter to them. If you’re crazy about fashion, for example, you’ll be pleased if a colleague tells you they love your new shirt. If you don’t much care about the latest sartorial trends, however, the compliment will fall flat.  The same goes for affirmation. The best way to communicate your support for a team member is to focus on what they really care about – their strengths. Let’s see how that works.  Typically, you’ll find four different personality types in the workplace: the doer, the advocate, the idealist and the challenger. As their name suggests, doers are all about getting things done. That sometimes goes hand-in-hand with a bullish insensitivity to colleagues. If you want to affirm a doer, your best bet is to praise them for doing a great job on a presentation or meeting a tough deadline.  Advocates are people-centered and seek inclusiveness. To support them, you should focus on their role holding the team together and keeping its members’ morale up. Then there are idealists – dreamers who think big and care about integrity. Affirming their work is all about thanking them for reminding everyone of the company’s original values.  Finally, there are challengers, folks who question the status quo and are always on the lookout for new solutions and approaches. If you want to praise them, you should emphasize how valuable you find their novel way of looking at projects.  But affirmation isn’t only about personal strengths – in fact, professional competencies are just as important. So let’s say you’ve called in a team member to congratulate them on hitting your firm’s financial targets. You’ll want to tell them that you appreciate their achievement, of course, but you shouldn’t stop there.  The key here is also to remind them why they did such a great job. To stick with our hypothetical example, that might mean praising the excellent judgment of character that allowed them to put together such a talented and hardworking sales team.  Emphasizing these qualities has two outcomes. First off, it shows that you’re interested in and aware of people’s hard work and achievements rather than just obsessing about company goals. Secondly, that kind of deep affirmation leaves folks feeling truly supported and even more determined going forward.  There’s been a great deal of philosophical debate over the millennia about what defines a person’s core. Some have claimed it’s the mind; others have argued that it’s the heart while others still have suggested it’s the soul. The jury is still out on that question, but here’s something we do know: wherever the core is, it’s where our deepest values reside.  That’s something effective communicators know. When they seek to affirm others, they speak to their most cherished values. But before we take a look at how they do that, let’s pause for a second and ask how such values are formed in the first place.  Essentially, there are two processes at work here: self-reflection and the influence of other people. The latter is especially important as it’s only in social contexts that we find our values being affirmed or contradicted by others.  You can see how that works by taking a fictional workplace incident. Say you’ve resolved a conflict between colleagues in a positive and respectful way. Your boss tells you that you showed a great deal of integrity in handling the issue and that this reflects well on your character. Chances are, you’re going to act in the same way again, right? Well, that’s because your values have been positively reinforced.  But affirming profoundly held values requires thoughtfulness and an ability to pick the right words. In fact, there are a couple of key concepts which are essential to communicating your affirmation of others.  Take courage. Imagine the following scenario. One of your employees is negotiating with the CEO of another company. The latter is keen to push the deal through as quickly as possible, but they’ve made misleading or outright false statements in the paperwork.  Standing up to the CEO takes a huge amount of courage for the employee, and that’s something you should affirm. Simply telling them that they’ve done a great job at the end of the process won’t have the same effect as recognizing their strength of character in dealing with this tricky situation.  Another keyword is humility. If you see someone sharing praise for a successful project with their colleagues rather than hogging the limelight themselves, make sure to affirm that behavior. When the author’s wife Anne was a kid, she took an art class at a local preschool playgroup. There she was told to follow certain rules – houses, for example, should be square, the sun a circle and treetops wavy. But that’s not how Anne wanted to paint. Instead, she splattered colors across her canvas at random.  Anne’s teacher Ms. Caldwell wasn’t pleased and told the whole class to gather around and look at the “mess” this precious would-be Jackson Pollock had made. It was a humiliation Anne remembers to this day.  That’s hardly surprising. Criticism like Ms. Caldwell’s isn’t just painful at the time – it also has a long-lasting effect on the brain. Take a 2011 study by American neuroscientists Etkin and Egner. Criticism, they showed, activates the amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for the flight-or-fight response to life-threatening situations like confronting a lion in the wild.  A 2012 study by Chinese management researchers Liu and Liao also found that criticism impairs proper cognitive functioning. Criticism, they argue, undermines our ability to think abstractly and creatively and engage in self-reflection. That weakens our resourcefulness and self-confidence.  As Anne’s example shows, criticism is especially damaging when it’s public. In 2013, neuroscientists Stallen, Smidts and Sanfey demonstrated that social conformity is linked to parts of the brain responsible for processing emotions. Following our peers’ lead and winning their acceptance triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that gives us a sense of wellbeing.  And that’s why criticism in front of a peer group is so devastating. Not only does it trigger a flight-or-fight response but it’s also associated with the negative feeling of being rejected by our tribe. That, in turn, further undermines our self-belief. The takeaway here? Keep criticism private and make affirmation and praise public! In the following blinks, we’ll look at how to do that in several real-life situations.  Positive leadership and affirmation are crucial in times of crisis. That’s something Eric Pillmore knows all about. In 2002, he was appointed vice president of corporate governance at Tyco International, a security-system manufacturer.  Pillmore had his work cut out for him. The former CEO had siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars out of the company’s accounts, and Tyco looked like it might go bust at any moment. Pillmore’s job: turning things around.  How? Well, here’s where he started: rebuilding trust in individuals. When organizations find themselves in dire straits, individuals usually start scrambling to save their skins. In Tyco’s case, employees were worried that the company’s association with criminal activity would affect their reputations.  Pillmore realized that he had to make Tyco trustworthy again. Together with other senior leaders, he organized a series of meetings in which the firm’s 230,000 employees could voice their concerns and ask managers what was going on. It was a canny move. Workers felt that their superiors were taking them seriously and began to trust the company again.  The meetings continued until everyone’s issues had been addressed. By the end of the process, formerly enraged employees were giving their leaders standing ovations!  Pillmore also realized that while restoring individual trust was a good starting point, it wasn’t enough: he also needed to establish group trust. The crisis had been so severe that workers hadn’t just lost faith in their managers – they’d also started distrusting one another.  Over the following years, more meetings were held. These focused not so much on individual concerns but on establishing transparency and accountability within teams and groups. It was a stunning success. In 2007, Governance Metrics – the company which rates Tyco’s corporate accountability – gave the firm ten points, a perfect score. Not bad when you consider that its rating in 2002 had been just one and a half! Ask the average employee what they think of their annual performance review and the two words you’ll hear most often are “uncomfortable” and “stressful.” Why? Well, two issues stand out. First off, reviews often lead to misunderstandings between workers and their bosses. More importantly, employees end up feeling like their contributions over the last year haven’t been fairly assessed.  Luckily, change is afoot in the corporate world. Take the old-school approach of rating employee performance on a scale from one to nine using abstract and complex metrics. Today, top companies like Microsoft, Dell, Goldman Sachs and New York Life have abandoned the attempt to put a number on their workers’ efforts.  There’s a good reason for that. As FedEx CEO Michael Ducker notes, workplace performance just isn’t measurable in the same way it used to be, especially in the growing service industry. What matters today is discretionary effort – the way employees interact with clients, say, or the time and resources they invest in personal development. None of that can be quantified numerically.  So what’s the alternative? That’s where affirmation-based performance review systems come into the picture. These do away with pseudo-scientific quantification and instead rely on subjectively determined and broad categories like “excellent,” “very good,” “average” and “needs improvement” to define performance. That creates a lot more room for affirmation as it allows bosses to use reviews to highlight key competencies like technical skills or people skills that helped an employee achieve company objectives.  More importantly, it shifts the focus from targets to the question of how work has been carried out. In this new system, an employee who achieves their sales goals but creates a toxic work environment won’t automatically be rewarded with a higher rating than a colleague who falls short of the target but uses his time to help others and encourage the team to grow together.  These kinds of review systems also mean that there’s much greater emphasis on individuals. As we saw in an earlier blink, affirmation encourages positive behavior. Building that into performance reviews makes it much more likely that employees will have key character traits like courage and self-regulation reinforced. Abusive coaching, parenting and teaching are all too common. In some areas of life, like athletics, yelling and harsh criticism are even celebrated as the best way of getting kids to fulfill their potential. But here’s the truth: shouting at children just isn’t very helpful if you want them to go far in life.  So why do people do it? As the social psychologist Barbara Fredrickson points out, folks tend to assume it works because of its short-term effects: when you yell at kids, you get their attention, and they do as you say.  In the long run, however, that strategy inevitably ends up backfiring. That’s because criticism and yelling have a negative impact on children’s loyalty, their ability to bond with authority figures and other members of their group as well as on their performance levels and personal development.  So here’s the alternative: affirmative feedback.  That’s essentially all about relating a child’s behavior to a goal to which they aspire and pointing out the differences between the two. If a child wants to become a doctor, astronaut or engineer, for example, they’ll need to develop specific skills and attitudes to achieve that goal. Pointing out that their current behavior is leading them away from their goal is a much more effective strategy than hollering at them. The same goes for a kid who’s set on applying for a prestigious college but has started coming home with poor grades. Rather than getting mad and working yourself up about your child’s academic results, you could just as easily remind them that they’re undermining their dreams.  Affirmation also works wonders in the classroom. Teachers who avoid shaming and humiliating kids and instead tell them that they believe in their ability and encourage them to put their mind to the task at hand are much more likely to help their pupils achieve their potential.  And that just goes to show how important affirmation is! Whether you’re a parent trying to help your children navigate life or a manager encouraging your employees, speaking to people’s best selves is one of the most powerful tools in your communication toolbox. The key message in these blinks: The scientific consensus is clear: affirmation has a positive effect on the brain. But here’s the flipside: unconstructive criticism, yelling and humiliation are just as capable of altering the brain – for the worse. In fact, nothing is quite as likely to undermine a person’s resourcefulness and self-confidence. The alternative? Affirmation. That’s all about speaking to people’s core competencies, values and strengths. And once you learn the art of affirmative communication, you can begin encouraging your children, colleagues and employees to become their best selves.  Actionable advice: Improve your self-awareness by journaling.  If you want to affirm others, you’ll need to develop a high level of self-awareness – the ability to recognize and manage your emotions, thoughts and ideas. Why? Well, if you’re grumpy or grouchy, there’s a good chance you’ll lash out at those around you rather than offering them supportive affirmation. That’s why it’s a good idea to start keeping a journal. Recording your feelings and interactions throughout the day sheds light on your inner emotional life and gives you invaluable insights into what you can do to improve.  Got feedback?

What to read next: Hannibal and Me, by Andreas Kluth. In these blinks, we’ve explored the neuroscience behind effective leadership. But that’s not the only source of wisdom available to leaders keen to hone their craft – the past also provides a wealth of insights. Take it from Andreas Kluth, a German journalist and economics expert whose first book explores the successes and failures of one of history’s greatest military strategists.  At the heart of his study is Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who almost succeeded in bringing the mighty Roman empire to its knees in the third century BC. But this isn’t just a meditation on the past: along the way, Kluth unpacks lessons on strategy, coping and the meaning of life for today’s go-getters. So if you’d like to take your leadership skills to the next level, why not check out our blinks to Hannibal and Me, by Andreas Kluth? ","headers":["What’s in it for me?

It was the first public event of its kind and resulted in a win for women everywhere. Yet, almost 50 years later, the fight for gender equality still rages on. The sole difference between sexism half a century ago and sexism today is that it’s now more casual and subtle, which makes it both more difficult to fight and harder to identify in the first place. If you’ve ever wondered whether you’re being oversensitive or if you’re in fact experiencing the brunt of some cold, hard sexism, then these blinks can help you out. They’ll help guide you through commonplace examples of sexist behavior and provide you with actionable advice to ensure that you’re better informed and capable of dealing with discrimination in the workplace. In these blinks, you’ll learn about bropriators and femenemies; how to become a better negotiator; and which speech patterns should be avoided. Remember when Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards, saying that her prize should’ve gone to Beyoncé? It may have appeared that Kanye was simply advocating for another woman, but if we take a closer look, we can see that something else was at play. Men often dominate women with words, forcing them into silence. This is exactly what Kanye did when he literally took the mic out of Taylor’s hands. Thankfully, there are ways for women to fight against these verbal maneuvers. When you find yourself in a situation with a man who interrupts you as you’re trying to speak – these guys are known as manterrupters – you should just keep talking. Then, call him out and suggest to your boss that no-interruption policies be established in the workplace. Another common situation is when a man takes credit for something a female employee has done. These men are called bropriators and, to handle them, women need to rightfully claim credit for what they’ve done; learn to speak with confidence and stand up for other female coworkers who aren’t getting the credit they deserve. Men should also be called out whenever they start mansplaining. This is when a man explains something to a woman in a condescending manner. When this happens, women should point it out and stop the “explanation” as quickly as possible. But dominating women by verbal means isn’t all men do. Men belittle women nonverbally, too. Here are some typical examples: expecting women to go on coffee runs, and assuming they’ll take notes during group sessions and clean up afterward. These expectations are demeaning because they lower women’s perceived value in the workplace. To fight this, women simply need to refuse such requests. In addition to verbal and nonverbal tactics, men also tend to attribute the legitimate feelings of women to biology. This is condescending and shouldn’t be tolerated. For example, when a woman feels upset, men will often say the same thing: she’s on her period. To fight this catchall assumption, women can get in the habit of telling men what’s actually causing them distress. So, men’s actions are often responsible for women not receiving a fair chance at work. However, women themselves aren’t completely blameless. Historically, women have been deemed the weaker sex, and they’re thus prone to feeling inadequate, often even sabotaging their own chances. An example of self-sabotage is imposter syndrome – a lack of belief in yourself and your abilities, which results in your feeling like a total fraud. This is something many women are familiar with, no matter where they’re at on the corporate ladder. Another example is the office mom persona, which you know you’ve adopted when you’re too modest and humble about your accomplishments. Taking this persona can result in you undervaluing yourself at work. Instead of letting these outdated and baseless perspectives dominate, women need to improve their self-confidence by practicing powerful poses. Research shows that adopting the stance of a comic book superheroine – like Wonder Woman, for example – will raise testosterone and confidence levels, even if you only do it for two minutes. Women also face difficulties in the workplace because of herfectionists. A herfectionist is a woman who puts overwhelming pressure on herself to be perfect in every single way, both at work and at home. According to a recent study on burnout, female employees are twice as likely as their male counterparts to feel “very exhausted” or “very tired.” So, to counteract the exhaustion brought on by attempting perfection, women need to focus more on balancing their work and personal lives, which means doing less overtime, managing stress and finding time for themselves. Furthermore, women are usually pitted against each other, exacerbating their lower position in the workplace. To illustrate the competition among females, consider the femenemy, a woman who discredits and demeans other women in order to get ahead. Women should avoid such behavior and instead help other women, either through hiring, promoting or mentoring. And femenemies should always be called out. Highlighting the importance of solidarity between women, diplomat and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright said, “There is a very special place in hell for women who don’t support other women.” Women in powerful roles are often perceived as bossy or overly ambitious. However, this has more to do with how we perceive leaders in general than with female leaders in particular. Historically, leadership roles have been filled by men, and, almost needless to say, degenderizing leadership is still a work in progress. Indeed, a Gallup poll in 2014 found that Americans favor male bosses over female ones. But, according to economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett, women aren’t the problem. Rather, leadership is generally viewed as an inherently male characteristic. So, to change this perspective, women leaders need to collaborate more with other women, either via mentoring or creating professional networks. It’s important to understand that successful women are an invaluable resource for other females and that working together is the only way for women to move forward and degenderize leadership. Today, women are undervalued, which is evidenced by how they’re treated. For example, women in leadership roles typically have to prove their intelligence more often than men do. It’s simply assumed that they’re not up to the task. Perhaps you’ve heard people say things like, “But you don’t look like an engineer,” when confronted with a woman occupying a position of power. When you hear these sorts of comments, the key is to ignore them and let your intelligence speak for itself. A woman’s value is also under pressure at work meetings, especially when she’s alone facing a roomful of men. Again, women should work together and ensure that their female colleagues have a voice and are being heard. One final pressure that affects women in leadership roles is the glass cliff. The glass cliff occurs when a failing company hires a woman, who is then held responsible when the company hits rock bottom. For example, Carly Fiorina became CEO of Hewlett Packard just prior to the burst of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s – and, shortly thereafter, the company recorded a massive financial loss. The company immediately blamed Fiorina for the loss, even though the bubble had been growing for years. What’s important to learn here is that women shouldn’t take responsibility for mistakes they didn’t commit. Remember to keep a collection of records as evidence that the company was failing before you had anything to do with it. Also, be sure to have your job responsibilities explicitly specified prior to signing any contracts. The way you sound is often just as important as what you say. In fact, before they pay attention to the words coming out of your mouth, people will judge you based on your speech pattern and the inflection of your voice. A woman’s speech pattern can sabotage how she is perceived. Filler words such as “like” and “um,” which women typically use more than men, detract from the importance of what’s being said. To get a sense of which fillers you use, record yourself speaking about a topic of your choice and then listen to the recording. Pay attention to your speech pattern and identify your fillers, and then make a conscious effort to eliminate them. Another filler women are prone to use is “sorry.” Try to avoid using it, even if only in a flippant manner, and especially in cases when you shouldn’t be apologetic. Similarly, hedges, such as, “I’m not sure if this is right, but…” should be avoided. They make you sound fearful of being incorrect, even if you’re right. Instead, learn to speak your mind and stop saying, “I feel like…” when you’re trying to argue a point. Beyond fillers, the two worst trends in female speech habits are upspeak and vocal fry. Upspeak refers to the tendency women have to intonate the end of their sentences, making statements sound more like questions. The more you speak up at the end of sentences, the lower your credibility sinks. Vocal fry occurs when women – and men! – elongate their vowels, resulting in croaky or creaky speech. People typically associate authority with resonant and clear voices, so try to avoid vocal fry in the workplace. Speech patterns may be hard to change at first. But it’s not impossible. Practice talking with a strong and powerful voice, and remember to refrain from upspeak. Eventually, you’ll see your colleagues and managers giving you the respect you deserve. Negotiation isn’t up everyone’s alley, but women tend to avoid it more than men, even if they deserve to be recognized for their work. Thankfully, there are tactics to help people – especially women – to become better negotiators. The key is persuasion. Women entering into a negotiation are already at a disadvantage due to the wage gap and the misperception of being pushy. As a precaution, women should keep track of their contributions to the company or have their colleagues back them up. Additionally, tools such as Glassdoor, a website that collects information on salaries from anonymous employees, can provide negotiators with useful data that support demands. Providing proof justifies what you’re asking for, as will explaining how an increase in your salary will be beneficial to the company. If a woman is told no during a negotiation, she should remember not to back down until given an explanation. To prepare yourself for pushback, practice making demands in front of a mirror. This way, you’ll know what to say when you face an unfavorable response. And, when a woman becomes good at negotiating, she should share her knowledge with other women. Open up about your salary with other females in your industry. You can even get together and create spreadsheets containing data on your salaries. Remember, evidence is persuasive. Just remember that women typically deserve better in the workplace. Know your worth and fight for a salary that reflects your contribution; we’ll be one step closer to closing that wage gap because of it. The key message in this book: Women face numerous gender-based obstacles on their path to success in the workplace. From self-sabotaging speech patterns to sexist behavior from male colleagues, the stumbling blocks are numerous. Women can overcome these barriers and improve their careers by being vocal about injustices, working on their negotiation skills and supporting other women. Actionable advice: Create your own feminist fight club. Gather a bunch of women from your industry and conduct regular meetings to exchange stories and experiences, as well as critical information on job salaries and opportunities. Build a network of support, and together you can wage war against sexism in the workplace and beyond! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But that’s not true. As the old saying goes, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” Success is all about working your networks – and this extends to cases far beyond classic networking to make new contacts. Caring for your network will expand business potential, increase innovation and diversity and set you on the path to achieving your ambitions. Author David Burkus will show you that your network is much larger than you think it is, and can quickly grow if you learn to reach out to the right people. Crucially, you’ll pick up a few techniques to increase your circle and ensure it is of high quality. Theory and practice together will get you where you need to go. In these blinks, you’ll learn why a hit song’s tune doesn’t actually matter; how The Four-Hour Workweek became a bestseller; and what card game led to a friendship between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates The value of a close friendship is not to be underrated. We all want to have people around who we trust and with whom we can share our feelings. But when it comes to work, if you’re going to be successful, you have to dump those emotional tendencies and work according to a different professional paradigm. Sociologically speaking, your close friends are those with whom you have strong social ties. But, if you cultivate ties with people you’re not so close to – that is, weak social ties – you’re going to be a better networker. Typically, when we're faced with challenges such as looking for a new job, we reach out to strong social ties or seek out job listings online. What’s all too readily forgotten are weak social ties, and that’s a big mistake. The problem with strong social ties is that they are often connected to each other as well as to you, like an interconnected cluster. In contrast, weak social ties tend to be connected to other social clusters, which means they'll spread news of your job search to entirely different groups of people. In fact, a Harvard University student named Mark Granovetter showed this to be scientifically true back in 1970. He surveyed people making job transitions and found that 83 percent of those who were successful in their search had managed it with the help of weak social ties. Interestingly enough, connecting with people you’re less close to also promotes innovation. In 2002, Martin Ruef, a sociology professor at Duke University, set about asking 700 start-ups how they had devised their business models. It turned out that practically all start-ups that had developed their business ideas from talking with weak social ties had more innovative business models than those who had relied on strong ties. This was indicated by the fact that these start-ups had, for example, filed for more patents to protect their original ideas. Additionally, Ruef and his researchers judged their ideas to be highly innovative when compared to business models and research typical of their fields. Remember those cliques in high school that all had their special spots in the cafeteria? It’s a universal experience: people have a natural tendency to gather in exclusive groups of familiar people. If you’ve ever tried to get to know new people at a house party, you’ll have seen the same thing in action. But, in truth, we’d all be better off trying to mingle with people we don’t know at all. That’s because connecting with utterly unfamiliar groups nourishes innovation.   This is illustrated by the story of an early nineteenth-century Cherokee silversmith named Sequoyah. He made contact not just with his native community, but also with American settlers. At the time, the Cherokee had no written language. But, so he could act as a link between the two communities, Sequoyah learned English. He started by learning to write his own name. Soon after, he was engraving it on his silverware. Sequoyah saw how the settlers sent letters to communicate with each other and decided to import the innovation. Through hard work, he developed a system of symbols that represented the different syllables of the Cherokee language. The syllabary was a raving success. The Cherokee soon adopted the script, and it remains in use to this day on street signs and in schools, especially in cities in Cherokee territory like Tahlequah, Oklahoma. There’s another benefit to connecting with unfamiliar groups. We saw earlier that it can help you in your job search, but there’s a good chance that it’ll be more generally beneficial to your career, too. Studies have shown that, in addition to being more innovative, you’ll also be awarded higher salaries and receive more promotions. In 2004, sociologist Ronald Burt conducted a study where he tasked 673 managers working at a major electronics company with improving the company’s supply-chain management. He found that managers who discussed the problem with people from different social clusters to their own were able to come up with the best ideas. As it happened, they were the same managers who already had the best paid and highest positions within the company. Clearly then, networking will take you far! The classic image of innovation and invention is that of a wiry, white-haired and bespeckled scientist at a lab bench, his cry of eureka echoing into the lonely void. But things aren’t like that anymore: innovation increasingly comes down to teamwork. Sociologist Brian Uzzi's 2007 article in the journal Science showed that innovation through teamwork in the scientific community had significantly increased over the previous 50 years. Uzzi's researchers analyzed over 20 million scientific studies published between 1955 and 2000, as well as the teams and individuals behind them. Interestingly, while the average size of a scientific team in 1955 was 1.9, by 2000 it had risen to 3.5. Furthermore, in 1955, only 17.5 percent of the total content of scientific papers was attributable to collaboration. Even then, it was mostly still scientists working alone and then compiling their findings after the fact. But by 2000, 51.5 percent of scientific work was being developed and executed by teams. On top of all that, the impact of team-produced papers also increased. In 1955, coauthored scientific papers were being referenced by peers 1.7 times as often as individually researched papers. But by 2000, that figure stood at 2.1. Uzzi returned to the question of innovation in 2005. He wanted to understand what made teams work well. Using a sample of scientific studies published between 1955 and 2004, he found that teams made up of researchers who had not collaborated before wound up publishing in the most high-profile periodicals. Surprisingly, successful teams who stuck together found it hard to keep the magic flowing. Their work received less recognition, generally only appearing in lower-profile publications. No one has yet successfully explained this phenomenon. But it’s likely that new team members bring new ideas and energy, something severely lacking in stale, established collaborations. In the Gospel according to Matthew, Jesus declares that those who already possess much will be sure to acquire more. In sociology, this is called the Matthew effect, and it applies to networking, too. Simply put, the more connected you are, the more connected you’ll get. It’s pretty logical, really: when people are out to make new contacts, they naturally look for people who already have lots of ties. It’s easy to visualize what happens next. When an already well-connected person starts piling up more links, they’re more likely to attract new people wanting to join their network. There’s a lesson in this. If networking seems hard at first, don’t worry; as your contacts accumulate, it will get easier. Another reason why networking becomes easier over time is that popularity is infectious and spreads quickly through social groups. This was the finding of sociologists Matthew Salganik and Peter Dodds in 2006. The pair set up a website where people could log in and listen to unfamiliar songs for free. But they actually created several different versions. In one, the visitors only saw the album’s title and artist’s name. In the other, it was also possible to see how many times a given song had been downloaded previously. It turned out that the participants were highly influenced by others’ choices. On the website version where it was possible to see others’ selections, certain songs rapidly became hits. In fact, one song soon outranked them all. In contrast, on the other site that displayed no such information, the same song only came in at spot 40 of 48. This very same principle applies to networking. If you’re connected and people know it, then others are going to come knocking at your door. Imagine that one of your friends was 100-feet tall. If you were then to calculate your friendship group’s average height, you’d find that this one measurement had skewed the average dramatically upward. In fact, you’d have to admit that you were shorter than average. The same idea holds true when comparing network sizes. Though many people like to imagine they have more friends and contacts than the average, they don’t. That’s because Super Connectors – people who have amassed mountains of contacts – will knock the average right out of whack. Social media only exacerbates the issue. In 2016, two McGill University computer scientists, Naghmeh Momeni and Michael Rabbit, analyzed millions of Twitter users' followers and tweets. They found that Super Connectors ruled the roost. Very few users boasted millions of followers, and the vast majority of users actually fell well short of the average number of followers, which stood at 155,657 at the time of the study. But there’s no need to get disheartened. It’s actually possible to become a Super Connector and to profit from it. Tim Ferriss is one such example. Before he published his best seller The Four-Hour Workweek in 2007, Ferriss was an unknown with no network to speak of. But he had a business plan up his sleeve. Ferriss worked out that his target audience would be men aged 18 to 35 and interested in technology. He therefore found the ten to 15 websites that were most popular with that demographic. After that, Ferriss targeted their owners: he attended conferences where he could meet them and struck up informal conversations that quickly segued into full-blown product pitches. Before long, most of these online bloggers and journalists were posting about him – the illusion had been created. To hordes of tech geeks, Ferris seemed to be a Super Connector. They came flooding to him, his book became a best seller and he became a genuine Super Connector for the first time. The old saying goes that birds of a feather flock together, and there’s a lot of truth in that. Just look at how US elections are split between increasingly polarized Democrats and Republicans. And science confirms the proverb: humans tend to cluster into groups of people similar to themselves. In 2009, sociologists Duncan Watt and Gueorgi Kossinets sat down to examine the email flow between the students at a large American university over the course of a year. They not only kept track of the emails and new recipients that appeared; they also created student profiles detailing age, gender, course choices and a number of other attributes. Watt and Kossinets found that students who shared similar characteristics were far more likely to get in contact with one another. However, they also discovered that this occurred because similar students tended to hang out in the same places on campus, studied in the same department or were even in the same course of study. A preference for similar people had consequences over time, too. Similar people started to cluster, and so the likelihood of meeting more similar people just kept on increasing. The repercussions of this sort of behavior are plain to see: people’s preference for more of the same makes it harder to establish diversity. Entrepreneurs and journalists Alex Blumberg and Matt Lieber learned just that in 2015, soon after founding Gimlet Media, a company that develops and sells podcasts. They noticed that their staff was almost entirely white, liberal and cosmopolitan, and they soon realized what had caused this. Blumberg and Lieber had mainly been recruiting from among their fellow New York-based journalists. And that was itself a replicating pool of talent that had been attracting similar types for decades. While they were happy that the company was doing well, they also recognized the importance of diversity, and that it wasn’t going to happen by itself – they would have to consciously start recruiting people from more diverse backgrounds. There’s a lesson in this example. Networking works best when you connect with different groups. Therefore, you’ll have to make a deliberate effort to do that so you don’t end up mingling with carbon copies of yourself and no one else. Whether you’re an introvert who’s mortified by the idea of social mixers, or an extrovert who finds them boring, you’ll be relieved to know that skipping them altogether is probably your best option. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, when you’re attending social mixers, you’re likely to spend most of the time talking to people you already know. In 2009, two business professors at Columbia University, Paul Ingram and Michael Morris, conducted a study to examine interactions at social mixers. They fitted students and business executives at the university with recording devices and tracked conversations that occurred during evening drinks on campus. Fascinatingly, they found that although 95 percent of the participants in the event classified themselves as \"highly motivated\" to meet new people, they actually spent at least 50 percent of their time conversing with old acquaintances. Secondly, even if you do decide to approach new people, the tendency is to head toward people who are similar to you. They’re probably also in the same network already, and so are hardly going to help you branch out into new ones. The message here is that social events are not the way to go. People actually bond more easily through shared activities. That’s the way to network! Behavioral scientist Jon Levy has put this thinking into practice. He regularly organizes dinner parties for movers and shakers. But Levy’s dinner parties are hardly run of the mill. When guests arrive at his New York home, they are split up into teams and then prepare the evening meal together. The guests may not disclose their identities or their occupations and, consequently, social hierarchies are eliminated. Once dinner is served, the guests play games during which they guess the identity of each diner in turn. Levy’s dinner parties have been a huge success – and not just on the night in question. His guests have gone on to collaboratively create start-ups and TV series! Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are probably the two biggest business magnates there are. Interestingly, they collaborate with one another as well. It’s a relationship based on a friendship that began while playing bridge in 1991. This demonstrates how friendships can lead to successful business relationships, too. In 2009, sociologists Simone Ferriani and Fabio Fonti contacted hundreds of companies in the Bologna area in Italy, where their university was based. They asked the companies who their suppliers were and drew maps of the companies’ business connections. Then, the company leaders detailed who they went to for advice or whom they just considered friends. Ferriani and Fonti then made a separate map for company-friendship connections. Needless to say, the researchers found that business connections and friendships often overlapped with each other. At this point, they asked participants what had come first, the business relationship or the friendship? Interestingly, when a friendship formed the foundation of a relationship, the probability of the two friends also going into business together was double that of a business connection resulting in friendship. Speaking of friendship, research has also shown that there is much to be gained when business colleagues become friends. In 2015, management researcher Jessica Methot examined whether work performance improved when friendships existed between work colleagues. She surveyed the employees of a large insurance company and mapped out the primary work connections within the company. Employees with work friends were found to be better performers when independently evaluated by their superiors. However, employees who had work friends also tended to get more emotionally drained than those without. That’s most probably because maintaining relationships requires emotional investment. Emotional fatigue seemed to slightly reduce work performance, but this was more than made up for by the increase in performance resulting from the added motivation of having a friend at work. So there we are! You now know that it’s necessary to network because it can boost your creativity and innovative power. And you’ve also learned how to do it – not least by avoiding social mixers. Before you know it, you’ll be on your way to becoming a Super Connector with a soaring career! The key message in these blinks: Networks aren’t just about networking, but that’s where you have to start. To most people, networking means going out and talking to strangers, but it’s not quite that simple – you need to be aware of who you’re talking to and also cultivate weak social ties. Once established, a proper network will diversify teams and contacts, leading to increased productivity and innovation. Shared activities are also more likely to break down social barriers and build stronger networks, and always remember that great friendships can lead to fantastic business partnerships.  Actionable advice: Learn from your friends. Teamwork is becoming increasingly important in modern workplaces, but you don’t even need to be part of a formal team to learn from others. Just invite your friends out and ask them what they do at their jobs. Instead of zoning out while thinking about your own problems, really listen to what they have to say, and see if you can learn something from them. Got feedback?

On the one hand, you’ve got firms that believe success is a matter of strong company culture. On the other, there are organizations that put utter faith in the strength of their brand. In today’s dog-eat-dog market, it’s crucial to stay ahead of the curve and make the right choices. So what should you bet on – brand or culture? Well, the giants of the business world know that this is a false dilemma. The true answer is to fuse the two together. If you can combine your brand and your culture into a seamless whole, you’ll release company power like you’ve never seen before. From identifying core values to pinpointing company purpose, conducting a culture audit to engaging in rituals, these blinks will lead you through the fusion process and help you harness the energy it’ll release. These blinks also reveal the price Volkswagen paid for its poor culture–brand alignment; part of Airbnb’s recipe for success; and how Amazon leverages Darwinism. All light on earth, and very nearly all heat, is generated by a star that’s almost 100 million miles away: the sun. It takes astronomical amounts of energy to produce such heat and brightness, and yet the sun, like a cosmic light bulb, remains undimmed despite billions of years of burning. So where does this energy come from? The answer is simple: nuclear fusion. When the nuclei of two separate atoms fuse and become one – in the sun’s case, hydrogen nuclei are constantly fusing, thus forming helium – a massive amount of energy is released. But the power of fusion isn’t limited to physics and the energy production of celestial bodies. It can also be applied to business. For most businesses, company brand and company culture are distinct – two atoms that, though close to one another, never fully merge. Such businesses may do well enough, but they won’t achieve cosmic success until they move beyond this model and harness the power of brand–culture fusion. Amazon, a star-like company if ever there was one, uses fusion to maintain its position at the center of the consumer-goods universe. How so, you ask? Well, think about what defines Amazon’s external brand. It’s famous for its ruthless pursuit of innovative ways to provide a superior customer experience, right? Now think about its internal culture. Amazon isn’t shy about broadcasting its rough-and-tumble modus operandi, using words like “bruising,” “relentless” and “burn and churn” to describe its approach to internal processes. It’s certainly survival of the fittest at Amazon, which isn’t an ideal environment for everyone, and yet this interior culture of “purposeful Darwinism” is as tactical as it is taxing. Indeed, it aligns exactly with Amazon’s external brand: they will relentlessly pursue opportunities to deliver the superior customer experiences that their brand promises, creating the brand–culture fusion that generates the company’s sun-like power. The fusion of brand and culture guarantees three major benefits: First, it aligns your employees by making the company objective crystal clear. With everyone pursuing this objective, and no one working at cross-purposes, your company’s efficiency will improve significantly. Second, it gives you a competitive edge. The competition may be able to imitate what you do (which is a matter of branding), but they’ll have a harder time reproducing how you do it, let alone why, since these are about culture. Third, by making your company inimitable, brand–culture fusion also makes it authentic – and authenticity is what will give you credibility in the eyes of your customers. “Just Do It.” The words alone conjure images of fleet-footed athletes, their Nike-shod feet pounding the asphalt or the track – people who, equipped with the right footwear, don’t merely think about pursuing their athletic dreams. They do it. We all know this slogan because it perfectly fuses Nike’s brand and culture. That is, it takes Nike’s internal culture, which is fueled by founder Phil Knight’s belief that, if everyone “ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place,” and externalizes it with a pithy and powerful brand message: “Just Do It.” If you want to achieve similar fusion, you’ll first have to pinpoint your company’s purpose. A strong purpose not only drives company culture, uniting employees who might otherwise remain unconnected; it also lends itself to company survival. In a cutthroat marketplace, a company with a weak purpose will soon be superseded by companies with stronger ones. We’re not talking about mere money-making. Your purpose is the why behind your company’s existence. Here are some examples of company purposes: Amazon strives to be “earth’s most customer-centric company.” Henry Ford sought “to build a car for the great multitude.” And Google wants to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” The best way to unearth your company’s purpose is to conduct a simple exercise. It’s called the Five Whys. Step one is to describe your product or service. Then ask yourself why that product or service is important. Once you’ve answered that question, ask yourself why your response is important. Repeat this process five times. With each answer, you’ll get closer to the heart of your purpose and, by answer number five, you’ll probably have a clear idea of what it truly is. While considering your company purpose, you should also pin down its core values. Whereas purpose expresses the why of your company, core values articulate its how – that is, the unique approach that sets it apart from all other companies. Core values function as a bridge between the external brand and the internal culture; they fuse the two into a seamless whole. And whether you value transparency or collaboration, quality or fun, you should try to articulate these values in a compelling and concrete way. For instance, Google’s value statement doesn’t simply give pride of place to “quality.” It says that “great just isn’t good enough.” We’ll take a closer look at core values in the next blink. If you want to construct a bridge, you’ve got to know a thing or two about the land you’re building on. If you don’t, the bridge will probably collapse. So, before you begin construction on the bridge that is your core values, let’s assess the terrain being bridged – that is, your external brand and your internal culture. First, you’ve got to identify your brand type. In total, there are nine brand types: disruptive, conscious, service, innovative, value, performance, luxury, style and experience. Now, a company belonging to a particular brand type will conduct itself much like all other companies within that brand type; it’ll employ similar strategies and strive to gain a similar competitive position within its market. For example, both Nike and Apple belong to the same brand type – innovative. Neither their products, nor their markets, nor their target customers have much in common, and yet both companies go about their business in much the same way. Each is determined to create cutting-edge products. In other words, they have the same core values, emphasizing things like inventiveness, experimentation and continuous improvement. Since every company belonging to the same brand type will have very similar core values, the best way to identify those values is to determine your brand type. So review the list of nine, figure out where you fit in and go from there. If you’re a service brand, like the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain, you’ll value care, humbleness and empathy. If you’re a value brand, like Walmart, you’ll prioritize low prices and good value-for-money. Once you’ve determined your brand type, you should do a culture audit, which will show you whether your current values are indeed in keeping with your core values. Here are two things to look at when auditing your company culture: How is communication – whether with employees or customers or stakeholders – handled in your company? Does the CEO sign and send heartfelt thank-you notes? If so, your company might have a personal culture. Or are all issues dealt with in company-wide web chats? This would point to a culture that’s tech-savvy and democratically oriented. And which employee policies and procedures are in place? Is there a dress code? If not, then your culture is probably more casual. What about policies regarding vacation time and sick leave? Such things reveal a lot about the strictness or flexibility of the company’s culture. Once you’ve analyzed your company’s existing culture, you can assess whether it truly chimes with the core values you identified earlier. For the nuclei of two atoms to fuse, there must be a great deal of heat. And, in the realm of business, that heat is provided by leadership. So let’s consider two examples – one of leadership that led to a successful brand–culture fusion and one of leadership that simply wasn’t hot enough. After the 2008 financial crisis, Ford Motor Company wasn’t doing well. Luckily, it was led by a fantastic CEO: Alan Mulally. Under Mulally’s leadership, the company not only became profitable again; it also never resorted to a government bailout, unlike all other major American automobile producers. So how did Mulally pull this off? Well, he introduced a vision. Called “One Ford,” this vision harked back to company founder Henry Ford’s initial purpose: “to build a car for the great multitude.” This reinvigorated the company, inspiring everyone to work toward making the Ford brand what it once was – a beacon of progress and egalitarian values. In other words, Mulally realigned the external brand with the internal purpose, fusing the two and generating the energy necessary to turn the company around. In stark contrast to Mulally’s stellar leadership, consider the missteps made at another prominent automobile manufacturer, Volkswagen. For decades, the brand of this German car company stood for honesty and authenticity. However, its leaders didn’t promote these values internally – a fact that became disastrously apparent in the fall of 2015, when it was revealed that Volkswagen had lied about emission levels. Indeed, the company’s leadership had encouraged a high-and-mighty culture and promoted the idea that a superior product put them above the law. Of course, this glimpse of what the company was really like drove many customers away. To avoid this fate, you should lead in such a way that brand–culture fusion is inevitable. But what does that entail? For starters, you should always communicate the company purpose and core values to employees. Be consistent and remember: there’s no such thing as too much communication. However, actions say more than words. So, as a leader, you must act in a way that reinforces company culture, especially when you’re deciding who to hire and who to fire. These decisions should be driven by your core values. If a potential employee already lives your company’s values, then that person will make a good hire. On the other hand, if a current employee doesn’t live those values, he should be let go, even if he’s a solid worker. The values of your workers will radiate throughout the company, so it’s up to you to make adjustments when necessary. Traditional business wisdom holds that company culture and company structure have little in common. Sure, a strong culture is good and nice – but it’s the “soft” side of business and has little to do with more solid matters, such as how a company ought to be structured and run. But this approach is as outdated as it is ineffective. Today, it’s imperative that company culture and company structure combine to constitute a seamless whole. To see how this works, let’s look at the software company Adobe. For a long time, Adobe didn’t prioritize user support. And it didn’t need to: its software was mostly distributed by the companies on whose products Adobe ran. But then the company shifted its business model and started prioritizing direct sales to customers – so, to effect cultural change that would support this new priority, they made some structural shifts. To reinforce the new, customer-focused approach, the Adobe management fused two departments into one. Customer support and human resources joined forces, and the “customer and employee experience” department was born. This department championed the new culture, which sought to make both customers and employees feel supported and valued, and to provide both with the same high-quality experience. The cultural change at Adobe wasn’t merely the side effect of structural change. It was an integral part of it. So, if company culture is lacking, consider making some structural adjustments. Consider what effect your business model, be it hierarchical or democratic, has on your company culture, and make adjustments accordingly. And give thought to the cultural influence exerted by rules and standards, whether within teams or across the entire company. For instance, Google tries to foster a workplace environment where quality ideas can be realized swiftly. To this end, it created the “rule of seven,” which states that every employee should have access to seven people at Google who have the power to turn particularly promising ideas into a reality. Culture is often a matter of creation, whether that means creating new rules or new roles. At LinkedIn, there’s a role called “Culture Champion.” If an employee volunteers for this job, it’s up to her to ensure that her fellow employees have a fantastic experience at work. In the first decade of the 2000s, a series of cosmic explosions lit up the business universe. These sky-shattering bursts gave birth to the companies that now dominate the corporate heavens, such as Facebook, Uber and Airbnb. In order not to die out, some of these star-like companies have tapped into the power of brand–culture fusion. Airbnb is one of them. It has managed this, in part, by aligning its employee experience (EX) with its customer experience (CX). You should strive to do this, too. Airbnb already has some key components in place. It has a clear purpose – “to help create a world where you can belong anywhere” – and its brand slogan, “Belong Anywhere,” perfectly communicates this purpose. Brand and culture are already fused. However, Airbnb strengthens this fusion by extending its purpose not only to customers but to employees as well. For example, Airbnb offices are designed with belonging in mind, and they feature homey amenities, such as a kitchen and a library, as well as areas for meditating and doing yoga. Additionally, each employee receives $2,000 per year toward vacations, as long as they stay with Airbnb hosts, and they are also encouraged to become hosts themselves. When employees truly understand the customer experience, they are more likely to share and improve that experience. Airbnb knows this, and so tries to make EX and CX as similar as possible. So how do you design an EX that will serve the CX? Well, there are four basic steps. First, separate your employees into groups. Which employees are most valuable to your company? Which are truly living your core values? Such questions will help you identify the employee groups that are most valuable to your company. Second, figure out which employee interactions are more important than all others. Different employees will value different interactions, and since there’s no way to cater to the preferences of every employee, you should focus on prioritizing interactions that benefit and satisfy your most valuable employee groups. Maybe you value senior staff, and they cherish the opportunities for education and personal betterment that your company provides. Or maybe you value young talent, and they benefit most from basic training and other onboarding activities. The third step is to select and design elements that will form the experience of your employees, particularly those in your most valued employee groups. Consider the work environment (things like office lighting and layout), tools (such as technology and materials) and intangibles (things like communication guidelines and other policies). Fourth and finally, try to create experiences for your valued employees that will strengthen company culture through, for example, the right kind of office environment. Bwaaaaaam. The resonant tone of a conch-shell horn fills the room, and a man sporting a traditional Hawaiian outfit emerges and solemnly conducts a traditional blessing for the people assembled. Thus commences the annual customer conference of Salesforce, a software company whose CEO, Marc Benioff, has a soft spot for Hawaiian culture. So why all the shell-blowing and Hawaiian getups? Well, during this conference, Salesforce strives to give customers a glimpse of its company culture – and that culture is encapsulated in rituals, specifically Hawaiian ones. Whether or not you decide to emulate a particular culture, one thing is for sure: ritualistic activities will positively impact your culture. Here’s how Salesforce reaps the benefits of rituals: Its company culture is centered on a Hawaiian concept called ohana, which means family, and each employee relies on all the others as they’d rely on family members. This bond holds the company together. Ohana also drives company-wide practices. For instance, instead of simply saying “hey” or “hi,” Salesforce employees use a Hawaiian greeting – “aloha,” which means “love,” and end emails with the sign-off “mahalo,” which signifies gratitude and thanks. And, of course, Friday is Hawaiian-shirt day. At Salesforce, this article of clothing signifies employee solidarity and affirms the ohana-oriented culture. Rituals concentrate employees’ focus on your company’s core values, so the best way to identify suitable rituals for your organization is to start with those values and let them lead you to the right activities. Like Salesforce, you could draw on other cultures for inspiration, or you could come up with rituals of your own. As long as the ritual reinforces your values, you’re good to go. Artifacts – that is, objects that serve as visual manifestations of your company culture – are another tool for nurturing your business. For instance, if you were to enter a conference room at Salesforce, you’d soon learn that you were in the Maka Luana room or the Hala Kahiki room, or any of the other rooms with Hawaiian-themed names. The names make visible the otherwise invisible ohana culture. Can you think of a name, or an object (Salesforce also gives out surfboard-shaped awards), that conjures up the core values your company promotes? If so, you may have found an artifact. Company culture is often abstract, which can make it hard for employees to rally around. Rituals and artifacts give it tangible form. Rituals and artifacts are tools of engagement – they encourage employees to form a relationship with your brand. This is a great first step, but since employee engagement is central to brand–culture fusion, you’ll have to do more than encourage engagement. You’ll have to ensure it. How? Well, let’s look at Mitchell International, a software company that successfully used one of the most effective techniques out there: the brand-engagement program. Mitchell International already knew its core values and expressed them with a solid brand slogan, “The Mitchell Way.” It even provided all employees with literature detailing those values. But, still, it hadn’t fully instilled this brand identity. So it staged a day-long event whose sole purpose was to engage employees with the brand and culture. Prior to “The Mitchell Way Day,” various departments made little exhibits, like those you might find at a science fair; each presented the way in which that particular department’s customer service was driven by the company’s core values. For example, one team’s exhibit involved the swing of a golf club – a swift, simple movement that served as a metaphor for the process they’d devised for customers. Clearly, brand-engagement programs are a fantastic way to bring out employee creativity and solidify employee commitment. So here are two activities you might use when staging your own program: Set up stations that play recordings of customers discussing their experience with the brand. These customer listening booths will not only teach employees how the brand is seen; they’ll also spark discussion about brand improvement and deepen employee empathy. Or have employees seek out images – in magazines, for instance, or online – that capture the brand identity and ask them to make a brand identity collage. This is a perfect method for reinforcing their understanding. Did you know that Patagonia, the outdoor apparel company, only uses 100-percent organic cotton? Or that its products incorporate recycled material? These internal decisions send a strong external message: Patagonia is committed to helping the environment. Indeed, Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia’s founder, has championed the natural world since his business’s birth in 1973. And this culture of environmental commitment is perfectly fused with the company brand; indeed, it’s what defines Patagonia’s identity. So, if you’re trying to strengthen your brand, consider taking a page out of Patagonia’s book and using your internal culture to fuel your external brand. How? Well, think about internal decisions that will give definition to your brand – like Patagonia’s decision to commit to organic cotton, or, to cite another example, its acceptance of used-clothing donations that it resells. Both these decisions help the environment and reinforce the brand because Patagonia customers tend to be just as committed to preserving nature as the company is. Another way to build your brand from the inside out is to use your core values to determine your brand type. Since each brand type has a corresponding set of core values, you can establish your brand identity by establishing those values. So, for instance, if a particular university values “achievement” and “excellence,” then it’s not hard to figure out that it belongs to the performance brand type. On the other hand, if that university prioritizes experimental teaching methods and cutting-edge programs, then its brand type is clearly innovative. Whichever way you go about it, be sure to draw on your internal culture. This won’t only make your brand stand out it is also the sole way to truly achieve brand–culture fusion. The key message in these blinks: Your company brand is a great source of power, as is your company culture. However, when fused together, these two resources can release truly cosmic energy. So, rather than thinking of your brand as merely external and your culture as merely internal, bring the two together, allowing them to interact and strengthen each other. This is the only way to ensure that customers truly engage with the brand and employees truly engage with the culture. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But that’s only the foundation of what it takes to build and nurture a healthy relationship. Open-mindedness, and our general attitude toward those around us, is just as important. In these blinks, you’ll find a toolbox full of tips and ideas that you can immediately start using to create a healthier work environment. With these tools, managers will be better equipped to build strong teams, not to mention construct safe and comfortable places where employees feel respected and appreciated. And any employee eager to improve relations with coworkers can use them, too. In these blinks, you’ll find how to open your own emotional bank account; why it’s important to listen more and talk less; and how to make employee feedback less dreadful. It can happen to anyone: you think you have a complete understanding of something – and then, one fateful day, you discover that you had it all wrong. Each of us experiences the world in a different way, but sometimes we get stuck seeing the world from a point of view that has room for only one truth. As a result, we adopt standard perceptions about ourselves and about others, and we begin to believe that this perception is the only reality. You might get stuck thinking thoughts, such as, “I’m just not good enough,” “I’ll never change,” “My coworker is lazy” or “My friend is thoughtless.” Here’s a common scenario: a coworker approaches you, saying that he’s frustrated with another colleague because he thinks that she’s so slow and lazy that she’s going to cause everyone to miss their deadlines. This is what the author, Todd Davis, was confronted with when his colleague Jon came to him with his concerns about their coworker Isabel. Now, Jon wanted Davis to talk to Isabel, because Jon believed that he wasn’t a “people person.” So, in Jon’s case, we have someone who believes himself to be bad at dealing with others, and perceives Isabel as being slow and plodding. This is his truth, but it doesn’t have to be. The better mind-set is to reject narrow viewpoints about yourself, others and the world. It’s your responsibility to take stock of your beliefs, keep an open mind and hold yourself accountable for any narrow-minded perspectives you might have about yourself, the world or the people in your life. You should also stay open to the perspective of others. The author reminded Jon that he was a good husband and father. Therefore, he likely isn’t so bad at communicating, and if he put his mind to it, he could probably have a productive conversation with Isabel. Perhaps he wasn’t as inept around people as he’d long believed. Jon eventually realized that he’d unfairly labeled Isabel as slow and lazy, without taking the time to talk to her about it or understand her work ethic. Here’s another unfortunately common scenario: A rude customer complains and you lose your temper, firing off a curt email in reply. After some time passes, you cool off and realize how badly you reacted. In situations like these, we have a tendency to let outside factors, over which we have no control, dictate our mood and feelings. For example, how would you react if you found out that a colleague had been secretly working on a competing project behind your back? Surely, you can imagine how this external event might result in your feeling brimful of bitterness the next time you saw the person. When Todd Davis was a young recruiter, he hired a new colleague who managed to negotiate a salary that was far higher than his own. Davis was infuriated that his boss had approved this decision, which made him feel as though his work were being undervalued and unappreciated. For days, he complained to friends and family while feeling unmotivated and in the dumps. This is a common reaction to unpleasant external events, but there’s a far better way to deal. And the first step is to stop and quietly take a moment to reconsider the situation. Pausing is a great way to stay in control of your mood and feelings. When you allow yourself to calmly stop and think about what’s happening, you give yourself the time to develop a more nuanced understanding of the situation. With calm reflection, you can begin to understand your feelings and why you’re tempted to react in certain ways, which can lead to better solutions than casting yourself as the victim. After days of complaining, Davis finally paused to consider the situation and he came up with a much better response. He thought to himself, “Why not talk to my boss and ask for a raise?” Sure enough, his boss was receptive to the idea of raising his salary, as long as Davis worked a bit faster on his recruitment tasks in the future. So remember to cool down, breathe and take five minutes to think things over. You’ve probably heard about how important trust is to any successful relationship. It’s true – if people don’t think you’re credible, chances are they won’t have much respect for you. So the challenge is to prove to others that you are indeed a credible person, which can be done by demonstrating that you have character and are competent at what you do. It also helps to show your capacity for long-term thinking and being adaptable to changing situations. And don’t try to make up for a deficiency in competence by overdeveloping your character, or vice versa. For example, let’s say you’re preparing to skydive. Would you trust the person preparing your parachute if he had loads of character – meaning he was kind and thoughtful – but wasn’t a competent parachute-preparer? On the flip side, what if he had a wealth of experience but demonstrated a lack of character by being arrogant and emotionally unstable? Would you want him to be responsible for your safety? Then there’s the importance of displaying a long-term perspective, which is another way of showing your colleagues that you’re thoughtful, considerate and can be trusted to see things through to the end. A long-term perspective also comes in handy when you’re new to a job. It’s normal for your boss or the CEO to hesitate before taking you under his or her wing. She might want to take some time to see some results. If the boss comes off as cold at first, being mindful of the long-term can keep you focused on earning that credibility in her eyes and winning her over in time. Finally, there’s the advantage of being adaptable and flexible in new situations. It’s not uncommon for a manager to give you a goal or a deadline and leave it up to you to figure out how to get it done. But what if you get a new manager who wants you to provide constant updates on your progress and your planning methods? You could complain and say that this isn’t how you’re used to working, which will likely hurt your reputation, or you can demonstrate credibility by showing a willingness to adapt. The choice is yours. You may think that you have one job, but, in the big picture, most of us play many roles. We’re parents, siblings, spouses, friends, as well as teachers, managers and mentors. We can perform multiple roles simultaneously because of our ability to find balance. What you want to avoid is desperately trying to juggle all these roles at once. And at the same time, you don’t want to focus on one role at the expense of all others. Consider a man the author knows well – Ruben, who is an executive, a parent and a husband. Ruben loves his family dearly, but he used to live his life off-balance. Once, his wife and children sat for a family portrait without him since, according to him, he was too busy with work. After this event, Ruben knew he’d placed too much importance on his executive role and he made a promise to himself: he’d never miss another family event like this again. The first step to achieving balance is to identify all the roles you play, including the professional ones – be it graphic artist or tax advisor – and the personal ones, such as girlfriend, sister or animal-shelter volunteer. Then, carefully consider which are the most important. These should be the roles you’ve chosen for yourself, based on your personal values – not the ones you perform in order to please others. So, if you’re studying to be a doctor to satisfy your parents’ wishes, while taking acting classes because you’re passionate about theater, the role of med school student should rank far lower. The next step is to decide how much time and energy you want to contribute to each role, which you can do by making a contribution statement. This is basically a list of statements that explain your intentions. The contribution statement for the role of a mother might say, “I will provide my children with unconditional love, support and safety to ensure that they feel empowered to reach their goals in life.” You’re probably familiar with Albert Einstein, but what about Michelangelo Besso? The name might not ring a bell, but he was the one who saw the potential in the young Einstein after the budding genius had been kicked out of grammar school. If you want to follow Besso’s lead, and not that of the many others who underestimated Einstein, then you need to look past first impressions and recognize the true potential that lies within the people around you. Whether it’s coworkers, friends or employees, we should look beyond what people are today and instead see what they could become and how they might grow. Rather than seeing a scrawny seedling, we should recognize the tall and strong tree it can become. When Todd Davis started out as a recruitment manager, he got lucky. His boss believed in him much more than Davis believed in himself – and so he introduced Davis to one of the senior leaders and proceeded to list all of Davis’s accomplishments, even though he’d only worked there for 35 days. Even though Davis didn’t think much of his work so far, his boss looked at his minor accomplishments as a sign of great potential. This gave him a much-needed boost in self-confidence while also motivating him to continue the good work. Another useful tip is to avoid getting distracted from what’s important due to other things appearing more urgent. Whether it’s responding to a text or an email, non-urgent distractions can often seem pressing even though they get you no closer to achieving your goals. The better activity is to reflect on your goals, both personal and professional, and think about what you can do in the days ahead to strengthen your relationships with colleagues, friends and loved ones. There will always be urgent matters to attend to, but you’ll be less likely to waste time when you set up daily and weekly goals to make sure the important stuff doesn’t get neglected. There’s a common misconception that there’s only so much room at the top. Therefore, if someone else is experiencing success, there must be a certain amount of success being taken away from you. But this zero-sum philosophy is a poor approach to life, especially when it comes to your career. Whether it’s your private life or your work life, you shouldn’t put yourself above others, nor should you put the concerns of others ahead of your own. Instead, you should always have a “we” frame of mind and try to create an interdependent relationship between you and your colleagues. By thinking “we,” colleagues can focus on collaboration instead of competing. So, rather than feeling threatened by someone’s strengths, you can think about how to best combine your talents with theirs. Remember, we learn from others, and collaboration offers a great way to gain new talents and pass on your knowledge to someone else. Once, after the author had prepared a presentation at work, a colleague decided that entire sections needed to be rewritten. At first enraged, Davis soon cooled down thanks to a friend’s gentle reminder that the colleague only wanted to make the presentation as good as possible. This helped Davis realize that some of the comments did improve the presentation. And that, in fact, he could actually learn a thing or two from this collaboration. Collaborations should be seen as win-win situations, but, for this to happen, you need to find the balance between courage and consideration. Courage is what it takes to respectfully express your opinions, and consideration is what you give others when listening to theirs. By displaying both traits, you’ll reach a win-win situation that will benefit you and your colleagues by allowing all of you to share and learn. And once you engage in this kind of collaboration, you’ll quickly see how much better and more productive it is than being stuck in a competitive environment. It can help to think about your work relationships like a bank account, but rather than depositing and withdrawing money, you’ll add and withdraw things like trust and encouragement. Such transactions, however, require that you keep close tabs on your emotional bank account (EBA). This way, you can rest assured that your work relationships aren’t withdrawing more than they’re depositing. As with a normal bank account, you want your EBA to have a high balance, with a surplus of trust, engagement and confidence in the people you work with. There are some practices that can help you maintain a healthy balance in your EBA. First of all, don’t dispense trust or encouragement only when you expect to withdraw these from someone else later on. One of the author’s colleagues kept careful track of every thank-you note he received so that he could track who deserved a favor from him at a later date. And if he ever needed a helping hand on a task, he’d check his scorecard to see who was “in debt” to him. This isn’t the way to do things. Such working conditions are unhealthy and make all interactions seem manipulative, insincere and dubious, all of which can undermine good relationships. And this leads us to the next practice for a healthy EBA: keeping a close eye on your motives to make sure they stay honest. Once you start engaging in dishonorable or dishonest actions, your relationships will begin to erode. So don’t take credit for someone else’s work or belittle the efforts of a coworker just to get on your boss’ good side. Honorable motives are driven by a sincere wish to improve everyone’s situation, not just your own. Walt Disney had a very unselfish attitude about the workplace. He believed that every employee had the potential for creating great value and exceeding expectations. So he gave them room to explore and grow, and, because of this, the employees and the customers benefited – not just Disney himself. If you go to the self-help section of any bookstore, you can find plenty of advice on how to be better at speaking and communicating, and most of it’s about delivering your message quickly and clearly. But what often goes unmentioned is the benefit of listening well. To really listen, you have to do more than just close your mouth, nod occasionally and agree with what your interlocutor is saying. Listening requires a sincere interest and desire to understand the other person’s opinion or whatever concerns and problems she may have. In order to demonstrate active listening during a conversation, and to show the other person that you’re paying attention, it can help to reflect back on what you’ve heard the person say. Another good technique is to ask questions that clarify what the other person is saying. This both shows that you’re listening and that you’re trying to understand what’s at the heart of the person’s message. Now, there are many advantages to listening – but there are an equal number of disadvantages to not listening. Foremost among them is that you can cause the speaker to feel ignored or misunderstood, which can damage your relationship. For example, the author has a friend named Gary. Once, on the verge of landing a new client, Gary got an unpleasant surprise – the potential client turned him down. When Gary asked for a reason, he was told that whenever they had a meeting, Gary was always busy telling them how perfectly his company was going to meet their needs – so busy that he never stopped to listen to what those needs actually were. Gary learned the hard way that people begin to feel understood when we stop and listen. When we sincerely listen, it creates a safe space for the speaker to share his concerns. And it often turns out that this act of listening is all the speaker needs to solve the problem himself. By feeling free to talk, the speaker is forced to organize his thoughts about why he feels the way he does, which is often all it takes for a solution to present itself. You’ve probably heard the saying that there’s no such thing as too much of a good thing. Well, when it comes to working relationships, this isn’t exactly accurate. It might sound counterintuitive, but adhering too much to your personal strengths can hinder progress and damage relationships. For example, let’s say your strength is efficiency and making the most of your time. This is probably very beneficial for dealing with your personal work, but if you’re constantly obsessing about other people doing things a certain way, it can quickly become an issue of inflexibility. A manager who’s so proud of her time-management skills could end up micromanaging her staff so much that she never listens to their ideas. And it’s not hard to imagine that her staff could come to feel undervalued and not trusted to be able to complete a task on their own. When you’re constantly pushing your talents on others, you can block them from coming up with their own solutions and prevent the great energy and creativity that comes with collaboration. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t use your strengths; just make sure you aren’t doing so at the expense of your relationships. Remember, good working relationships require trust – and employees need to feel that their boss trusts them to do their job well. With this trust in place, the employee will feel more confident and probably do better work. Another of the author’s friends, Sierra, experienced the benefit and morale boost that came from being trusted by her boss, Janeen. With full confidence in Sierra’s potential, Janeen didn’t hesitate to give her work that would help her grow and strengthen new skills. With this kind of trust, Sierra was motivated to work harder and not let her boss down. Of course, trust shouldn’t be bestowed on just anyone. But you shouldn’t withhold trust due to bad experiences in the past, either. To know if someone is trustworthy, you should assess each situation individually, by judging the risk involved and the person’s credibility. If there’s a great deal at stake, maybe it shouldn’t be a job for someone with questionable trust. But if you genuinely believe the person is credible, competent and of good character, then that person is probably deserving of your trust. Some people have trouble with critical feedback. But the truth is, feedback is crucial to improvement. Let’s face it, no one’s perfect. Deep down, we know that there’s room for improvement, yet we don’t like to hear about our shortcomings from a colleague. When we receive feedback with suggestions on how to improve, we may feel many things, from mild displeasure to utter devastation. But that doesn’t mean you should shield yourself from feedback. Just consider the cautionary tale of Carsten. Carsten was a senior manager at a medical-equipment factory. He was bossy and refused to listen to anyone, even when the failure rate of the company’s medical parts began rising. According to his HR manager, Carsten believed that his stature as a top manager gave him immunity from feedback. He also thought that being open to feedback would make him look weak, so he built an environment where he couldn’t be reached. Without feedback, people usually don’t know how to improve. So it’s best to create a work environment where honest feedback is seen as safe and helpful, and gets delivered with good intentions. When employees feel as though the entire team is doing their best and everyone is eager to help each other improve, feedback begins to feel much less like a threat After all, if someone told you that you have toilet paper stuck to the bottom of your shoe, you’d thank him for saving you further embarrassment, right? Now, imagine if this same person, with the same helpful intentions, told you that you should try to improve your listening skills and be less assertive around others. Sure, personal feedback can sting, but it stings a lot less when you trust that it comes with good, sincerely helpful intentions. If you ever worked as a salesperson, you know that, sometimes, sales simply slow down. This sudden inactivity can quickly lead to frustration. But instead of letting such things get to you, you should shift gears and focus on inputs more than outputs. Outputs are another name for results, whether they’re sales or the numbers on a scorecard. Inputs, on the other hand, are the things you do to reach your desired results, like the time and effort you devote to practicing, researching or studying to get good grades. So, if the output has dried up or is unsatisfactory, why not devote some attention to the input? The first step is to know precisely the kind of output you want. If you run a hotel or some kind of service, you’re probably after customer satisfaction, for instance. The second step is to understand the current situation. Perhaps the latest feedback was good, but not as good as you’d hoped. Which leads to the final step of identifying how new or improved inputs could assist you in reaching your desired output and getting better customer ratings. If the customer feedback shows that people don’t like the booking or check-in procedures, then these would be the inputs that need to be fixed. From here, you could set up a meeting with the front-desk team to develop ways of improving the check-in experience. The relationship between you and your customers can certainly lead to learning about humility, and this is an important lesson because relationships and businesses both require humility in order to be successful. Part of being humble is remaining at peace with yourself and not feeling the need to receive someone else’s validation. A humble person isn’t controlled by her ego and she’ll therefore have no trouble encouraging the growth of others – and such humility naturally leads to strong, lasting relationships. Paige is another friend of the author and a leader in her organization. She’s not the kind of person who lacks strong ideas and great solutions, but she nevertheless is always eager to listen to what other people have to say before offering her own advice. This is humility in action, and, because of this, Paige is beloved by her colleagues. Everyone is well aware that Paige’s ability to build strong business relationships has been key to her company’s success. And it can be the key to your success as well! The key message in this book: Having good work relationships is important if we want to get better at what we do. Though it’s not necessarily easy, there are practices that’ll push you in the direction of building the relationships you need to succeed. These include staying open and flexible to new methods, taking time to think things over and not overreact, allowing others the room to do their work how they see fit, inspiring collaboration, listening to others and promoting a safe workplace where feedback isn’t avoided. Actionable advice: Ask for direct feedback. Alongside creating a work environment where people can give one another truthful and respectful feedback, it’s also a good idea to ask for feedback directly. It might be a bit uncomfortable to begin with, but, once you start doing it, others will be more willing to seek their own feedback and realize that it isn’t that bad – and that it can actually help them improve.

For people working as consultants, however, the ability to forge strong relationships is essential. In these blinks, we examine the importance of making oneself vulnerable in order to create a lasting working connection with clients. The blinks will also show you how to overcome the three fears that prevent many consultants from becoming truly vulnerable and open. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should never hide the fact you’re sweating; why “stupid questions” are rarely stupid; and why you shouldn’t be afraid of doing your client’s dirty work. Most people hesitate to let their defenses down, and nobody likes feeling vulnerable. But that discomfort runs contrary to human nature. In truth, the ability to feel vulnerable is essential to building deep and lasting relationships. Naturally, a commitment to relationships is key if you work with others, and it’s especially important for consultants. So what might that vulnerability look like in a work context? Take sweating as an example. People are taught never to let others see their perspiration, but that’s impossible. Worse still, when people notice that you’re sweating and trying to hide the fact, you lose credibility. That’s why, if you find yourself in a situation in which sweating is inevitable – say a meeting that’s stressful and hot – it’s best not to hide it. By being open about the fact, you’ll relieve others who will feel comfortable showing that they’re sweaty too. From then on, you’ll be treated like a member of the team, rather than an outsider trying to make a sale. This essential change will enable you to focus on your real job, which is to help, not to sell your opinion as a product. So, vulnerability is important, but it’s definitely not easy. After all, humans naturally fear appearing weak. However, that’s all the more reason to overcome the fear, because only by being undaunted by phobias can you embrace vulnerability. By learning how to stand “naked” in front of other people and bare your true, honest self, you’ll discover transparency, credibility and dedication. It sounds great, right? Well, next up you’ll learn how to overcome your fears and make that confidence a reality. As a consultant, it’s only natural to fear any loss of business. The problem is that you can’t show that fear. If you seem to care more about your own business than the needs of your clients, you’ll only exacerbate the issue. So, what’s a better approach? Tackle your fear of losing clients head on by putting their needs first. As you might have guessed, that’s going to mean getting vulnerable. It’ll be scary, but rest assured it’ll pay off in the end. For instance, you should never begin a relationship with a discussion of fees. It’s smarter to just do your job and present the value you offer. Such a humble and self-confident style will be sure to impress any client. And don’t worry, they won’t take advantage of you. When customers see you truly looking out for them, they’ll be happy to pay and won’t worry about micromanaging you. So as long as you focus on your consulting and the needs of your clients, you’ll have nothing to fear. But just to be safe, there are two other rules to follow. First, it’s important to be honest, yet kind with your clients. If they have a business idea that just doesn’t convince you, let them know, but respect their feelings. Recognize the work they’ve done and communicate how much you care. Second, keep in mind that it’s better to face danger than to put it off or ignore it. Just consider discussing a risky business move, like the introduction of a new product. There are always going to be people who only see the danger of such a choice. Often, these people are ignored, and the discussion continues as if they’d never opened their mouths. The problem here is a fear of confrontation. But if you can attend to the people who are afraid of launching a new product,you’ll please everybody with your ability to acknowledge reality and handle conflict. You need to overcome your fear if you want to be able to face risks! Imagine a scenario in which you have zero medical knowledge but are consulting for a hospital. Every third word you hear sounds like gibberish, and you don’t know what to do. Is it better to pretend you understand everything or to embarrass yourself by letting your ignorance show? Well, whatever you do, it’s essential to be prepared to ask dumb questions. After all, there will always be others in the room who don’t understand and, even in a hospital, not everybody knows every medical term. Not just that, but your questions might not be as dumb as you imagine. In fact, when all is said and done, your clients will forget the “stupid” questions you asked and remember the gems. Every question keeps the discussion going and is, therefore, valuable. So, you shouldn’t fear dumb questions, and the same goes for dumb suggestions. Feel free to shoot out ideas and celebrate the mistakes you make. Just like dumb questions, suggestions that you consider stupid likely aren’t stupid at all. Others are probably thinking about them too, and people will only remember the good suggestions you make. For example,  suggesting that a company work with a competitor that operates in a different market might sound insane, but it could also offer a great path toward growth. And finally, if your question or suggestion really is dumb, be comfortable celebrating the silliness. That means being OK with laughing at yourself. Just take the hypothetical scenario at the hospital. Maybe you forgot that it’s a non-profit. It’s definitely a dumb mistake, but you’ll earn the trust of the group by being able to acknowledge and celebrate it. You can apologize in a friendly way – say, by offering to get lunch for everyone. They’ll see that the issues they’re working to address are more important to you than saving face. Most people want to be considered important and to be treated as though they’re worth their salary. Therefore, it makes sense that you shouldn’t take on petty tasks like setting out chairs or picking up coffee, right? Well, actually, that fear of inferiority is a huge hindrance. It’s not like the simple fear of embarrassment because overcoming it doesn’t mean taking an intellectual risk. Instead, conquering this fear is about getting over your pride and your desire to be the center of attention. It’s also about being ready to take a figurative bullet for your client. Say your client poorly organized a conference and you need to interrupt every other speaker to keep things on schedule. You’ve got to fall on your sword and take responsibility for the hassle. Then, after the conference, you can tell your client the honest truth, which is that the conference wasn’t well organized. Rest assured that she’ll be grateful both for your honesty and for your loyalty. However, doing the dirty work goes beyond taking the blame; you also need to honor the work your client does. After all, if you fail to show enthusiasm and respect for your client’s work, you’ll never be able to muster the will to do the dirty work in the first place. For example, if you consider gambling and alcohol to be immoral, you’ll never be able to effectively consult for a casino or a bar. That means you should strictly avoid such clients as the outcome will always be poor. And finally, doing the dirty work is about downplaying your own role through an attitude of service. This is important since there will always be clients who need you to wait on them. If you can rise to the challenge, they’ll see how helpful you are. Rather than viewing you as inferior, they’ll see you as dedicated. Just keep in mind, you’re being paid to help. So, show your clients that you’ll do whatever needs to be done and build a relationship on a sturdy base of trust. The key message in this book: Vulnerability is not something to fear; it’s actually an incredible strength. While fear prevents us from making ourselves vulnerable, by overcoming such trepidations we can succeed like never before. It’s uncomfortable, but getting figuratively “naked” in front of others is well worth it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The fact is, in most workplaces, people have been conditioned to appreciate a person’s competencies over their values. And while a person’s skill set is important, no amount of marketing magic or workflow wizardry can make up for an average character. A people-first approach might sound fluffy, but it’s actually a savvy business decision. Placing values above competencies, investing long-term in human capital and compassionately mentoring your workforce creates a positive workplace culture, improves productivity and creates real value. But first we need a shared framework for defining goodness, living up to values grounded in goodness and resolving tensions when they arise. In these blinks, you’ll find out how Benjamin Franklin used to practice integrity; what a US airline can teach us about respect; and five key questions to ask if you’re a mentor. If you think about the word “good,” your mind probably grasps at various definitions and forms a stew of multiple associations. After all, does a “good” dog really have anything in common with a “good” idea? “Good” has become so overused that it’s lost any clear meaning – and things get even messier in the world of business. If you call your coworker “good,” are you referring to her well-balanced personality and core values or do you mean she’s competent at her job? Often it's the latter. In fact, an employee’s goodness is predominately measured by skills and competencies – not by their human nature, values and moral code. That’s partly because measuring someone’s goodness in competency is easy. From technical skills to academic accolades, goodness in competency has plenty of measurable markers to choose from. Think about your last job interview. Did any questions try to uncover your core values or conception of humanity? Chances are, the interview was based solely on things like your industry knowledge and spreadsheet skills. These are important, but goodness in values – instilled in employees and wider business culture – is even more crucial to corporate success. It’s a mistake to view the principal tenets of goodness – truth, compassion and wholeness – as “soft skills” that can be neglected. Workplaces that genuinely incorporate these values display happier, more productive workforces. These values cause positive change in the world and benefit the bottom line – there’s nothing “soft” about them! This makes sense, because stripping away a company’s margins and market share leaves nothing but a group of people determined to achieve a common goal. Financial health is contingent on the relationship between people, their values and the workplace’s culture. Why wouldn’t you want these things to radiate goodness? Just consider the WD-40 Company, a popular manufacturer of household products. It is uncompromising in its people-first philosophy. WD-40 views its staff as their top priority, and mentorship at the company is taken quite seriously: a WD-40 supervisor’s sole responsibility is her team’s well-being and success, and thanks to this, the approval ratings for superiors is regularly around 96 percent! The financial impact? Today, WD-40 is valued at over $1.5 billion, and staff turnover is three times lower than the national average. So, goodness should be distinguished from personal competencies or a business’ balance sheet. That’s all very well – but what is goodness, and how can we be good? There’s no easy answer, but adopting the Good People Mantra helps. This is a practical framework which guides our behavior and identifies goodness in others. It has five basic principles: First, be people-first. This means proactively placing human beings above ideas, targets and even profits. This is easier said than done. Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot argued that, given the choice, most people will choose a great idea over a great team. Why? Because most of us get excited about inspiration, not the disposition of our colleagues. Doriot believed this is a mistake – a great team can adapt, motivate team members and transform average ideas into stellar ones. People create ideas, but ideas don’t create people. Second, assist others in becoming better, fuller versions of themselves. Doing this requires patience, honesty and above all recognition of our shared humanity – understanding that we are all imperfect human beings. On this common ground, we can encourage people to realize their unique potential and help them blossom. Third, prioritize a person’s values over their competencies. This helps us better identify goodness in others. Industry experience might look good on paper, but core values and belief systems tell us more about future potential. Fourth, channel balance and pragmatism when practicing goodness. We live in an imperfect world full of competing priorities, between which tensions will inevitably arise. Navigating these tensions with a clear head is vital to keeping them from limiting what we can achieve. For example, the author stresses that in his organization, Zappos, he seeks a balance between idealistic and pragmatic employees. The former he values for their optimism and energy, while the latter are crucial for implementing ideas and strategies. Fifth, we need to consistently practice goodness. Too many people do so only when they’re being observed or see a clear advantage for themselves. But this runs counter to goodness’ core principles of truth, compassion and wholeness. Goodness requires that we consciously and consistently live up to our values, internalizing them until they become a core part of ourselves. In a way, the Good People Mantra fuels goodness. It’s clear, standardized principles keep the engine of goodness running. But an engine needs to power something, and the most effective vehicle for goodness comes in the shape of a pyramid. A three-tier framework, the Goodness Pyramid offers us a shared vocabulary about what goodness actually is. At its base is truth. Unless you are truthful to yourself and others, you won’t be able to act and think authentically and congruently. Without it, your foundation for goodness will be hollow. But truth is more complex than it seems. Truth itself is comprised of three core components: humility, self-awareness and integrity. Truth starts with humility. Being humble to those around you helps maintain a lifelong intellectual curiosity, and boosts your sense of humanity. And it’s also a key leadership trait. The media focuses on hard-nosed executives and no-nonsense CEOs, but leadership imbued with authentic humility inspires coworkers to be humble, down-to-earth and devoid of arrogance. That’s why Jim Collins, in his 2001 book Good to Great, described humility as the most essential trait in the world’s best business leaders. Next, truth is about self-awareness because this allows you to intelligently reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, ultimately becoming truthful with yourself. But self-awareness is also a skill – and one that can be strengthened in many ways. Writing, meditation, psychometric tests and seeking out feedback from peers are all activities which, when undertaken with an open mind, increase our capacity for reflection and self-awareness. Truth’s third element is integrity, because this trait ensures a truthful coherence between your professed values and actual behavior. A great exercise for measuring integrity comes from Benjamin Franklin. Each week, Franklin would draw out a simple table, writing the days of the week along the top and the values he strived to live up to along the left-hand side. Every day he would judge if he’d lived up to his professed values, and if he had he would tick the corresponding box. This is a simple but highly effective way of practicing goodness and ensuring integrity. Consider a world where everything revolves around truth. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Well, yes and no. Sometimes the truth can be cold, hard or even brutal. Sometimes, as the old saying goes, the truth hurts. That’s why truth isn’t the aim of goodness – it’s merely the starting point. To truly define goodness, we need to look to the center of the Goodness Pyramid – compassion. Compassion is an exercise in complete selflessness. It looks outside the self and allows us to perceive the feelings and experiences of others more clearly. Despite that, it can be difficult to see a place for compassion in the cutthroat world of business. That’s because in traditional business settings, we've been conditioned to equate compassion with weakness and ruthlessness with professionalism. That’s why hiring practices are often guided by the mottos “weed out the bottom” and “hire slow, fire fast.” But practicing compassion is crucial in building a unique, inspiring and productive workplace. In fact, it helps catalyze performance and motivates teams to nail important deadlines and organizational objectives because they can clearly see how the team’s success impacts those around them. Compassion has three anchoring values: openness, empathy and generosity. Firstly, openness is a state of mind which counters negative biases, allowing optimism to seep through like light through the cracks and making it easier to feel compassion. One good way to practice openness is by following the 24x3 rule. Designed to prevent hasty judgements, it imposes a minimum wait time of 24 seconds, 24 minutes or 24 hours before responding to a colleague’s idea. In this time, you explore all the possible advantages of the idea before delivering your verdict. Empathy is the attempt to understand another’s feelings. Good people possess high levels of empathy, allowing them to effect positive change in the workplace by better connecting with their coworkers and feeling compassion for them. And the best way to practice empathy is by asking genuine questions. From simple things like “How are you, really?” to heart-to-heart inquiries like “Are you happy working here?” Finally, generosity is the last anchor of compassion. Generosity benefits the giver and the receiver, making it key to bridging the age-old divide between compassion and competition. For example, author and professor Adam Grant observed in his bestseller Give and Take that the most collaborative, generous students in American medical schools tended to fare more successfully in their future careers. Maybe you’ve heard the saying “life is a marathon, not a sprint.” If it rings a bit hollow, maybe this is because it assumes that everyone measures their life against a neatly defined objective. Replace “life” with “wholeness”, on the other hand, and the saying makes a lot more sense! Wholeness is both the highest point on the Goodness Pyramid and the hardest to achieve. Wholeness is a state of being, and it comprises three elements: love, respect and wisdom. But it’s the search for wholeness – a search which never truly ends – that is important. The search for wholeness is the highest expression of someone’s goodness. Love might sound strange in a business context, but it’s not about developing romantic attachments to your coworkers! Instead, it’s about caring deeply for others’ well-being and happiness. And it also means possessing a love for your company’s brand and values – in short, loving what you do. In his book, Lovemarks, former chairman of advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi Kevin Roberts argues that love and respect should become central pillars of the brand-consumer relationship. Brands, therefore, should ignore “trademarks” and instead create “lovemarks” – memorable moments that leave authentic imprints on consumers. Beyond that, wholeness is characterized by respect – both for yourself and for others. Consider how US airline JetBlue reacted to the disastrous fallout from delays caused by an ice storm on Valentine’s Day 2007. With public opinion of the airline plummeting, JetBlue CEO David Neeleman issued a public apology full of respect and empathy for how customers had been affected. Neeleman took full responsibility and explained how JetBlue would prevent the delays from happening again. Using the old-school approach of “the customer is always right,” he put respect for the consumer front and center. The final trait of wholeness, wisdom, puts intelligence and experience into practice. It helps distinguish important things from unimportant, enabling us to make better choices. In a business context, this could mean knowing the difference between a fad and a trend that’s here to stay. True wisdom is more than this though. It also allows us to distinguish between factors we can and can’t control and prevents us from dwelling on the latter. It helps us make more accurate assessments, and better appreciate complexity, so that we can see life as black, white and a thousand shades of grey. This ability to read situations clearly is especially important when we face the tensions of the real world, as we’ll see in the next blink. Do you remember how, as a kid, your paper plane never flew as perfectly as you’d have liked? Well, the same can happen when you practice goodness in an imperfect, contradictory world. Designing a shared framework for goodness is one thing, but implementing it in the real world is quite another. We’re always going to encounter tensions at work – even when we try to implement goodness. And these can often act as roadblocks to our good intentions, forcing important trade-offs. One tension is between short-term and long-term thinking. Though most of us understand the importance of planning for the future, our decision-making still tends toward short-term rewards. But why is this? Well, it’s partly because of Amara’s law, which says that we overestimate short-term effects and underestimate long-term effects. Just look at the culture of instant gratification we’ve built in business; public company CEOs struggle to improve their short-term gains every quarter, and investors typically make trades with the hope of selling at a profit in a few years’ time. But building anything meaningful takes patience and skillful navigation of the tension between long-termism and short-termism. We have to be particularly vigilant, of course, about our bias towards the latter! One shining example of this vigilance is prolific investor Warren Buffett, whose successful long-termism is the stuff of legend. In 1999, Buffett received a torrent of negative press for not investing in the then-ballooning dot-com bubble. Critics slated him, labeling him old-fashioned, conservative and behind the times. Instead of responding, Buffett quietly exercised patience, having the integrity to stick with his long-term growth strategy over making a quick buck. In March 2000, when the dot-com bubble began to burst in dramatic fashion, Buffett’s strategy was vindicated. And this thinking applies to people, too. By mentoring colleagues – both personally and professionally – we tease out their full potential, transforming them into strong individuals who add real value to our company in the form of human capital. We can do this by generously sharing our specialist knowledge and skills, providing honest but kind feedback and instilling individuals with a powerful sense that they can realize any objective they wish to. So, tensions inevitably arise between goodness and an imperfect world – but how should we act when they do? Well, there’s a four-step decision-making process we can use to untangle our reasoning and make sense of difficult, complex situations. It’s called the R.I.S.E framework. To use it, begin by recognizing a situation. This means evaluating its risks and potential outcomes, and also having the wisdom to set realistic expectations for these. We should not waste energy dreaming up perfect but impossible solutions. When Singapore won its independence from Malaysia in 1965, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew recognized that improving Singapore’s port infrastructure was vital for the nation’s economy. But he also realized the challenges this would pose to locals through the transformation of their communities as immigrants would pour in– a clear tension between idealism and pragmatism. By recognizing the situation early on Lee was able to navigate this tension successfully. For example, he established the Central Provident Fund: a statewide pension plan and corporation that enabled citizens to feel ownership of their country. The next step in R.I.S.E is to internalize the situation before we act. This goes past recognition, and the goal is to deeply understand the issue at hand and mentally explore all potential outcomes. And internalizing a situation works especially well in the world of investment. For example, when Anthony Tjan co-founded MiniLuxe, a nail care services company, he was in no rush to get going. Even after an accepted business plan, all partners spent a huge amount of time internalizing the concept in minute detail. This patience paid off: today MiniLuxe is over ten years old and impacts hundreds of thousands of people, from shareholders and employees to suppliers and customers. Third, it’s crucial we share our reflections on a situation with a select group of good people, whether it's mentors, coworkers or family. Doing so gives us the benefit of multiple perspectives – perspectives which might contribute a different, previously unexplored angle on the issue at hand. Finally, it’s time to execute. The essential factor here is to have the conviction that the decision is the right one. A great way to boost our conviction – and bring in elements of self-awareness – is to turn to pen and paper. Once we’ve made our decision we should write it down, along with why we made this choice and our logical reasoning behind it. In the future, this will aid us in the process of learning by reflecting on previous decisions and instigating a positive feedback loop. Striving for goodness is important for all businesspeople. But when we’re in positions of leadership and authority, it becomes absolutely imperative. Once we possess a high level of responsibility and the power to influence the lives of people we lead, the Good People Mantra stipulates that we must attempt to inspire, motivate and help them realize their full potential as human beings. And by incorporating goodness into our daily practices, we supercharge our abilities to mentor and become inspirational leaders. This starts with a key distinction between mentoring for training and mentoring for goodness. Just as most of us tend to recognize competencies over values, most mentor-mentee relationships tend to neglect the teaching and pursuit of goodness in favor of measurable business skills. These are important, but the mentoring relationship should first focus on authentic connection between partners and establishing a common set of values. Doing so renders mentoring for training both more enjoyable and effective. So, we need to authentically connect with our mentee before we drill down into technicalities. But what’s a concrete way of using goodness to become a better mentor? Well, we should exercise our compassion and empathy to become better listeners. This sounds counterintuitive, because it feels like the mentee should be doing all the talking. But it makes a great deal of sense: genuinely listening and being receptive to our mentees enhances our understanding of the relationship, deepens trust and sparks inspiration. When asking questions, it’s crucial to avoid what author Margo Feiden calls “phatic communication.” Phatic communications, Feiden argues, are everyday words and phrases which are convenient, meaningless and entirely procedural: think “how are you?” or “if you don’t mind …” These should be avoided, in mentorship and also in life, as they’re devoid of compassion. We don’t truly listen to the answers, and eliminating them is a sure-fire way of becoming a more compassionate and empathetic listener. Here are five critical questions that good mentors should ask mentees: What are you truly trying to achieve? What are you doing well that is helping you get there? What is slowing you down? What will you change tomorrow to help you get there faster? How can I help? These questions are important because they strike an important balance between discovering the truth and offering compassion. What’s more, they do so authentically, without phatic communication. Overall, when we live according to the Good People Mantra, strive towards the Goodness Pyramid’s values of truth, compassion and wisdom and recognize tensions as they arise, we can supercharge our work environment, foster goodness in others and become good people ourselves. The key message in these blinks: We’ve been conditioned by corporate culture to value a person’s competencies over their values, but in truth, the latter are far more important. Skills are more easily measured, but a person’s character is what adds meaningful, long-lasting value to a company and its culture. We need a new framework for defining goodness and guiding our actions and another for dealing with tensions which inevitably arise when we practice goodness in the real world. Practicing goodness can make us better employees, mentors and human beings, but also benefits the bottom line. Actionable advice: Practice phatic abstinence  Phatic communication, you will remember, refers to the phrases in our language which have become so routine they’ve lost their meaning. To build up your empathetic reasoning and listening skills, try to go a whole day without communicating in phatic language.

Culbert","summary":"In general, work conditions in the United States may be better now than they were 30 years ago, but how does the quality of management in your place of employment stack up? Are you unable to challenge the ideas of those higher up on the corporate ladder? Do you sometimes feel like your needs in the workplace aren’t being met? Do you find yourself asking your coworkers about their weekend, even if you don’t really care what they have to say? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. In fact, this kind of negative workplace culture is common in businesses around the United States. Workplace culture, along with other factors, teaches managers the wrong habits, and once poor management techniques become habitual, they can become difficult to do away with. But there’s good news. With the tools and guidance provided in these blinks, you’ll learn how to overcome this toxic culture, be a good manager and a good person. In these blinks, you’ll learn the importance of using the first-person pronoun in business discussions; why managers are taught to be deceitful and inauthentic; and how to change negative workplace culture. People around the world admire the work culture in the United States. American businesses are perceived as successful and innovative, so couldn’t you assume that these companies have flexible, kind, talented and effective managers? Sadly, this is not the case. In reality, bad management is the rule, not the exception. Annual polling by US research company Gallup finds that four out of five people in management don’t have the talent to manage effectively. While there are many exceptions, particularly in start-ups and small businesses, the prevailing experience of employees in most companies and organizations includes bad management. Interestingly enough, results of an academic study showed that the most useful thing a manager can do to help employees is simply leave them alone when they are working productively, rather than offer misguided help. Additionally, bad management is so entrenched in our work culture that people expect it, shrug it off or don’t even notice it. Just consider the actions of Carly Fiorina, one of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates. In 2006, when she was CEO of Hewlett Packard, Fiorina secretly eavesdropped on the IT company’s board of directors. For this, she was fired. Nonetheless, she was invited to join the board of the telecommunications company AT&T, and, when she ran for US Senate in 2010, she won the votes of more than four million Californians. So, despite her poor management, people were able to forgive or ignore her misbehavior in the context of workplace culture. But bad management must not be ignored; it should come under heavier scrutiny. Think of how much more profitable businesses could be, and how high the level of employee satisfaction could rise, if bad management weren’t so commonplace. To find out why it’s become so common, let’s move on to the next blink. We admire those who fight their way to the top, battling difficult circumstances or overcoming great hurdles. It’s the stuff American dreams are made of. And so maybe it’s not so surprising that the business world is all but defined by self-focus. In other words, when it comes to business, managers focus solely on their own success, not the success of those who report to them. Those in management may not admit it, or even realize it, but they’re usually self-focused,even if they really do have good intentions. Too many managers have a Boy-Scout mentality – they’re so concentrated on performing “good deeds,” the managerial equivalent of helping an old lady cross the road, that they fail to notice the needs of others. The problem, though, is that the Boy Scout, by focusing too much on being helpful, can fail to realize that he’s not meeting the needs of the person he claims to be helping. More often than not, the old lady didn’t even want to cross the road! Good managers, on the other hand, eschew self-focus in favor of other-focus. It’s a little like parenting. Parents want the best for their children. They help their kids find enjoyable activities, and then assist them in pursuing their interests. Similarly, good managers ask questions, understand others’ needs and create the necessary conditions for their employees to achieve success, all while maintaining a two-way relationship. Most managers understand the importance of this relationship. For instance, when asked about their experience of being managed, most managers complain about not getting the attention and support that they need from their managers. Managers also want to hear “What do you need?” – not “I need this from you!” – from their supervisors. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be how American business culture operates. The American dream doesn’t encourage managers to prioritize the success of others over their own. But there’s more to it than just the American dream’s reinforcement of this type of culture in the workplace. Let’s press on to see what other factors contribute to poor management. In business schools across the United States, people skills are referred to as soft skills – and these are thought to be inferior to the hard skills that enable one to boost the bottom line and increase profits. The problem is, this preference for hard skills has a detrimental effect on management. Here’s just one example of how business schools fail to teach MBA graduates about being a good manager. Business schools may teach their students about interpersonal skills, such as active listening. But how many are teaching real reflection, like, for example, reflecting on how your personal background impacts your worldview and your interactions with others at work? This kind of introspection is crucial when working with alternative mind-sets, but it’s a skill that is rarely taught. And then, after graduation, business students enter the workplace, which breeds conformity, not honesty. Over time, people learn that not rocking the boat, and avoiding any expression of frustration, is the way to get by in the workplace. To climb up the corporate ladder to positions such as senior manager, or executive of the board, you need to stay in line. For example, in 2014, the new CEO of the Los Angeles Times announced a new holiday policy. Employees of the company no longer had a set number of vacation days. Instead, they had to ask for time off, and if the manager could spare some staff, they were allowed to go. Of course, this angered the employees, who feared that the managers suddenly had extra power over them. Because of this, they were too afraid to speak out. On the other hand, the managers themselves feared the pressure from their managers, and hesitated to sign off on too many vacation days. They, too, were afraid of stepping out of line. This left everyone unhappy. The new CEO might’ve made a better decision had he taken the perspective of his employees, or if more managers had felt free to speak out against the bad idea. So the need to survive in America’s tough workplace culture can drive and enable bad managerial decisions. But that’s not all. In the next blink, we’ll look at how far those bad behaviors can go. Have you ever lied to your boss? Now think carefully: has your boss ever lied to you? Deceit is a core management characteristic; huge amounts of time and energy are devoted to it. Disagree? Consider the following behaviors: being friendly with someone you don’t like, participating in a meeting that’s a waste of time, staying quiet on a controversial issue, getting someone else to deliver bad news, exaggerating your role in the success of a project, preparing an excuse in case you’re questioned. Have you ever witnessed, or done, any of these things? We all engage in these routine behaviors because of a workplace culture that breeds pretense, frowns on dissent and expects perfection from imperfect humans. Managers pick up these deceitful habits, too, which prevent them from focusing on their employees’ needs. First, managers make a show of it when consulting colleagues for guidance on a new course of action. They ask for opinions, appear engaged, nod their head to show that they understand. More often than not, however, their mind is already made up. Commitments have been made, and there is no going back. Then, managers will often invoke the voice of a powerful authority to get their own way. This is known as borrowed authority. They might say something like, “I’ve talked with Ted, and this is how he thinks we should do it.” Ted could be the CEO or a respected management consultant – anyone, really, in an authoritative position. Invoking an authority figure simply enables managers to get what they want without having to make any arguments themselves. This constant need to self-promote and self-protect is exhausting. Small wonder, then, that managers have trouble paying attention and keeping up with the needs of their employees. We all know there’s inequality in the workplace. So why does it still exist? Because culture is hard to shift. It’s the same with bad management. Bad management is hard to shake because there are structural incentives to keep it in place. Most managers are confident that they know what is needed in order to get results. They believe that simply telling their employees what to do is quicker and easier than taking the time to understand, guide and support them. And, at least in the short term, it is quicker. Meanwhile, it’s hard for employees to force change on their manager. Let’s say you’re unhappy with your manager. You’re overworked and feel like you’re not getting the right support. At the same time, you know there is a promotion opportunity coming up, and that your manager will have a say in who gets it. Most likely, you’ll keep quiet, fully aware that this isn’t the best time to be bringing up his poor management skills. Too often, change can’t be incited from the bottom. And so it has to come from the top. As a business consultant, the author set out to change the mentality of a global 150,000-employee corporation in a program driven by a committed CEO. When presenting his ideas on how to change the company’s business mentality to the HR team, he received a non-committal, “Okay, we will take it into account.” It was only with the active and invigorated support of the CEO and other leaders that new management systems could be introduced. In other words, to bring about change, you need a CEO or other very high-ranking member of the company who sees the benefits of your idea. Leadership is essential, but there remains one key change that needs to happen before better management can be achieved. Let’s check that out next. When managers are used to being self-focused and directive with their employees, it can be hard to know how to change. So here are some concrete ways that managers can become other-focused. First, replace performance reviews with two-way conversations. Performance reviews, though ostensibly objective, tend to be extremely biased, not to mention damaging. Not only does a single manager’s personal opinion get recorded as a factual report on your abilities and imperfections; the one-sided, hierarchical nature of reviews also intimidates employees into remaining silent about management problems. A two-way conversation, however, like the one the author developed during his work with a major global corporation, opens up a dialogue and eradicates employees’ fears of speaking up. The author’s two-way conversation system centers around four questions: What has your contribution to the company been? How has your work reflected our company’s values and goals? How have you helped other people to succeed? How have you changed your behavior, based on what you’ve learned? The second method to lessen the self-focus of managers is to introduce two-way accountability. Taking the concept of two-way conversations one step further, two-way accountability has both the manager and the employee answer these four questions. A coin is flipped to see who goes first. That person then answers the four questions while the other listens and takes notes. After that’s done, they swap roles, so that, in the end, both manager and employee give feedback on their own performance. Instantly, the two-way approach breaks down hierarchies and frees both parties to be a little more honest. Unlike the traditional, one-way performance review, both parties get feedback, allowing them to reach an honest conclusion about how to improve. Two-way accountability is a big shift away from the traditional way of doing things. But the impact of an honest exchange on personal relationships and business productivity makes it completely worthwhile. To better manage employees, leaders should replace the core cultural expectations that drive bad management with a new mind-set. Our desire for immediate results, our expectations of perfection and our association of punishment with accountability are just a few of the workplace’s unhelpful cultural expectations. We expect excellence even though humans are not excellent by nature. For example, employees are expected to say, “I don’t know, I need some help with this.” But too often, the workplace environment doesn’t really allow people to admit imperfection or weakness. To allow for improvement, we need to actively encourage people to say, “I don’t know,” when that’s the case. Furthermore, managers should seek feedback. As an example, let’s take a look at the American company Home Depot. The company assigned members of the board to walk down a number of store aisles each quarter, allowing them the chance to chat with employees, who, in turn, were encouraged to provide honest opinions. Because the talks were explicitly confidential, managers were able to discover that there was deep unrest about pay and the lack of opportunity for female employees. The search for useful feedback paid off: when they were hit with a gender discrimination lawsuit, the company saw it coming and had already taken steps to improve the situation. To become a good manager, one should also prioritize honesty. The author teaches leaders and managers about the importance of honesty by insisting that they use the first-person pronoun. So, for example, in a meeting, rather than saying, “We need to do this,” try, “Let me tell you how I see it….” This allows the other person freedom to say, “I see that a different way.” And if they don’t respond, you could always try asking, “Do you see it differently?” Using the first-person pronoun encourages honesty and can transform relationships. Managers become better when they genuinely listen to and understand the thoughts of their employees and coworkers. A bigger emphasis on honesty and authenticity will allow managers to spot any problems immediately, and, as a result, cultivate a happier workplace. The key message in this book: Most managers mean well, but they are often distracted by their need to succeed and the pressures that come with that. Thus, they fail to fulfill their responsibilities to support the people they manage. Good management requires other-focus – that is, seeking to understand and support the needs of others, rather than focusing on yourself. Implementing an other-focus management system will result in happier and more productive employees, which is the surest path to a more successful business. Actionable advice: Point out bad management behavior when you see it. The first step toward change is raising awareness of the failings and limitations of current management behavior. You now know the warning signs: self-focus, inauthenticity and management that is directive rather than supportive and other-focused. Exchange your observations with your peers. Their experiences will help enrich your understanding of the problem and help you articulate your case. Keep this conversation going and you can start to build the buzz that might just prompt your leaders to start making positive change. Got feedback?

And yet, you’re likely to find very few books on how to actually hire and put together a great team. Recruiting is still largely a hit-and-miss affair, but it doesn’t have to be. There is a science to recruiting the best people; if you learn it, you can improve your staff decisions exponentially, resulting in incalculable upsides for your company. So what exactly should you do? These blinks, based on the knowledge of one of the world’s leading recruitment consultants, provide you with the essential tools you need to start making great hiring decisions. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the dead hand of procrastination can leave us with a poorly functioning team; why, even if your team seems perfect, you shouldn’t stop thinking about making changes; and why the best way to find a top candidate is to ask someone else. There are plenty of books out there that promise to reveal the secrets to business success. But although they might offer plenty of sound advice, they often miss one of the most important factors on your journey to success: other people. Books boasting the best business secrets don’t teach you how to make great people decisions, that is, how to find great people and put them in the right places. While there are, of course, many factors that will determine your career successes, being adept at people decisions is critical. It’s certainly true that genes, education, career choices and personality, among other factors, play an important role in boosting some people toward success and leaving others behind. However, people decisions are just as important as these other factors, and perhaps even more so.  First, as your career progresses, you will be more likely to move into roles that require you to manage more and more people. Naturally, being highly skilled at finding the right people for the right positions is essential. Second, you can never do your best work alone. According to career expert Marcus Buckingham, no one has unlimited potential. If you want to keep developing and succeeding, you’ll need the help of others who can complement your skills and help you move forward.      Unfortunately, despite the great importance of people decisions, many of us fail to develop this valuable skill. This is in part because people tend to think that the ability to judge people is based on “gut” feelings and intuition – it’s not something that can be learned, but something you either have or don’t.  But this simply isn’t true. The ability to make great people decisions – to judge whether someone is good at a particular job or in your team – is one that can, and indeed must, be learned. How exactly? That will come a little later; the next step is to look at the benefits that great people decisions bring to organizations. Image you’re an anaesthetist who only manages to revive your patients 33 percent of the time. Would you be considered a success? Of course not. In fact, you’d be arrested for such serious malpractice! Incredibly, according to the father of business excellence, Peter Drucker, when it comes to making effective people decisions, executives only get it right 33 percent of the time. This is a shocking statistic, especially considering that there is essentially no factor more important for a company's success than putting the best performing people in the right roles. When people think of the factors that lead to success or failure in business, they often think of the need to find business ventures, partnerships and markets, responding to competition, knowing when to acquire and merge, and so on. Yet, competence in any of these areas requires a different set of skills that no one is likely to have. So, if a company wants to master each of these business areas, it needs to have the right teams in place. This view is supported by the work of prominent business expert Jim Collins, who rates hiring the right team as the most important thing any company can do. He argues that until an organization has filled 90 percent of its roles with the right people, doing so should remain its highest priority. As important as great people decisions are for a company today, these decisions will only become more important in the future. Indeed, in the fastest-growing areas of the economy (biotech, media, entertainment and software), the quality of staff is far more important than an organization’s physical assets. For example, it’s not powerful equipment that creates quality software, but great programmers. It’s thus important for companies and managers to refine their skills related to people decisions today, as their success tomorrow could depend on it! We now know that hiring the best people and putting them in the right places will go a long way in advancing both your career and your company. And yet, so many of us fail to make great people decisions. Why?  There are four main reasons for this trend; in this blink, we’ll focus on the first two. The first reason is the most obvious: there are just not that many exceptional candidates out there. There are, however, plenty of “average” people who could perform a given job more or less competently. As a matter of statistics, you’re more likely to end up hiring one of them, rather than one of the relatively few high-performing candidates. Second, correctly assessing which people will work for which role isn’t always as straightforward as we would like to think, and there are a number of reasons why this is the case. For one, although it might be easy to assess which candidates have the correct “hard” skills for a role, it is not easy to judge their soft skills. For example, many roles (especially managerial roles) require skills that are hard to pick out on a CV. If a candidate will have to know how to manage conflicts within their team to be successful in the role, what information on their resume would help you judge their ability to act as a negotiator or conciliator? Additionally, you might hire the perfect candidate for the current role only to see the role change over time, causing this perfect candidate to suddenly appear less than perfect. Imagine you’re a start-up and decide to hire a CEO who is an expert in scaling and growing businesses. But what happens when your market gets a new competitor and your business starts to decline? Suddenly you need a CEO who is innovative and can outthink your rivals, not just someone who is good with growth. Your current CEO just wouldn’t fit the bill anymore. Would you consider yourself a rational person? Probably. In fact, most of us think that we make decisions by carefully (and rationally) weighing the choices available to us. But this simply isn’t the case. Our minds are far from perfect, rational computation machines, and we’re prone to psychological biases that affect the way we think and make decisions. This is no less the case when it comes to people decisions. Two of the most common biases are procrastination and herding. We all tend to procrastinate, that is, leaving things alone until they absolutely must be changed. When it comes to people decisions, we most often see procrastination in practice when we know that we need to let a failing employee go, but don’t. Instead, we put off making the difficult choice until even more damage has been done. Herding is also fairly straightforward: while we might think we act individually, we actually feel most comfortable following the herd. So, when we’re deciding who to hire for a role, we defer to the majority verdict, even if we think that verdict is incorrect. A final factor that prevents us from making great people decisions are candidates’ and recruiters’ motivations. On the one hand, candidates can sometimes be desperate for a job or an opportunity to move up the career ladder. Depending on their individual circumstances, many feel they need the job, and this can cause them to exaggerate or lie to get it. In fact, one poll even found that 95 percent of college-age people would, by their own admission, lie to get a job! On the other hand, recruiters have their own incentives. Hiring isn’t always fair; nepotism, favors and hubris can become real problems in the hiring process. As a result, companies are sometimes left with employees who simply aren’t suited to their respective roles. If you want to start making great people decisions, the first thing you need to learn is how to identify when it’s time to make a change. We often make critical decisions at the very last possible moment. As you’ve learned, procrastination is among the psychological biases that keep us from making the best people decisions. Unfortunately, in the modern world, procrastination can be disastrous. For instance, while we wait for a failing manager to turn things around, the market can run away from us before our very eyes. This situation has to be be avoided. As soon as it becomes clear that change is needed – for whatever reason – companies have to make a move. If this means letting people go, so be it; don’t try to avoid the unpopular decisions, just be honest and take action.  But in order to identify the situations where changes are necessary, managers need to get in the habit of evaluating their teams, both in terms of what is needed now, and what will be necessary in the future.  The first step in identifying these situations is to analyze your team’s competencies. Do you have strong performers? Managers with great potential? Are the people who will succeed your executive team already on your staff? If you answered “no” to any of these questions, it’s time to think about making changes. It’s also important to remember that just because your team is doing well now, that won’t necessarily be the case in the future. It’s important to keep an eye on your future needs when making people decisions. For example, the team that has been working miracles during a serious market downturn might not be the right team for your company once you’ve made it through to the other side. Now that you have a firm understanding of when to implement change, the following blinks will concentrate on who you should be looking for.  Once you’ve recognized that change is necessary, it’s time to start making great people decisions. But where should you begin? It all starts with knowing what to look for. When building your team, you aren’t looking for the “perfect employee,” as they almost certainly don’t exist. Rather, your job is to ensure that your employees have the right combination of skills. You’ll have to take many things into consideration when hiring to fill a role, such as an applicant’s IQ, experience, potential and strength in the core competencies necessary to perform their job functions well.  But there is also emotional intelligence (EI), which refers to a person’s ability to manage both their own and others’ emotions.  Try as you might, it’s unlikely that you’ll find a candidate who excels in all of these areas. You will undoubtedly have to make trade-offs. So which skills should you prioritize? No matter what role you’re hiring for, you’ll want to ensure that the candidate who gets the job has high levels of EI. Whatever other strengths they may have as a candidate, without EI they will probably fail in the long run. IQ is also universally important, but it shouldn’t be weighted as strongly as EI. The next considerations involve the role itself. If you’re trying to find someone for lower management or for a non-management position, then you should be looking for high levels of potential measured by candidates’ ambition and their ability to learn as they go. If, however, you’re recruiting someone for an executive role, experience becomes more important than potential. Likewise, it’s extremely important that you clearly define which competencies candidates will need before you start recruiting. Make sure you have the discipline to carefully analyze what you need instead of hiring on the fly! When it comes time to fill a role, most companies post an application online and wait for people to apply. Simple, yes – but also ineffective. This method only allows you to reach the people who are looking for a job and using that particular site to find one. As a result, many potential candidates get left out. So what should you do instead? One way is to develop a shortlist of the best candidates using a technique called sourcing. Sourcing consists of asking people (usually other executives, managers, consultants, and so on) whether they can recommend anyone who would be suited to the role you need to fill. This method takes advantage of the networks and connections already in place in the professional world.  You’ve probably heard of the phrase “six degrees of separation,” referring to the idea that we’re all connected to one another by a maximum of just six links of friendship. So, if you ask the right people, the right candidate won’t be far away. By the same token, it’s also important to consider that the best candidates don’t always come from the outside. Be sure to include candidates who are already part of the company on your shortlist.   But how many people should you put on your shortlist? The ideal number depends on the job, but there are nonetheless some ballpark figures to consider. In general, you need roughly 20 people to pick from to ensure you find a good match. Since narrowing down to just 20 candidates can be tough, use benchmarking to help prune your list. To do this, create a profile of your ideal candidate for the role and then judge each candidate based on their likeness to this profile. This lets you quickly and easily weed out those who clearly wouldn’t make a good fit. Using this very technique, one US company that was recruiting a new manager for their Asian market managed to cut down a shortlist of 100 top candidates to just 12 of the very, very best.  How many job interviews have you attended in your life? How did they go? Were the questions relevant, or did they seem bizarre? And what about the interviewer: did he or she tend to ramble?  You probably answered “yes” to at least one of these questions. In fact, most job interviews are not particularly effective; they are largely unstructured, and the questions don’t elicit information that is actually valuable.  So don’t make the same mistake! Instead, plan your interviews carefully using thoughtfully selected questions. The first step in conducting a productive interview is to clearly define the core competencies of the role for which you are hiring. What are the most important characteristics that define the ideal candidate? Does she need to be results focused? Is strategic thinking essential? Should she have strong interpersonal skills? You then need to ask interview questions that will help you judge a candidate's strength in each of these competencies. The best way to do this is by asking behavioral questions, that is, questions that require the candidate to explain how she has handled past situations. If you want to learn about a candidate’s team leadership competence, for example, you can ask her to describe times when she has made her team more effective, or has helped them achieve a goal.  However, making judgments in an interview is difficult, and asking the right questions isn’t worth much if you can’t glean any good information from the answers. As you’ve learned, human beings are notoriously bad at making judgments, and further compounding the problem is that fact that we also tend to make snap judgments. If someone talks in a loud, confident voice in an interview, you may be impressed by their apparent authority without realizing that what they’ve said is actually completely vapid. It’s important to enlist professional experts who can adequately train you, and whoever else will be hiring, in order for you to become incisive when judging people and their expressions. If you follow all the advice presented thus far, you will be well on your way to finding the best candidate for the job. But there’s still one factor left to consider: what if they don’t want to join? Recruiting is a two-way affair: you want to hire the best person for the job, and they have to want to work for you. If either of these is missing, it’s “no deal.” In order to win over the best candidates, you have to make your business attractive for high-caliber employees. Most obviously, if you want good people, you’re going to have to pay them a good wage. Even if you think you’re the best company to work for, if the compensation isn’t there, the best candidates simply won’t be interested. Next, you have to sell your company to them by demonstrating your passion. Tell them why the job you’re considering them for is so great. Maybe your company is helping make the world a better place, or maybe the company’s success means the candidate would really be going places.  Also, go the extra mile to show them how much you want them on your side. As an example, the author even travelled to another continent in order to convince a candidate to join his team – that’s real dedication! Once a deal is finalized, you should do everything you can to integrate new hires. New personnel often face a steep learning curve, and without help and support, the probability of failure is high. So look after them carefully, teach them all they need to know about the job (even before getting started) and support them in their early days with the company. If they fail to integrate, then be honest with yourself and the candidate. Recognize that you’ve made an incorrect people decision and pull the plug. The key message in this book: Plenty of factors influence a company’s performance. Despite often being overlooked, people decisions actually have the greatest impact of all on a company’s success. By placing a high priority on the decisions you make regarding personnel, you can better position yourself for success – regardless of your company’s stage of development.  Actionable advice: Always check references. Passion for the job isn’t the only thing that motivates interview candidates. Money, prestige and career desperation can all play a role in how badly someone wants the job. As a result, people will sometimes say anything to get a job, which means that a great interview performance doesn’t necessarily make a great candidate. Thus, before you carry through with an offer, always check the candidate’s references to make sure they are as experienced and competent as they say they are.

In fact, the invention of agriculture – gardening on a major scale – helped create the first civilizations, so the practice of cultivating plants has long been an integral part of our culture. Yet, the skills and know-how we use in growing flowers, vegetables and trees can, with equal effectiveness, be used to grow employees. By following the rules of gardening, you can turn a weak and delicate sapling of an employee into a worker of tree-like strength and sturdiness, someone who provides your business with stability and a fruitful harvest. Sound bizarre? Well, these blinks will show you that great employees can be grown, and that any business can do it. In these blinks, you’ll discover how to stop employees from lying in interviews; how to foster a positive environment; and why even the best managers must sometimes prune away imperfect employees. In a perfect world, employees would be perfect. They would perform tasks correctly, present outstanding ideas and ascend seamlessly from entry-level positions to top managerial spots. But the world is not perfect and employees are, like everyone, merely flawed human beings with a touch of potential. Like plants in a garden, employees need careful, consistent attention. If they aren’t cared for, they’ll wilt. So cultivating employees is like tending to a garden. It takes time, consideration, skill and knowledge. And if you learn how to cultivate your employees in the right way, you can help them to thrive. Environment is the perfect place to begin. Just as you can’t grow a cactus on a snowy mountaintop, you can’t expect a chatty, arty employee who is used to a flexible schedule to thrive and bloom in a silent payroll department that works strictly 9 to 5. She won’t be an effective team member in this environment. Even if you have the best intentions and outstanding people-management skills, it simply won’t work. These days, considerate handling of employees is not only important, employees simply expect it. Employees were once expected to do what they were told and then take home their pay. But today, employees are dissatisfied with this. They want to be stretched, to learn new skills and make noticeable progress. If a business can’t cultivate its staff properly, it will find its workforce defecting to companies that care more about the development of their staff. It’s therefore imperative that you grow your employees! But how do you do that? In the next blinks, you’ll find out. What’s the first thing you should do when planning your garden? Prepare your soil! Without fertile soil, you’ll never grow hardy, healthy plants. The same goes for your employees; everything should begin with a fertile environment. Create this by listening to your employees. By doing so, you can set up an environment where information is quickly and openly exchanged and where your employees are aware of their own value. For example, if you always lend an ear to an employee, you will discover what they think, where they feel pressured and how they want to improve. Knowing this helps you prepare fertile ground for developing them. To become a better listener, try really paying attention to people. When they speak to you, pause what you’re doing and show them you’re listening. If the situation calls for it, you can even jot down notes to demonstrate that you are taking in what they are saying. When planting a garden, the next thing you do after preparing the soil is place the right plants in the right areas. Plants that love the sun won’t thrive in the shade and shade-loving plants will wilt in the sun. Employees are no different: You need to position them in areas that suit them best. But how? Look at the employees who are perfect for their role. What characteristics do they possess? What makes them effective workers? For instance, let’s say you have a wonderful HR manager. Part of what makes her wonderful is her openness and ability to listen. So these are probably crucial competencies for this position. When you write a job description for this position, therefore, you should make sure these competencies are highlighted, thereby increasing the likelihood that only suitable candidates apply. Now that you have a healthy growth environment and you know what to look for, let’s look at the process of choosing the right employees. Choosing which plants to put in your garden is a bit simpler than choosing which employees to hire, because gardening stores conveniently label all their plants and affix tags to them instructing you on how best to care for them. If only employees came with such instructions! A tag saying “works well with others” or “innovative if given enough space” would be a huge help! But, of course, getting the best out of your employees usually means a lot of guesswork. There is, however, a way to make this process easier. Enter the scenario-based interview. Scenario-based interviewing puts future employees in situations where they have to demonstrate their skills, knowledge and characteristics, rather than just talking about them. In a regular interview, people often misrepresent or exaggerate their abilities or qualifications. For instance, someone may consider himself an ideal manager, when in fact his management skills leave a lot to be desired. In extreme cases, potential employees flat out lie. It’s harder to fabricate information in scenario-based interviews, where interviewers ask candidates to explain what they would do in a specific situation. Let’s say you’re interviewing for a personnel manager. Here are some useful questions you might ask: “Imagine one of your most loyal employees is not performing at their best. How would you deal with this?” and “Which techniques will you use to overcome the problem?” This approach prompts a more accurate and more authentic answer. Ask multiple candidates if it’s good to be proactive and you’ll get a string of similar answers. Ask what they would do in a specific scenario and you’ll get individual, varied answers, which reveal far more about the qualities and abilities of the person you’re interviewing. But then, after selecting the right person for the job, how do you make sure they keep growing? Amateur gardeners often overreact when things don’t go as expected. Their plants look like they’re wilting, and so, instead of patiently waiting for an improvement, they douse them with fertilizer or water them to death. Neither of which, of course, does any good. Similarly, we often react poorly when dealing with employees. When an employee slips up, we tend to react too quickly, jumping on the employee’s mistake and scrambling to fix it ourselves. But what does this achieve? It might solve the problem, but the employee won’t have learned from the mistake, and it’ll probably be repeated. If you intervene like this, your employee may also feel discouraged and disempowered. A far better approach is to adopt a coach’s mind-set. This is where you look for the origin of a mistake and attempt to draw lessons from whatever went wrong. There could be a multitude of reasons for a mistake: Perhaps the employee misunderstood you. Perhaps you weren’t clear enough. So don’t jump to conclusions. One way to avoid doing this is to sit down with the employee and listen to what he or she says and thinks about what went wrong. Once you’ve gotten to the bottom of the mistake, you can start making adjustments that’ll prevent it from happening again. To reap the best results in coaching and developing employees, though, you’ll need a positive mind-set. A typical negative attitude would be: “What’s wrong with these people? Can’t they do anything right?” Conversely, a positive attitude gives you faith in your employees. Helpful self-talk to get you in this headspace might include: “I truly think Thomas can do this. I just have to help him get clear on what it will take” or “Laura is struggling to get things right. We should sit together and talk about it.” Now that you’re thinking like a coach and have a positive attitude toward your employees, let’s look at how to maintain your great employees. You’re proud of the fantastic employees you’ve grown. But just as you take action to keep your garden growing, you must do certain things to keep your team flourishing. While these things aren’t that difficult, they are not always exactly fun. So it’s best to do them well and in order. This will prevent any less-than-desirable results. In order to nurture great employees, you need to establish clear performance agreements. These are like the stakes you drive into the ground to support your plants, and you and your employee must both know why they are there. For instance, such an agreement might have to do with the amount of output an employee commits to over a certain period of time. For a designer, this might be a pledge to create three new sketches a month. These agreements enable employees to concentrate on priorities and understand what is expected of them. For example, without the agreement to generate three new sketches per month, the designer might spend too much time assisting colleagues or procrastinating. Another way to keep employees improving is by giving constant feedback. Rather than always dishing out positive feedback, however, give corrective feedback. This will push your employees forward. Make sure you stay specific when you’re offering corrective feedback and refer to concrete examples. Try starting your sentences like this:  “Yesterday I noticed that you...” or “During our last meeting you...” This is much more helpful than saying, “Every time that you...” Specificity helps the employee understand exactly which actions demanded feedback. Additionally, make sure that you tell the employee why this feedback is important and how important it is. For example, tell your salesperson that it’s critical that she reaches her quota so that the company can meet its growth goals, and that if she can’t make the necessary changes, the company will have a lower profit, which in turn could put a dent in her and her colleagues’ salaries. When you take good care of a plant, you often get the pleasure of witnessing it bloom and grow into a beautiful bush or shrub. You can then take clippings from this plant and grow them in your garden. And just as plants can flourish and propagate, so can your employees. Develop them in the right way and you could move them into higher positions. This is where delegation comes in. Delegating means providing employees with the chance to make their own decisions and learn from their own mistakes. Delegating does require a careful balance, however. If you are too pushy and hands-on, your staff won’t learn the skills they need for managerial roles. You’ll constantly need to intervene and correct their mistakes. Of course, stepping back entirely is also not the answer, as being too liberal can have catastrophic effects. A staff left alone with no vision or leader can lead to an ineffective and unpleasant survival-of-the-fittest mentality. The answer is a balance between the two: Give your staff enough space, but also give them direction and feedback. Getting delegation right results in your staff learning new skills, which is where the path to management begins. Giving employees new responsibilities is also key, as this often forces them to learn new skills. Imagine you have been working with a photography assistant for three years and they’ve gotten to know your schedule like the back of their hand. Adding to their responsibility by asking them to manage your schedule will force them to improve and refine their time-management skills. As your employees add more skills to their repertoire, and become highly proficient in their own role, it may be necessary to promote them and offer them new responsibilities. This will help them expand their skill-set even more. So now you’ve got employee cultivation down to a fine art. You can prepare the ground for them and keep them growing. That’s great! But what do you do when employees turn bad? Some plants don’t grow like you thought they would, forcing you to give them more attention and time than you have. It’s the same with employees. They may also let you down and require more time and energy than you’d anticipated. Over her career, the author came to realize that employees who fail to fulfill their basic responsibilities are perhaps the biggest source of stress and anxiety for their managers. These are the people who ignore your feedback, no matter how tactfully you offer it; people who repeatedly make the same mistakes in spite of your advice; or those who constantly fall short of the quotas stipulated in their contracts. Expending energy to get these people to become better employees uses up a lot of managerial time. Moreover, observing them in a rut and unwilling or unable to progress can shake your confidence and wrack your nerves. So what can you do? If the employee doesn’t react to constructive feedback, you may need to face the facts and fire them. Just as an expert gardener must sometimes weed out the plants that won’t grow, you’ll have to prune away the employees who don’t contribute to their team. This isn’t a pleasant task, so here are a couple of helpful tips. First, you have to know that the decision is absolutely necessary. If you’re in doubt, it might be worth putting in new effort to grow the employee. Next, behave impeccably. That means having good timing – no one wants to be fired on Christmas Eve, for example – and being polite and respectful. Finally, follow up properly. Be sure the person you let go has completed all the necessary HR and legal requirements. You’ll find that once the troublesome people have been weeded out from the team, it will clear the way for positive morale and improved performance. Just like a garden, a team where everyone plays their role well is a thing of beauty. The key message in this book: Much like plants in a beautiful garden, employees require the right care and skill from their managers in order for them to flourish. If you can consciously and skillfully tend to them, you will witness positive growth and productivity spread throughout your company.   Got feedback?

Schein","summary":"Helping others is one of the most fundamental human activities. Our whole civilization is built on it. We’re linked, as if by a long chain of hands, by the ways in which we offer help to one another. A mother feeds her child, a bricklayer passes a tool to his workmate, a therapist helps her patient. But why does it so often go wrong? How is it possible that the man who tries to rescue a burning house is sued for damages? Why do patients get angry with their doctors? Why is workplace collaboration sometimes fraught with tension? We’re often called upon to help in our daily lives, and the experience can be unsatisfactory for both the helper and the person being helped.  Throughout the following blinks, we’ll explore how our social and psychological dynamics can be an obstacle to healthy helping relationships and the ways in which we can be better helpers. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to respond when asked for directions; that our closest relationships can be like economic transactions; and why a humble inquiry is the best way to begin when helping someone.  Imagine a soccer team in full flow, from its strikers to its central defenders. To win the match, everything depends on each team member successfully helping the other players. If help isn’t quickly provided, then the striker gets tackled before he can shoot, the attacking midfielder has nobody to pass to and the goalkeeper is left vulnerable.  Just like in a game of soccer, helping is intrinsic to many aspects of our lives. In fact, it’s so ingrained in our every-day lives that we tend to forget just how important it is. Just think of your workplace. If you couldn’t rely on getting help from your colleagues when you need it, or they from you, you probably wouldn’t be able to accomplish much.  So how do we help each other? Let’s look at supervisors and subordinates in a work environment. To achieve an objective at work – to finish a project or improve sales, for instance – the boss and her subordinates are dependent on each other’s help. They enter into a kind of psychological contract. This is most clearly noticeable when one side fails to provide enough help and tensions flare. We’ve all been hollered at when we haven’t pulled our weight, and the group deadline is approaching.  The very glue of our society is based on helping each other. Just think of all the different situations in which people provide help. It might be the stranger offering directions to backpackers stumbling blindly around a foreign city, the good friend supplying a word that’s on the tip of your tongue or the suicide hotline operator advising someone in serious distress. Our lives are defined by these vital reciprocal relationships, without which there is no family, no work, no games and no society or civilization to speak of. What connects a doctor delivering a baby with a divorce lawyer? What links someone saving a life at the swimming pool with the grandson doing his elderly grandmother a favor? Let’s find out by looking at the three types of helping. The first of these categories is informal help. This form of help is the most common and covers all of the routine cooperative, collaborative and alturistic behavior in our lives. It’s taken for granted as the basis for civilized society. The mother helping her child to tie his shoelaces, the shopper lifting a can of tomatoes off the top shelf for an elderly person or the first aid responder performing CPR at the scene of an accident – all are examples of informal help. Next, comes semi-formal help. We seek semi-formal help when we require assistance with our homes, cars, computers and other areas that require complicated technical solutions. In contrast to informal help, its semi-formal cousin usually entails paying someone to help us with a small, technical task, such as calling a hotline to help fix a frozen PC screen, or a bank to assist us with opening an account.  Finally, there is formal help. This kind of help is more high-risk than semi-formal help and entails legal or medical assistance from highly qualified, trained professionals. The pregnant woman who needs the expertise of an obstetrician, or the corporation that hires a management consultant to advise them, are both examples of seeking formal help. Most books about “helping” are on formal help, but we require informal and semi-formal help much more frequently throughout our lives. For instance, it’s a more common occurrence to ask a friend for relationship advice than it is to hire an asset manager, yet much of our critical attention goes on the latter. So, while most of what’s written on the topic is on formal help, it’s informal and semi-formal help that shapes our lives the most. And it’s often in these areas that we struggle to form the best helping relationships. We don’t like to admit it to ourselves, but we know that many of our social relationships revolve around a simple mantra: “if you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.” The nature of give-and-take can sometimes feel transactional. In fact, we can see how closely our social relationships mirror the logic of economics by looking at some common expressions in the English language. We “pay” our respects and “pay” attention. We speak of the “pay-off” when something goes well. And we are “owed” the courtesy of a reply. Likewise, you can be “sold up the river” if you’re tricked into something you didn’t want to do. You can “sell yourself short” if you don’t do yourself justice in an interview.   Economics is deeply embedded in our daily lives. We expect to have “equitable” social interactions with loved ones, colleagues and people we meet in passing; we expect a fair “exchange.” For instance, when we decide to share a personal problem with a good friend, we expect them to listen attentively and take us seriously. Equally, when we tell our friend that we have something important to tell them they expect their attentiveness to be rewarded with our honesty. It wouldn’t be an “equitable” exchange if your friend simply yawned and got up from the table or, equally, if after requesting their attention, you decided to abruptly change the topic. Although it sounds counterintuitive, helping resembles an economic exchange, too. Consider the dynamics at work in the following scenario. If you offered money to a homeless person so they could buy themselves food, you might expect some kind of thanks – even just a grateful nod. And if they didn’t acknowledge your help at all, the whole equilibrium of the “helping relationship” would’ve been upset. Therefore, it’d be necessary to “compensate” for your loss of face, either by consoling yourself with your moral worth or by criticizing the homeless person. You might reassure yourself that you are a good person for acting so charitably or bitterly think of the homeless person as an ungrateful wretch. To understand how helping relationships work, we need to acknowledge the reciprocal dynamic of human society. This dynamic makes things much easier when giving or receiving help. Next, let’s look at how helping resembles the world of theater. “All the world’s a stage,” as Shakespeare put it. And half of the time, we all feel like actors, fools and jesters.  This too is revealed in the English language. For instance, even when we’re a long way from the theater, we still might remark that someone “gave quite the performance.” Also, we’re told to get our “act together,” or that we are not “acting like our usual selves.” Sometimes we even talk about our surroundings as if they were the stage. We long for a “change of scenery” or wonder what is “going on backstage.” What’s more, the theatrical “roles” we perform exist within the context of a social hierarchy. When we’re children, for instance, we quickly learn how to act with deference to our parents and teachers. Then, as adults, we learn what kind of behavior is required of us to maintain authority, whether we’re parents, teachers or bosses. As subordinates, we learn how to incline our heads and adopt a listening posture, while as superiors, we take on an authoritative tone of voice. Even our clothing signals what kind of role we play: subordinates usually wear more casual attire in the office, while the managers set themselves apart with a sharp suit or business dress.  As with everything else, helping is a kind of performance, too. When we provide or ask for help, we necessarily take on roles that resemble a choreographed performance. For example, when you enter a gas station looking puzzled, the attendant will deliver the customary line of attendants everywhere: “May I help you?” They’ll maintain the familiar neutral-but-helpful demeanor. Then, when we accept more detailed help – from a lawyer or a counselor, for instance – the helper won’t stray beyond the careful norms and etiquette of people in those professions. By standardizing the roles of helper and client, we create a framework in which both can “maintain face.” The social dynamics, which means that the helper has a temporary advantage over the client, are carefully managed when we play these roles. These are the cultural rules of our society. We must play our roles appropriately, in a complementary way, to make giving and receiving help a pleasure rather than a chore. You’d think that helping would be the easiest thing in the world, but just like with many other aspects of our lives, asking for help isn’t always as simple as it seems. For a start, receiving help can feel like a loss of status. Consider the male stereotype that real men don’t ask for help – they figure it out for themselves. It reveals the deep anxiety that lots of people feel when asking for assistance, especially men in Western countries within a competitive work culture. Indeed, it’s often the case that people feel “one down” when asking for help. The author recounts an occasion when he was working as a consultant for a group of European executives. When he bumped into them in the executive dining room, he discovered that they wouldn’t meet his gaze. He asked a colleague why this was and learned that they were ignoring him to save face because they were ashamed to have even sought consultation. They thought it would weaken their status in the eyes of other executives. Conversely, helping transfers status onto the helper, and this can be equally counterproductive. It’s very difficult to say “I don’t know how to help” because when we help people we feel empowered. It’s difficult to refuse the sense of one-upmanship that helping grants us. For instance, if you’re asked to solve a computer malfunction and you don’t know how, it can be tempting to try to fix it anyway. Of course, if you lack the expertise, you might end up making things worse! As helping opens up the possibility of an ego-boosting social encounter, it’s difficult to say no – even when our help might be worse than useless. Much of what goes wrong with helping is because of this status imbalance. When we ask for help and feel disempowered, we might not communicate properly with those who assist us. Rather than act in harmony with our helper, we get irritable, resistant and appear ungrateful. On the other hand, if we provide help and don’t receive gratitude because the client feels one down and defensive, we take offense. All problems relating to helping begin with this imbalance between helper and client. Acknowledging this is the first, crucial step to overcoming the obstacles that prevent a healthy helping relationship. In the next blink, we’ll look at the different ways in which we complicate the helping relationship from the position of the client. You might have heard the phrase “he doesn’t help himself” when referring to someone engaged in a self-defeating spiral. What does that mean in more detail, though? Firstly, sometimes we don’t reveal the full extent of our problem. Consider the spouse who frequently stands before the bedroom mirror and asks his wife whether his clothes still suit him. Rather than his fashion sense, his real anxiety might be the weight he’s put on. Similarly, when the company manager asks for assistance with team-building, her real problem might be that she has lost faith in her subordinates, but can’t face that fact. Sometimes we even attack the helper. There are occasions when we might ridicule those providing help, because we feel powerless and want to restore equilibrium. A good example of this is the patient laughing in their counselor’s face in an exasperated manner: “Nothing you do is helping! You’re useless!” And there are times when we have preconceptions about the people helping us. We might stereotype them, assuming they’re like a bad teacher or unhelpful parent from our past. Naturally, this will prevent us from responding to the help provided in a productive way. Another issue is that we might become over-dependent on our helper. Think of those times when you’ve been unable to solve a difficulty, and then found someone who can. Whether that’s helping you with directions or acquiring a bank loan, your first reaction is often to collapse in gratitude and relief. And you’ll forget that to solve the problem, you might be required to act yourself rather than transfer the whole burden onto the helper. For instance, when recovering in hospital from a serious illness, we must learn how to get out of bed, go to the bathroom and dress ourselves. Over-reliance on the nurses means that we’re not able to build up our strength. In other words, relying too much on the help of others means we’re not able to help ourselves as much as we should. So what can we learn here? Though the onus is on the helper to provide the best assistance they can, as clients, we can “oil the gears,” so to speak, by being sensitive to the many ways in which we frustrate the helping process. We’ve all heard the phrase “sometimes you need to be cruel to be kind.” It’s what we’re told when helping someone in the usual sense would be counterproductive. But there are other ways in which our willingness to help can set people back too. When you’re too eager to help someone, you might fail to see the extent of their problem or even misidentify their problem entirely. This is because people who request help might really be testing the waters and hiding a more serious difficulty that they actually require help with. For instance, if your child asks for help with his homework, it could mean that you immediately jump in to help without a second thought. But if he is still emotionally distraught after you’ve helped him, it could be that the problem wasn’t the homework at all, but perhaps something bigger, like being bullied at school, that he’s disguising. In situations like this, it’s important that we don’t focus on satisfying our own eagerness to help, but instead try to identify the underlying issues that really require our assistance. Another way that we can be unintentionally unhelpful is when we pressure people into taking our help. There are times when, though someone requests help and we’re certain that our advice or practical assistance is just the right thing for them, it’ll actually make things worse. And because the person who requested help doesn’t want to offend, they’ll let us continue regardless. For instance, people may let a friend give them an impromptu massage when they complain of a stiff neck, but are too polite to say when the amateurish masseuse makes it worse. And conversely, sometimes we’re too reticent with help-giving. There are occasions when our unwillingness to intrude on someone’s difficulties can be a real problem. Treading on eggshells, we’ll take care not to offend someone’s sensitivities and avoid asking if they require help. This is more often the case in professional circumstances. For instance, the PhD supervisor might assume that their candidate – who, though intelligent and mature, appears to be struggling – would be offended by a simple suggestion. And so they refrain and the problem is compounded.   Sounds like a minefield, doesn’t it? In the final blink, let’s look at the best way to help more effectively. We’re sometimes reminded that we’ve got two ears and one mouth. Or in other words, that we’d be better off listening more and talking less. Helping people is all about listening. But before we listen, we first need to make a humble inquiry. To avoid the misunderstandings intrinsic to helping, it is best first to inquire. As we’ve already seen, the problem that we’re presented with often isn’t the full story. By inquiring in an open-minded way we can tease out the rest.  Consider this scenario. A woman approaches you and asks for driving directions to a certain street, in an agitated manner. Rather than just pointing her to the street, you ask her gently where she’s headed exactly. She informs you that she’s driving to the big toy store, to buy her little girl a late birthday present. She’s new to the area, she adds. Knowing how terrible the traffic on that road is, you know that she’d be better off heading to a nearby car-park and then walk to the store. Through this simple inquiry, you are more helpful than by simply sending her off with the street directions. One of the other crucial functions of this inquiry is to put the helper and client on an equal footing. For instance, when a weakened hospital patient needs assistance to reach their bedpan, if we communicate with humility, we can help them more effectively. Rather than bossing them around in a humiliating fashion, it’s better to ask them if they are comfortable or ready to take the next step. By attempting to alleviate the loss of status, we create a helping relationship that allows the patient to move more confidently. Another objective of the humble inquiry is to restore confidence in the person seeking help so that they might begin to help themselves. For example, a child might be embarrassed to tell their parents that they’re not able to tie their shoelaces. But by restoring their self-esteem – perhaps by asking them if they knew that we all find it difficult to tie shoelaces at first – they might attempt the knot with more confidence. What can we take from this? Well, people are often reticent and insecure when they ask for help. To ease the whole process, we have to be humble and encouraging. The key message in these blinks: Social dynamics complicate the way we help each other. When we receive help, we suffer a loss of status and self-esteem, while providing help gives us the upper hand in a way that can be counterproductive. To successfully assist others, we should be sensitive to these dynamics. As help-givers, it’s best to inquire with humility about the problems we’re attempting to solve.  Actionable advice: Keep checking if your help is still required When you’re helping someone, check periodically whether your help is proving useful or not. You don’t need to overdo it, but it’s good to keep an open line of communication. This will ensure that you provide the right kind of assistance, and it’ll also save you from wasting time and energy on a futile endeavor. Helping your child with their math homework? Make sure that it’s really necessary – and that you’re not doing it just to prove that you can still do long division!    Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Having brilliant or average employees can make or break your business. If you want to grow a strong team and a flourishing business, you’d better know how to hire. The problem is that too many people make the same mistakes over and over again. They don’t know how to conduct interviews or write good job descriptions, so they end up hiring the wrong people and wasting resources managing and firing them. Then they have to start the whole process over again. These blinks explain how to avoid those consequences and push your team forward by enticing and hiring the best candidates. In these blinks, you’ll learn the interview trick that’ll prevent your personal biases blocking the right hire; what great talent looks  for in a job description; and one way to ensure people complete applications on your company’s website. How do you attract the best candidates when trying to fill a position? First, you need to educate yourself on some common misconceptions about hiring. Recruiters often make mistakes in the interview process. They sometimes give too much weight to the interaction between the candidate and interviewer, instead of focusing on the candidate’s abilities and motivation for the job. Moreover, most hiring decisions are overly influenced by the interaction at the start of the interview. An interpersonal relationship develops between the candidate and interviewer right away, and that can end up swaying the interviewer too much. If you immediately like a candidate, you’re more likely to ask them easy questions as the interview goes on. If the candidate lacks certain skills, you might dismiss this, thinking they’ll be able to learn them later. On the other hand, if you dislike someone from the start, you’ll probably be harsher on them. You might subconsciously start looking for their flaws to prove that your negative first impression was correct. We also have a natural tendency to focus on candidates’ skills instead of their ability to actually do the job at hand. When you put too much emphasis on a person’s performance in an interview, you might lose sight of what the job actually involves. So remind yourself to focus on your candidate’s capabilities, not the impression they give off. Aim for objectivity. You’ll pay more attention to performance requirements when you push yourself to be more objective. How can you do this? First off, wait at least 30 minutes after an interview before you make any hiring decisions. Don’t just go with your first impression of the person. The real key to ensuring that you’re hiring by performance is to create performance profiles. Read on to see how they work. Most people recruit by writing a job description that contains a long list of desired skills or traits. That’s not the most effective method, however. It’ll only lead you to recruit average employees. So don’t rely on job descriptions. Use performance profiles instead. A performance profile outlines the goals of the position, rather than the skills and qualifications it requires. It’s a great way to filter out your candidates. So don’t just say you’re looking for a candidate who’s good at market research, for instance. Say you expect the person to “prepare a comprehensive competitive analysis report in the first month.” When you emphasize specific tasks, you’ll turn the job’s requirements into measurable objectives. Focus on what your candidates can do, rather than what they have. Your employee’s skills aren’t what matters – it’s what they can do with them that counts. When you’re preparing your performance profile, set a benchmark for the ideal candidate. How would the best possible employee do the job? For example, the author was familiar with a jewelry-making business that struggled with a high turnover rate in the polishing department. When they started benchmarking, they found that the best performers were people with an eye for detail. So they started giving candidates pieces of jewelry to evaluate during their interviews, to assess their attention to detail. The strategy worked: their turnover rate decreased. Giving candidates a task is much more useful than having them respond to a job description. The best candidates look for positions based on what they’ll be doing and learning, not the skills they already have. They’re interested in bettering themselves and growing. An ambitious person won’t be attracted to a job description that’s just a boring list of duties, so use performance profiles if you want to bring in the best people. Many businesses struggle to develop a recruitment process that’s efficient. Some even have entire departments devoted to recruitment. That can really eat up your resources. Many companies forget what the true purpose of a recruiting department is supposed to be. Recruitment should be about finding the best candidates in the shortest period of time at the lowest possible cost. Instead, businesses put out lackluster ads full of boring details and hope they’ll somehow attract the right person. Don’t go down that path. You’ll just end up shooting in the dark. Average job descriptions will bring in average people. If you use the same recruitment strategy as everyone else, your position and company won’t stand out at all. Strive to use a variety of interesting recruiting techniques instead. It’s a good idea to advertise your position online. Use a good career site and creative ads. The careers page on your own career website should also play a key role. So make sure it’s easy to find on your company’s homepage, aesthetically appealing, bug-free and straightforward to navigate. It’s very important that your application forms are user-friendly. In fact, studies have shown that if your application form can be auto-filled (by using auto-complete fields on LinkedIn, for example), applicants are 75 percent more likely to complete the application. Keep the process on your side efficient too. Call the top candidates within 24 hours of receiving their applications so they don’t get away. If they were hesitant about the job, they might not be as interested tomorrow. Remember: the companies that win in recruitment are those that have the most creative and aggressive recruitment programs. Here’s a tip: treat your candidates like potential customers, not future subordinates. Some employers use interviews as tests to see whether the candidate will fit in with the company or not. If you catch yourself doing that, stop. It’s not a good use of an interview. An interview should really be about testing to see if the person can do the job well. So use performance-based interviews instead. Performance-based interviews are about fact-finding. To give a performance-based interview, you need to ask two key questions. The first is the most significant accomplishment question, or MSA. Ask the candidate about the most important things they’ve accomplished in their career. Be sure to get all the details. If you’re interviewing for an entry-level position, ask them about a project they felt proud of. There are many ways you can phrase this. For example, you can ask, “Can you describe a project or task you were involved in that made you feel proud?” A good answer to the MSA question tells you almost everything you need to know to make a good hiring decision. So if the person tells you they’re proud that they once patched up a disorganized team and led them into giving a great presentation, you’ll know they’re a natural leader. The second most important thing to ask is the how-would-you question. Do that by describing a problem to the candidate and asking how they’d solve it. A candidate’s answer to a how-would-you question tells you how they think. It shows you how well they can improvise and solve job-specific problems. Imagine you’re interviewing for a sales management position. You might want to know how they’d approach selling a new product, for instance. Don’t hesitate to clarify the facts, either. Sometimes interviewers don’t ask follow-up questions because they’re afraid of appearing confused. Details are important, however, so make sure you get as many as you can. We’ve seen how first impressions can be deceptive in interviews. It’s easy to get hung up on emotional prejudices when hiring – you should actively strive to avoid that. So here are some good tips for staying focused on the right things during your recruitment process. First off, use evidence-based assessments. Evidence-based assessments ensure that you’re judging candidates using solid evidence, not just your gut feeling. So evaluate your candidates according to the job’s real demands. If you’ve made your performance profiles, you’ll already know what your ideal candidate looks like. More importantly, don’t let any interviewers make the hiring decisions on their own. Instead, have teams of people to decide who should be hired for a position. Draw up assessment charts too. Hold debriefing sessions after your interviews so you can share information and compare your thoughts. Panel interviews are also helpful. They eliminate a lot of the problems that arise in one-on-one interviews. There are a couple of reasons why panel interviews are a good idea. First, they’re more objective and goal-oriented. There’ll be less room for small talk, so the interview will be more on point. You can’t get sidetracked with trivia when there are three people conducting the interview. Panel interviews also make it easier to assess the candidate’s responses. In one-on-one interviews, you sometimes spend so much time thinking about the next question that you forget to listen to the person’s answer. When there are more people in the room, you can alternate the questions and focus more on the candidate. Panel interviews can be intimidating for the candidate, however. If you’re going to use a panel, warn them beforehand. An interview shouldn’t feel like an interrogation, after all. Interviews are important, but don’t hire anyone because of their interview alone. That shouldn’t be the only way you assess your candidates. Take care to check them out thoroughly. If not, you’ll just waste more time and resources training and firing someone you shouldn’t have hired in the first place. If you’re serious about a candidate, always do a reference check. A lot of interviewers skip this stage when they make up their minds too quickly. It’s a bad sign if your candidate doesn’t have any references. But positive references aren’t necessarily a good sign either – that’s why you need to check them. So ask the referees detailed questions about the candidate’s performance. Interview them as well! Be thorough. If a referee says your candidate has good people skills, ask for specific examples. Personal biases can present problems during reference checks. If you really like a candidate, you might unintentionally shy away from asking their referees tough questions about them. The author once knew a senior executive who had trouble with this. He got a call from an HR manager who said one of his candidates was a great analyst but an average manager. The HR manager liked the candidate, so he didn’t ask any further questions about their management skills. He focused on their strength as an analyst instead, with inevitable results. You should also do a background check on your candidates. Check their degrees, employment history, driving record and criminal record. If that sounds like too much work, you can hire a special firm to do it for you. You might think this all sounds like a lot of work just for recruitment, but remember: it’s worth it. Do the work in the beginning instead of finding out when it’s too late! Some people get confused about where the recruitment process actually begins and ends. In fact, it starts the day you announce the vacancy, and continues until the final interview. In the beginning of the recruitment process, the candidate is selling and the company is buying. The candidate has to earn the job by “selling” their skills and abilities. They have to prove they fit your profile. Not everyone is actually a good fit, however. That’s why you, as the employer, have to “buy” the person too. So learn as much as you can about your candidates before you commit to buying them – just as you would with any other major purchase. Once you’ve found the right person, the positions switch. You become the seller and they’re the buyer. When you make someone an employment offer, you’re really trying to sell the idea that your company is the best place for them to work. If they have other opportunities, you’ll have to work harder to show yours is the best. You could entice a strong candidate by offering them a mentor in the office, for instance. A mentor might be able to convince them that your company is good for their professional development. Never sell your job on the money alone. Always make it about opportunity! Other companies can always pay more – that’s not what wins great candidates. One important lesson the author learned in his 25 years of experience is that the best people rarely take jobs for the money. Instead, they take them because they want to fulfill their personal goals and ambitions. So ask yourself, “Why would a high-performing person want this job?” The key message in this book: Recruitment is one of the most important elements of your company. After all, your company is defined by your employees, so it’s essential to find the right ones. So strive to be objective, give thorough interviews and background checks, and negotiate well once you’ve found the right person. Offer them something more than just a good salary. Recruiting the best people will pay off enormously in the end. Actionable advice: Watch your words! Use action verbs in your performance profile. Create, build, change or improve are much better at describing the work that needs to be done than passive words like have to and be responsible for.

Maxwell","summary":"The world’s most successful people have one thing in common: they aren’t afraid to think outside the box and carve out their own path. But the journey along that road can be lonely. After all, we’re a sociable species by nature. We like fitting in, and the price of social acceptance is falling in with accepted ideas. Going against the grain, questioning common notions and striking out on your own isn’t likely to win you many friends. Yet just think where we’d be if everyone had always kept their brilliant ideas to themselves! To claim, as Copernicus did, that the earth wasn’t at the center of the universe must have struck his contemporaries as some form of madness. But he was right, and we’re forever in his debt for having stuck to his guns. That goes to show just how important creative thinking and tenacity are when it comes to success. But, as John C. Maxwell shows, you don’t have to be an Einstein or Galileo to have great ideas. In fact, everyone can learn to think creatively – all it takes is knowing the right techniques and a bit of practice! In these blinks, you’ll discover why learning to be empathetic will help you achieve success; what Alfred Nobel did after reading his own obituary; and what Paul McCartney and John Lennon can teach you about collaboration. General Electric CEO Jack Welch regularly tells his employees that existing relationships with clients are more important than individual sales. Why? Because he knows that, when it comes to being successful in the long run, it’s sometimes necessary to leave the nitty-gritty behind for a moment and consider the bigger picture. But how can you start cultivating big picture thinking? By making sure you’re always learning. Big picture thinkers are always looking for opportunities to learn. They’re constantly on the go, visiting new places, meeting new people and honing new skills. The author has a handy technique that puts him in the right mindset to do that: he starts his day by looking at his schedule and asking himself what learning opportunities are likely to present themselves. Once he’s noted down the activities that are most likely to teach him something, he mentally primes himself to be on high alert. That means he’s much more likely to be receptive to what’s going on around him. So when he once had dinner with National Football League (NFL) coach Dave Wannstedt, for instance, he was well prepared. He used the time to ask him all sorts of questions about teamwork and left the restaurant brimming with new insights. That’s something you can take up too: spend a couple of minutes each morning looking over your itinerary and ask yourself what opportunities to learn new things you’re likely to encounter. Making an effort to become a big picture thinker is important because it gives you a window into how other people see the world. In other words, it makes you more empathetic. And that’s good for your relationships: whether it’s your clients, husband or wife, children or friends, empathizing with those around you will help you understand what they want and need. Seeing the big picture ultimately helps you think beyond your own narrow interests and take those of others into account. What is reality? Don’t worry, this isn’t a philosophy lecture! In fact, there’s a pretty simple answer: reality is the difference between your desires and how the world actually is. If you want to succeed in the real world, you have to leave your daydreams behind and start thinking realistically. That means setting targets and drawing up a game plan that’ll put you in a position to hit them. Consider a businessman who isn’t a realistic thinker: He’s positive and full of hope about the company’s future. That’s a great attitude to have, but there’s a problem – he doesn’t have a strategy. And without a strategy, his company’s likely to fail. In the end, he’s a bad leader. Realistic thinking, by contrast, promotes excellent leadership. That’s because facing up to the way things really are forces you to clearly define your aims and formulate a plan of action that’ll get you there. Realistic thinking also helps simplify things. Stripping away all the unnecessary details and vague hopes and dreams makes you more efficient. But what if you’re an optimist, rather than a realist, by nature? Then you should start by doing your homework. That means getting to know the facts. Say you’re a business leader mulling over your next move: ask yourself what you’d do if your revenue dried up, a customer didn’t pay or the bottom fell out of the market you’re in. Spend time researching these scenarios – after all, your realistic thinking won’t amount to much if you’re basing it on insufficient information. It’s important to clear your mind of all preconceptions, prejudices and second-hand opinions when you’re doing this kind of background work. Instead of making assumptions, get to know the facts yourself. Chances are, you’re not the only person facing this particular situation. Your thinking needs to be solid, it doesn’t have to be original. You can learn a lot by looking at what other people have done in similar circumstances. As the author puts it, some of his best thinking was done by others. Whatever line of work you’re in, creativity is pure professional gold. Einstein once said that “imagination is more important than knowledge.” He was right. Your ideas are far more important than your role in a company or your job title. That said, Einstein was a genius – creative thinking was second nature to him. That might not apply to everyone, but there are techniques you can use to jumpstart your creativity. The first point to remember is that creativity doesn’t just mean having lots of original ideas – you can start thinking creatively by simply considering a greater number of options. That’s one hallmark of creatives: they take as many possibilities into account as they can, which in turn gets the creative juices flowing and stimulates the imagination. So if you’ve got a great idea, ask yourself what changes you could make to improve it. Think of it like a fishing net – the wider you cast it, the more fish you’re likely to catch. The reason that’s so important is that the best thinkers aren’t looking for the only answer – they’re looking for the best answer out of many. The added bonus? It’ll help you craft a backup plan in case your preferred solution doesn’t work out. Creative thinking also makes you and your ideas more attractive to other people. No wonder! Creativity is your intelligence having fun. People admire intelligence and are attracted to fun – it’s an irresistible combination. Leonardo da Vinci is one example of someone who had fun with their brilliant mind. The diversity of his ideas and interests is truly breathtaking: painter, architect, musician, engineer – he was the very definition of the Renaissance man. That doesn’t mean you have to paint the Mona Lisa and design helicopters in your spare time, however. Set your mind free and explore your creativity in your own field and you’ll find that people will be irresistibly drawn to you! Adopting new modes of thinking boosts your chances of success, but there’s also a way of thinking about the world that can change your entire life: unselfish thinking. Taking that up might just redefine your concept of success itself. That’s because helping others is hugely rewarding. In fact, few things are anywhere near as fulfilling. Spend a day serving others unselfishly and you’re pretty much guaranteed a sound night’s sleep. Take it from Alfred Nobel, who learned that the hard way. As he was reading the newspaper one day, he was shocked to find his own obituary. It was a mistake, of course, but it was an illuminating experience. So what did it say? The paper mainly talked about how the inventor’s most famous brainchild – dynamite – had been responsible for so many deaths. Nobel was appalled at the idea that this was how people would regard his legacy. Wracked by guilt, he decided to make a more positive contribution to the world by supporting peace. The idea of the Nobel prize – an award given in recognition of noteworthy achievements in various fields – was born in 1895. It just goes to show that even if you’ve pursued selfish ends your whole life, you can always turn things around! But the best thing about unselfish thinking is that it lets you become part of something much bigger than yourself. That’s something the pharmaceutical corporation Merck and Company showed in the mid-1980s. The company decided it wanted to achieve more than rack up ever-greater profits. After successfully developing a cure for river blindness – a disease afflicting millions in the developing world – the firm decided to give the drug away for free. After all, those who needed it the most were the least able to afford it. It became the cornerstone of the company’s credo that people are more important than profits. The lesson here is that it’s always better to be part of something fantastic than aiming to be fantastic yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in the crowd and thoughtlessly accept other people’s ideas about the world. That applies as much to business leaders falling in line with a company’s traditions as it does to new parents acting on the old wives’ tales their parents told them. Thinking for yourself can be a risky business. Stray too far from the herd, and you’re unlikely to make many friends. If everybody accepts something as true, then it must be, right? Well, no. Think of the belief that the earth was the center of the universe. Pretty much everyone thought you’d have to be mad to question that idea. Then along came the astronomer Copernicus in the sixteenth century and mathematically proved that our solar system revolves around the sun. Conventional wisdom is often downright deadly too. Before Joseph Lister pioneered antiseptic procedures in the nineteenth century, surgeons were convinced that there wasn’t any point in washing medical instruments. Humans often seek safety in numbers, but history shows that’s not the best way of determining what’s true. But how do you break your habit of relying on others’ assumptions? A good place to start is cultivating the habit of thinking things through for yourself before following others. Once you start considering what’s best rather than what’s popular, you’ll already be well on the way to success. Take the weeks immediately following the 9/11 terror attacks: there was a widespread perception that it wasn’t safe to fly or visit New York. The author saw things differently. Flights to the city were dirt cheap, security was at an all-time high and the price of hotels and theatre tickets had plummeted because of low demand. It was actually a fantastic time to take a city break! So a month after the tragedy he boarded a plane with his family and flew to New York. They enjoyed a wonderful experience that they’d never have been able to afford otherwise – all because they’d avoided the trap of popular thinking. Say you need to pick up a new skill – how would you go about it? Spend some time figuring it out by yourself or ask someone already in the know to teach you the ins and outs? If you’re likely to go with the former, it might be time to reconsider. Whether learning a new recipe, putting the finishing touches on that golf swing or mastering a new piece of software, you’ve got a much better chance of getting the hang of things if you learn from someone with experience. Collaboration is the mother of innovation – shared thinking trumps solo thinking every time. That might sound slightly counterintuitive. After all, brilliant thinkers are often depicted as brooding soloists going it alone. But that’s not the case – innovative breakthroughs rarely happen in a vacuum. More often than not, they’re the result of people working together. Einstein often said that his achievements were founded in the labors of other men. Or think of the work of brilliant duos like scientists Pierre and Marie Curie or musical wunderkinds Paul McCartney and John Lennon. When people combine their unique talents and ideas, the results can be incredible. But before you can start working with others, you need to adopt the right mindset. So what’s that all about? Well, as the author of How to Become CEO Jeffrey J. Fox puts it, you have to be on constant high alert for good ideas, regardless of how likely or unlikely the source is. That means dropping prejudices and really listening to people. The next great idea might come from your taxi driver or your children. The point is that you’ll never know unless you’re receptive. Just as important is striving to adopt a mentality based on collaboration rather than competition. Cooperation happens when your aim is to complete the ideas of others, rather than one-up them. So next time you’re in a meeting with colleagues, don’t focus on selfishly getting ahead – work toward achieving the team’s goals. The key message in these blinks: Success is all about attitude. You’ve probably heard about the benefits of positive thinking, but there’s more to it than that. Leading a happy, fulfilled life is about learning to think collaboratively and unselfishly. It’s about asking what you can do for and with others rather than simply trying to get ahead yourself. That means opening your mind to creativity and avoiding following the crowd. Once you start doing that, you’ll be mentally prepared for success. Actionable advice: Plan your life, not your day. Lots of people don’t think further than the day ahead. They wake up and go through their mental checklists of what they have to get done that day. What they’ll be doing a month or year from now rarely crosses their mind. But long-term planning is vital to success. So take a cue from the author and begin the month by reviewing your calendar. Think about what you want to accomplish over the next thirty days: what projects you want to complete, what your objectives are and how much time to set aside for family and friends? This perspective will help you find the time you need to get the things that matter most done and make you happier and more successful! Got feedback?

Schein","summary":"It’s Monday morning, and your boss calls you in and says, “I’ve noticed that your work is poor, and I think that you’re approaching the problem incorrectly…” Put on the spot like this, how do you think you would feel? Probably pretty disheartened and downcast, right? What’s more, rather than trying to improve your work, you might start resenting your boss. Now imagine a different approach. Your boss says “How’s it going with your work? Would you change anything?” With this subtle shift, you look at the situation differently, and feel engaged instead of put down. These blinks show the power of “humble inquiry,” or, in other words, how to ask instead of tell. The secrets of communication that will be revealed are vital for leaders in any sphere. In the following blinks, you’ll also learn: what the best way is to win a relay race; how you should behave in the presence of a Nobel Prize laureate; and why we shouldn’t shout at children. What comes to mind when you think of a great team? Consider some of your favorite sports teams whose courage and unity on the field resulted in a winning season. So what makes a great team? Is it enough to put a bunch of talented people in the same room? Well, no. What makes a great team is the relationships between team members. Strong communication skills cement these relationships. Each member of the team, from the quarterback to the lineman, is comfortable telling each other anything. “Go left!” “I’m open!” “Great pass!” Each player expresses what they need to say without fear; opinions are voiced freely and everyone gets a chance to participate. Many leaders in business try hard to emulate the teamwork found in sports teams they admire, but ultimately fail due to communication barriers, often between managers and employees. Employees are often simply too afraid to share with their boss any issues they might have, fearing that voicing their needs or criticism will reflect poorly on them. Think about it: would you feel comfortable walking up to your boss and telling him the company strategy was full of holes? This lack of communication can have terrible consequences. For example, it was precisely this sort of communication breakdown – the inability of information at the lowest levels of a company to reach those at the top – that led to the devastating Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Businesses leaders therefore need to create and nurture an environment where employees feel that they can freely share their thoughts and ideas, no matter what they are. This is, of course, easier said than done. The following blinks will show you how. Imagine you’re the head of your department and, to build morale, you challenge another department to a relay race. You’re the first off the mark, and as you reach the first swap, you shout “Stick out your left hand!” to your employee so you can pass her the baton. As you’re the boss, she reflexively sticks out her left hand. Unfortunately, she has a finger injury which causes her to drop the baton just as you’ve slapped it into her hand. What could you have done differently? You have to remember that, as the boss, people might be scared of disagreeing with you. For this reason, you’ll have to rely on the power of humble inquiry. Humble inquiry is about asking questions in a way that shows your colleagues that their perspective matters and, importantly, that you respect their decisions. Before the relay race, you could have easily asked your colleague, “In which hand should I place the baton?” rather than simply making a demand. Humble inquiry is more than just a strategy for formulating questions; it’s an attitude. As the chair of a department composed of 15 professors, the author once received a note from the dean that the department’s phone bill was too high. He was also given a list of calls made by each professor to aid him in locating the problem and resolving it. The way he saw it, there were three ways to solve the problem. He could get the professors together to go through the list collectively; he could go through the list on his own and call the guilty parties individually; or, he could send the list to each professor, tell them about the problem and ask them how to fix it. The third option put the most trust in and dependency on his fellow professors, so he went with that option. And it worked! Several faculty members admitted making personal calls and racking up charges, and so promised to stop. There are many ways to ask a question. You could beat around the bush, hoping you’ll get the information you need without offending anyone. Or you could cut right to the chase. Yet, however you decide to ask, do it humbly. But what does humble look like in practice? When you use humble inquiry, you’re showing that you really want to know what’s in the other person’s mind. When we say “really,” we mean it. Humble inquiry is sincere by definition. In addition to this, people will know how much you really care based on subtle cues, such as body language and tone of voice. Ken Olsen, the founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, liked to wander around the company offices and occasionally stop at an engineer’s desk to ask, “What are you working on?” This simple question, a model of humble inquiry, would lead to a conversation that was pleasing both personally and professionally. Not only did these questions help Olsen get to know his employees, but also he knew exactly what each of his engineers was doing. It was this inquisitive yet humble style that earned Olsen the respect of his 100,000 employees. Sometimes, however, you need to dig deeper or steer a conversation in a direction that interests you. This is where diagnostic inquiry comes into play. Diagnostic inquiry helps you learn more about a specific point by asking questions that are directly relevant to the point. For example, if you’re with a friend who is talking about how he’s recently changed jobs, you could ask diagnostic questions such as: What made you decide to make a move? What could have caused this? Why did it make you feel that way? Diagnostic inquiry should also be humble in the sense that the person you are questioning doesn’t feel offended by your queries, and feels their input is valued. Humble inquiry can be further divided into two other types of inquiry, depending on what you need to accomplish. For example, if you need to push a conversation in a certain direction, you can use confrontational inquiry. This type involves introducing your own ideas in the form of a question. With confrontational inquiry, you’re still curious and interested in the conversation, but also feel you could add something meaningful or get important information from your conversation partner. For example, if during a meeting you notice a few colleagues squirming in their chairs, you might ask another coworker afterwards “Do you think they were squirming because they were frightened?” rather than simply, “Why were they squirming like that?” Yet remember that the person you are questioning should never actually feel confronted by your questions; they must know that your motives are always pure. Speaking of motives, it’s important to identify your own before engaging in confrontational inquiry. If you see a conversation as merely a way to test your assumptions, then don’t use this strategy. Only use confrontational inquiry when you want to help your conversation partner and you want to learn more about their perspective. To ensure that a conversation is based in humility, you might need to focus in on the conversation itself through process-oriented inquiry. Sometimes, you’ll notice that a conversation has become derailed in a way that suggests that your conversation partner is uncomfortable. In these cases, you might need to probe for more information about how your partner feels about the conversation itself. For example, you can ask her things like: “Are we still OK?”, “Have I offended you?”, “Is this conversation moving in the right direction?” or “Am I being too personal?” This kind of inquiry focuses on the relationship between you and your conversation partner, and ensures that neither party is stressed and that everyone’s expectations are being met. So far, you’ve learned about what humble inquiry is and how it can be applied. The next blinks will detail the common hurdles that stand between you and open communication. Have you ever asked a coworker for help with a project, only to have them to reply bluntly: “No. Can’t you see I’m busy with my own work?!” Harsh answers like these often make us feel deflated and unhappy. Unfortunately, this attitude is deeply ingrained in today’s task accomplishment culture, and it can have dire consequences for your business. In today’s American workplace, people earn status by completing the tasks that they’re assigned. So if you work as a tax analyst for the Internal Revenue Service, you’ll be given a list of accounts to audit and will be expected to make it through the entire list. Those people who are the best at going through the list and accomplishing all their tasks are usually the ones rewarded with a promotion. These newly promoted employees are then expected to manage those “below” them by dictating their tasks to them. This approach is known as do-and-tell, and it fosters a culture where those at the top disrespect those who are subordinate to them.   Not only is this disrespect unwarranted, it also poses an immediate barrier to good communication within a team. For starters, do-and-tell favors telling over asking – so much so, in fact, that asking questions is viewed as a sign of weakness and incompetence. A manager who asks his employees “What can we do here?” is viewed as someone who doesn’t know enough about his job to earn his job title. Telling, on the other hand, is seen as a virtue! In a revealing example, when the author asked management students what it means being promoted to manager, they answered, “It means I can now tell others what to do.” This attitude is deeply flawed, and only stands in the way of good communication and thus good work. Rank plays an all too important role in business and culture today. For instance, if someone saw a CEO golfing with the office janitor, that would be hot company gossip the next day. Why is this? This obsession with status and rank merely places unnecessary barriers between people, and prevents fruitful relationships. In fact, these roles and status symbols can impact how and whether we engage in humble inquiry. When we meet new people, we immediately start asking questions to determine whether they have a higher or lower status than we do, and our attitudes toward them change accordingly. For example, the author was at a meeting when some undergraduates approached him and asked to have their picture taken with him. His automatic assumption was that, as a professor, he had a higher status than they did, and that he should just act flattered and pose with a big smile. In contrast, when he was later introduced to a Nobel Prize-winning physicist (who the author felt had a higher status than he did), he was overcome with awe and so his demeanor changed: he became more respectful and made more humble inquiries. As this example shows, we’re a lot less likely to make humble inquiries if we believe that we have a higher status than others. So how does all this play out in the professional world? In do-and-tell organizations, we naturally demonstrate humility only to those who we feel have control over us in some way. In contrast, when we’re in charge, we treat others with less respect. If you’re buying a suit at a store, for example, the sales associate will likely be very respectful toward you – perhaps even too respectful! It’s unlikely, however, that you, as the customer, will demonstrate the same degree of respect. Yet when you’re having your suit tailored, you’re much more likely to respect the directions of your tailor, because he is in control. We’ve seen how social status gets in the way of humble inquiry. Now we’ll look at how our mind-set affects which questions we ask. We naturally don’t like criticism. As a result, most of us make a concerted effort to hide our feelings. This, of course, has consequences. Playing it safe, for example, harms our ability to form relationships, which are vital to humble inquiry. So how can you avoid this mind-set? One way is to intentionally open up to others by revealing something to them about yourself. You will soon find that, having demonstrated that it’s safe to express yourself, it will be easier for the rest of your team to open up. If you like karaoke, for example, you might tell your colleagues how you love to sing and describe your favorite karaoke bar. Someone else then might share details about her own hobby, and soon the team will have a much stronger, healthier relationship. In addition, we have a natural inclination to approach situations from a personal bias rather than taking a more objective stance. Of course, this can greatly damage our ability to communicate. One of the author’s students was studying for an important exam in his basement. He heard his six-year-old daughter knock at the door, despite having already told her not to interrupt him. Angry, he shouted for her to go upstairs, causing her to run off crying. The next day his wife told him that she had sent their daughter to the basement to say goodnight and to ask him if he wanted any coffee to help him study. If the student had simply adopted some humility and asked his daughter what she needed, he could have avoided becoming angry and scaring her! Let this be a lesson: always make sure you know what’s going on before rushing to judgment. The key message in this book: Good communication relies on good relationships. The practice of humble inquiry helps you demonstrate trust as well as interest in your conversation partner, which, taken together, acts as the underpinnings of a solid, meaningful relationship.

Probably not. In all the areas of business, personnel management is considered the least sexy of roles. This attitude often leads to HR becoming the “forgotten zone,” with managers apathetic about its activities, as long as they’re not too expensive. Yet HR is one the most important elements in the profitability of a business. The bottom line: companies that constantly improve their personnel strategies do better than those companies that ignore them.   These blinks show you just how important human resources can be and how you can make your company’s HR department as strong as possible. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you need a LAMP to shine a light on human resources; how you can make your employees healthier people; and how one visionary manager doubled employee pay and increased profits. The importance of human resources as a key driver of a company’s success is acknowledged but rarely appreciated. Any manager knows it’s important to have and maintain good employees. But could you, if pressed, articulate what’s good and what’s not about your own personnel management strategies? Many managers can’t, and continue to fumble with HR, for better or often, worse. The fact is that human resources is a crucial element in determining whether your company will grow and thrive. Why then, do we so often value HR not on its effectiveness but solely on whether it’s efficient? You might easily see the connection between effective marketing and revenues, but teasing out the link between HR and financial success is trickier. Because of this, business leaders are largely indifferent to human resources issues, and only assess strategies with regard to cost efficiency. But the advantages of good HR are plain to see. Companies depend on both the quality and commitment of employees. The Hay Group’s “World's Most Admired Companies” list even shows that companies that treat their people as valuable assets are as a rule more successful. It's paramount to make the connection between decisions regarding human resources and a company’s financial performance visible and understandable. But what’s the best method for doing so? One powerful option is to use the LAMP framework, an acronym that stands for logic, analytics, measure and process. LAMP is about understanding the logic behind a problem, finding the correct ways to measure it, analyzing the data and creating a process to respond to the issues you’ve discovered. Want to learn how to shine your own LAMP on your HR processes? Read on for more. When a company wants to measure success, what does it do? Most companies will simply look to data. But if all you do is crunch numbers, you’ll miss out on some deeper issues. To start making better decisions, you need to look at the issues behind the numbers. First establish a clear, logical framework – the “L” in LAMP – starting with identifying the causes and the consequences of certain problems at your company. Consider absenteeism. By just looking at numbers, all you’ll discover is that often, employees get sick. But studies have shown that in the United States, only 35 percent of absenteeism can be explained by personal illness. So you’ll need to look a little deeper. Family issues, stress, personal issues or even a mentality of entitlement are just some of the factors that can contribute to a high absentee rate. But how these elements are significant will remain obscured if you don’t establish a logical framework to help you understand the gravity of the problem. For example, a logical framework for absenteeism could look like this: employees aren’t at work to complete their jobs; other employees have to fill in, which either reduces overall productivity or results in work not getting done at all. Less work completed of course means higher costs for you! So by reducing absenteeism, you’ll reduce costs. Isn’t it logical now that you need to get to the bottom of absenteeism? By using the LAMP framework, you ensure that you’re shining a light on the right problem in your overall human resources strategy. With your problem now in view, it’s time to start measuring. If you ever tackled a college thesis paper, you know the challenges of sifting through tons of data. But only once you have all the necessary data, can you start the real work of analysis and writing. Data without analysis – “A” in LAMP – doesn’t make a good thesis, nor does it make a good HR strategy. Be wary of jumping to conclusions too soon, as a quick look at the data might mislead you into making a false insight. Such mistakes can cost you! Say you’ve been given data that shows that stores with happy, cheerful employees correlate to higher sales. You might decide to try to reproduce this correlation in other stores by starting a training program to improve employee attitudes. The program will be expensive, but if it boosts sales, the effort is worth it. Right? Not quite. A proper analysis might have shown that employee morale is high in certain stores only because customers there belong to a demographic that spends more. If this was the case, your expensive training program wouldn’t impact sales at all – it would just be expensive. So do a proper analysis before you jump into action. But don’t be fooled – detailed analysis is often a complex process and can only be conducted by specialists. It's nevertheless essential that all HR leaders have a basic understanding of analytical methods.   HR managers need to stay up-to-date on best practices by reading relevant publications regularly. Your HR chief should also ensure that any specialists you hire know all the necessary background information for your company, such as why structures are the way they are, why certain staff members work like they do, and perhaps why any changes have not been enacted before. From punctuality to turnover, there is a whole range of metrics for human resources. But as a manager, you’ll learn nothing without a good grasp of your problem’s context. Decreasing employee turnover, for example, seems like a worthy goal. Your employees will be overall more experienced, and you’ll spend less time and money finding and training replacements. Yet measuring turnover rates alone won’t give you much insight. If you want to decrease the rate of turnover, the simplest way would be to lower the required skill level for company positions. More candidates will apply for jobs, and those hired will be more desperate to stay in the job, given the competition. But is this good strategy? Of course not! You can’t build a better strategy on one simple data point. If you want to understand the issue at hand, you’ll have to measure – the “M” in LAMP – meticulously. To tackle a turnover problem more effectively, consider calculating turnover rates by department and by position. By measuring in a targeted manner, you’ll soon find far more interesting results. You might conclude that a high turnover rate hurts the company only when it applies to higher-level positions. But rapid turnover might actually be beneficial lower in your company’s hierarchy, as after all, new employees earn less money and can take fewer holidays. Knowing this, you could improve the conditions for those more valuable positions and dedicate fewer resources to the rest. But will this keep employees happy? That's a separate question. But with a good grasp of logical frameworks, analysis and measurement tools, you’re well on your way to solving your HR problems. Now it’s time to examine the process of how to make these problems go away. After all that hard work in researching HR problems, you need to make sure the company benefits from your new insights. In other words, company managers need to get on board to make your new HR processes a success. If you want your insights to shape decisions and conduct, you or your HR managers have to keep in mind that each company branch has its own priorities and focus. For a sales team, sales numbers obviously are of paramount importance. The production department, on the other hand, is more interested in efficiency and reducing waste. Team managers therefore have different knowledge frameworks, with which they process and understand information in light of their job priorities. A salesman will be glued to his seat if you’re introducing a new program guaranteed to increase sales. Yet if you focus on how the program is equally important for customer welfare, you might lose your sales team’s attention. When you want your managers to actively engage, you need to communicate with them in a manner that best suits their knowledge framework. Build on what your team already knows. For example, managers focus a lot of their energies on profitability and costs. Why not start your HR pitch using an analysis that focuses on the costs of poor procedure? In doing so, you’ll grab their attention. After they’re hooked, you can introduce some of your more complex analytical tools that might be less familiar. As an example, start by outlining a basic turnover-cost analysis to your audience. This will help those managers not in HR to understand the direct link between decisions made in HR and the company’s bottom line. Once you’ve made this breakthrough, you can get into the finer details to explain the logical, measured analysis you’ve performed and in doing so, help each team better grasp why the new strategy is a win for them! It’s a worker’s nightmare. A coworker falls ill, and suddenly, all her work is on your plate, too. It’s high time that companies pay more attention to health at work! The largest share of health-care costs – some 75 percent – actually stems from a small number of diseases strongly related to lifestyle choices: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Promoting healthy behavior can help prevent many of these ailments, from exercising regularly to help fend off cardiovascular disease to maintaining a healthy diet to avoid diabetes and obesity. A company can reduce both direct and indirect health-care costs by supporting efforts to encourage employees to choose healthier lifestyles. Take Pitney Bowes, for example. This large software company did its research and came to the conclusion that employees suffering from high blood-pressure issues were having a big impact on the company’s overall health-care costs. The company thus decided to cover the costs of blood pressure medication for employees that needed it. And in doing so, Pitney Bowes saw a marked reduction in health-related emergencies and absenteeism, not to mention an increase in productivity. Pitney Bowes isn’t an isolated case. A Towers-Watson study in 2009 revealed that high-performing companies invested significantly more in the health of their employees than did less-successful companies. Aside from cutting costs, there’s another benefit to looking after your company’s health: employees are far more likely to feel loyal to their employer when they feel cared for. In this way, strengthening the health of employees will strengthen a company itself! In January 1914, Henry Ford cut the work day for his employees to eight hours and increased the daily minimum wage to $5, almost double its previous level. People thought Ford had gone mad. But his pro-employee decision proved successful, as workers performed better and worked harder as a result. Ford knew just how much employee attitude affected productivity, as it still does today. Studies done between 1998 and 2000 revealed that companies with positive employee attitudes have long-term returns of 82 percent, while companies with negative employee attitudes had 37 percent. Food retailer SYSCO’s in-house consultants found a high correlation between employee attitude and pre-tax earnings. This is because happy, motivated employees are far more likely to accept and adapt to innovation, meaning a company can constantly improve its offerings. Happy employees can reduce costs, too. Fortune magazine's list of the \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" all receive twice as many job applications than do other companies, while turnover rates are half that of the competition. This saves companies a lot of money in both recruitment and training. SYSCO also considers employee quality-of-life issues, by offering services such as child care. Additionally, employees with SYSCO’s subsidiaries do a self-assessment once a year. The top-performing companies always score higher in a few key measurements, such as \"upper management spends time talking with employees about our business direction\" or \"my supervisor treats me with dignity and respect.” This demonstrates SYSCO’s ability to ensure that a strong company culture is a priority at all levels. Some employees are “married” to their jobs. But for many, life is more than just a career. Importantly, work-life programs are on the rise. So how exactly can such programs help your company? The aim of work-life programs is to help employees find a balance between employment responsibilities and personal life. As the structure of work has changed radically in recent decades, so too have the needs of employees. Almost as many women as men are now in the workforce, with some 80 percent of couples dual earners. Without a stay-at-home parent, child care has become a more difficult business. Studies have shown that the generation born between 1979 and 1994 places great importance on flexible work schedules, a work-life balance and altruistic principles. They're not just fixated on a higher pay package. This means that companies can no longer rely on pay alone as an incentive. More and more college-educated employees wait longer to have children, worrying that parenthood will interrupt or even damage their careers. And because professionals are often working autonomously and not just from 9-to-5, their need for flexible arrangements is significant. Work-life programs are a win-win solution for companies and employees, leading to better financial results and decreased costs. Research has shown that the best predictor for employee health and satisfaction is a good work-life balance. Work-life programs, therefore, lead to decreased turnover and absenteeism rates. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), for example, has made significant investments in work-life programs and consequently has the lowest voluntary turnover rate in the whole industry, at just two percent! SAS has grown each year since its founding 34 years ago, and in 2009, it achieved revenues of $2.31 billion. So we can see how a better quality of life for employees can lead to better business!

If the signs are perfect, no one will notice. That’s the nature of the work done by Invisibles: it’s done so well that we can’t see it. Invisibles work hard because they want to feel satisfied that they’ve done a good job, not because they want money or fame. Even though we often can’t see these people, our society rests on them. Unfortunately, we’re in the midst of some very negative societal changes. In our digital age, people are encouraged to seek fame and attention. They want external recognition for their work – the exact opposite of what Invisibles want. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the critical role Invisibles play, and what we need to do to give them the value they deserve. You’ll also learn why people who get less attention for their work are happier; why the creator of one of the most famous perfumes in the world didn’t want recognition; how attention and praise can negatively affect your performance; why Invisibles thrive more in Asian and African cultures; and how we can improve society by drawing inspiration from Invisibles. In our modern world, we’re constantly surrounded by “noise.” Whether it’s the crushing soundtrack of a film, the ever-present blaring of cellphones, or the millions of opinions posted online each day, our world is getting noisier by the minute. To stand out in this intense and chaotic environment, we perpetually have to shout – both literally and figuratively. People use online social networks to broadcast their thoughts to everyone. Anyone seeking media exposure now views their own life and thoughts as a brand to promote: nothing is too personal to share with the world. Facebook and Twitter, for example, are designed for people to share personal information. Apps like Foursquare even encourage us to share our current locations, and many people do so without thinking. This ever-present noise is tipping our society dangerously out of balance. In the last few centuries, successful nations have always had a healthy balance of working people. On one side, there are the silent and determined people who drive the economy and other elements of society. They’re satisfied with doing good work, even if they don’t get public praise for it. On the other side, there are people in the spotlight. They might be celebrities in Hollywood, the entertainment industry or the media. These are the people who are known for what they do, and they’re equally important for keeping the balance. However, modern society now encourages us to be more like the latter group. Everyone’s compelled to stand out as a great individual, and everyone wants recognition. We want to be the lead singer, not the technician behind the scenes. The people who work “quietly” to make things better for everyone are becoming fewer and fewer, and this has some very unfortunate implications. Invisibles are the exact opposite of what our noisy world is pushing us toward. They’re the quiet backbone of society. Invisibles are people who do exceptional work, but try to avoid getting too much praise for it. We can’t function properly without Invisibles, but we don’t pay much attention to them. In fact, we usually don’t notice them at all, or even realize that their jobs exist. Invisibles are people who are highly skilled and meticulous. They can be found in any field. They might be the fact checker for the New York Times, or the traffic controller at the airport. Invisibles are the opposite of what many people feel compelled to become today. They focus on the grunt work that’s needed for finishing projects, rather than the fame they could earn afterward. Actually, they usually feel uncomfortable if they receive any kind of public praise. The famous perfumer, David Apel, is a good example of an Invisible. He created some of the best-known smells in the world. He worked for months on the perfume Unforgivable by P. Diddy, and when it was released and sold out immediately, he was pleased to not receive public attention for it. Instead, he basked in the feeling of have done such a great job. When a person does something well, they should be showered with praise and reward, shouldn’t they? Well, perhaps not. Although we have a tendency to commend someone when they do something well, reward systems and other external factors actually decrease a person’s performance. Even in school, we assume that children are motivated to work hard because they want As. But in fact, research has shown that children do better in school when they aren’t pressured by external measurements like grades. A psychologist named Sam Glucksberg led one of the most famous studies on this topic. He conducted various experiments where groups of participants worked on small projects, either for money or for no reward at all. He studied the ways that the potential for reward affected the participants’ ability to do their tasks. Interestingly, he found that there was a tremendous difference between the two groups. The prospect of monetary reward actually decreased the participants’ performance. When they knew they could receive money for their work, the participants narrowed their focus on their projects. They were less creative and took fewer risks, wanting to stick to the most reliable way of earning the money. Creativity, however, is absolutely essential when looking for innovative ways to solve new problems. Invisibles aren’t always completely indifferent to external reward, but that reward is just a side benefit to them. They’ll still get some outside recognition, like respect from their co-workers, but their primary motivation is always their internal desire to see their jobs well done. Dennis Poon, the lead structural engineer for the Shanghai Tower, is another example of an Invisible. When the tower is complete, he won’t get nearly as much attention as the architect. Instead, he’ll feel rewarded when the skyscraper withstands strong winds and earthquakes, because he isn’t in it for the fame. So what’s the most important trait of Invisibles? Well, they’re very meticulous, meaning that they’re extremely careful and precise about their work. They want to complete their tasks perfectly. After all, this is part of what leads to their invisibility: if you do a job perfectly, no one will notice. Although you can find Invisibles in vastly different fields of work, one thing they all have in common is that they’re very proud of their attention to detail. You can see this commonality in the people managing the technology at a rock concert, the engineers of a suspension bridge, or the anesthesiologist in an operation: they’re all paying close attention to every detail of their work. They’re all very conscientious. Invisibles need every detail to be perfect, because they can’t stand it if the quality of their work is compromised in any way. Dennis Poon, for example, never skimps on the details of his structures, even when he’s pressured to cut costs or have his buildings finished earlier. Instead, he needs every detail to be exactly what he wants. If anything is out of place, he won’t be satisfied. Meticulousness is what helps Invisibles stay so hidden. They know that their projects need to be perfect, or else people will notice them, and they aren’t hoping to be noticed. If they produce anything with a flaw, it will draw attention to them and their work. If their project is flawless, they can stay in the background. There’s a good way to test if someone has been painstaking. If you don’t stop to wonder who was behind a certain job, that means they did their work very well. In addition to meticulousness, there’s another common trait all Invisibles have. They enjoy having responsibility. In fact, they thrive on it, and will often seek out high positions in their field. Even when Invisibles are well-trained, experienced, and respected for what they do, they still strive to be better. Many qualified workers have mundane and practically “invisible” jobs, but they hate them with a passion. This is not the case for Invisibles. They’re often highly trained and revered experts in their fields. Radiohead’s guitar technician, Plank, is a good example of an Invisible. He’s been with the band since they started over 20 years ago, and he’s the most trusted member of the group. He’s responsible for Thom Yorke’s guitars, and still helps other crew members set up the concerts so that no mishaps occur. Because they’re so qualified, Invisibles often feel the need to take on more responsibility. Just because they don’t want public recognition doesn’t mean they’re fine with always playing the underdog. Invisibles usually end up with leading positions in their area of expertise, although we might not notice them. In TV, for example, we see shows like Grey's Anatomy that focus on surgeons or superstar doctors who single-handedly control the operating theaters and save the patients. In reality, this is far from the truth. Anesthesiologists are actually the ones who direct the operation, and the surgeons go to them if they need any help. Anesthesiologists must monitor all the surgical procedures, although they won’t be the ones to get credit in the end. The surgeons typically receive the most praise, although the invisible anesthesiologists don’t mind, because they don’t work for praise. Their reward is being the leader, and fulfilling their responsibilities in a way they can be proud of. Every culture in the world has its own strengths and weaknesses. Each also has it’s own values, so naturally, invisibles are valued quite differently depending on their cultural environment. One of the most prominent differences between Western and Asian societies is the emphasis placed on individuality. This has big implications for Invisibles in either culture. In Western societies, people are encouraged to be individuals. From a very young age, Westerners are taught to stick up for themselves, stand out, and be independent. This kind of behavior is looked down upon in many Asian or African societies. In a place like Japan, the role of the individual is more to act like a supporting “column” holding up the community as a whole. This means that in Western countries, people are often competitive in their workplaces. They want to stand out to the boss and secure promotions, even if that means putting down their colleagues. In non-Western countries, people are typically less competitive at work. They’re more focused on helping the company advance as a whole, even if that means sacrificing their own personal advancement. So, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Invisibles are much more common in Asian cultures. Conscientiousness, responsibility, and other common traits of Invisibles are highly valued in Japanese culture, for instance. There are many examples of invisible jobs in Japan. Some are traditional, like the artisans who make calligraphy brushes, and some are modern, like the creators of manga and anime. Most people with jobs like this will never be famous, but they still find quiet happiness in the quality and beauty of their work. Japanese companies are also more supportive of Invisibles. They often try to acknowledge and support people who aren’t in leadership positions. Some companies even have days where high-level leaders take the time to recognize and appreciate their workers. So now that we’ve seen how Invisibles work, what does this mean for us? What does it mean for our future? We’re in need of a change. Our society is drifting off track, and we need to direct it back on course. The financial crisis has already been a painful sign that something is terribly wrong. Banks gamble away our money, and everyone’s in competition with each other. A new kind of dog-eat-dog society is emerging. In response to this, we spend most of our time trying to brand ourselves by sharing our lives on social media networks. Even our social media usage has become competitive: we want to show we’re more interesting than anyone else. We used to value high-quality work, but we now prefer quick fame and wealth. Our current obsession with micro-celebrities will only harm us in the long run. More and more people will stop seeking a good education or job. Instead, they’ll strive to be YouTube celebrities or get-rich-quick bankers. What we truly need is inspiration from Invisibles. More of us must take on their qualities, especially by putting aside our own personal advancement. If we focus less on getting attention, and more on improving society, we might be able to make significant changes. The focus on individuality has been an important part of American history, and it certainly has it’s own place and time. However, it’s starting to become too much. We need to distance ourselves from our individualism, and work to be more humble and reserved. If we place less emphasis on ourselves, we can get back on track with improving our society. If we can rekindle our appreciation of high-quality jobs that give workers more fulfillment, we can steer through our noisy world and make it out safely in the end. The key message in this book: Society is held together by Invisible people who pull the strings without us noticing, and we need them to function. Unfortunately, we’re in the midst of a crisis: these days, everyone is being pushed away from this valuable “Invisibility.” We need to recalibrate our support for Invisibles if we want to improve our noisy world. Actionable advice: Looking for a new job? Ask yourself what’s more important: happiness or attention? It might seem like you’ll work harder if you know a promotion might be on the horizon, but actually, internal motivations are more important. Do something you have passion for, and work to please yourself – not others. Not only will you feel more satisfied, the quality of your work will be higher.

When did your company start claiming to be your family instead of your coworkers? Authors Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founders of the successful software company Basecamp – answer these questions and more, and also provide a much-needed antidote to some of the crazy hallmarks of the modern workplace. Instead of pushing yourself to work longer hours, meet tight deadlines and see the competition as your mortal enemy, it’s time to discover a calmer way of doing things. In these blinks, you’ll learn the difference between working hard and working smart. You’ll see why a successful, profitable company isn’t just compatible with a good work-life balance, but actually benefits from it. Join two renegades of the corporate world who aren’t afraid to call out our exploitative, unsustainable working culture. In these blinks, you’ll discover the reasons why you need to start treating your company like a product; ways to fit all your work into an eight-hour day; and an approach to bringing calm to your office for good. How many times have you burst through your front door after a long day, collapsed on the sofa and exclaimed, “It’s so crazy at work!” Unfortunately, in our modern era of long hours, early starts and weekend work sessions, this scenario can be a nightly occurrence. Welcome to the workaholic world, in which 70 to 80-hour weeks have somehow become the norm. What’s the end result of this crazy working culture? Unfortunately, it’s not higher productivity. More often than not, all the extra hours you spend at your desk aren’t spent on work that’s vital. Instead, they’re frittered away in a haze of anxiety and distractions brought about by the demands of new technologies and endless meetings. In fact, the real outcome of long and hectic work days is added stress. This stress originates in the culture of our workplaces. Unhealthy workplace culture starts from the top and is handed down to managers, their subordinates and even the company’s customers. So, what’s the solution? How can organizations stop stress, change their culture and still maintain profitability? Well, the authors believe it all begins with changing the way you view your company. To begin with, you should start looking at it like a product, and treating it accordingly. Though this might seem like a crazy idea, look at it this way: If your company produces products, the company itself is also a tool - one that is used to make those products. Bearing that in mind, there are certain questions any good product manager should ask himself. Is your company simple for employees to use, or is it complicated? Where is it fast, and where is it slow? Does your company have any bugs that need fixing? Just as the best companies never stop trying to make their products as good as possible, a product manager with a curious mindset is continually searching for places to make improvements in company culture. And once you start searching, brace yourself - there will definitely be room for improvement. Indeed, organizations often share one very important trait with software. That trait? They both tend to have areas in which they crash, due to either faulty design or oversights on the part of the developer. Luckily, you’re about to discover how you can phase out the crazy and usher in an atmosphere of lasting calm in your company. Social media may be a valuable tool for keeping up with friends, new ideas and the latest cat videos, but unfortunately, it’s also a bottomless well of workaholic sentiment. Just consider the comments you see associated with #entrepreneur on social media, which include, “Extreme talent isn’t necessary, but extreme commitment is!” or “Conquer your competition!” Comments like these are made for the virtual world, but they often reflect attitudes that can have dramatic real-world consequences. One such attitude, which is propagated on social media and repeated in many offices, is that success can’t be attained without excessive hard work. But this simply isn’t true. After all, you may be putting in 18-hour days to make your entrepreneurial dreams a reality, but is that all-important brainwave going to hit you when you’re exhausted and burnt out? Probably not. In fact, the mundane truth is that progress and innovation are rarely achieved with blunt force. Instead, they are built brick by brick, week after week. Just consider Charles Darwin, the legendary evolutionary scientist. He wrote 19 books in his lifetime, including the seminal On the Origin of Species, and never worked more than four and a half hours per day. Another unhelpful idea, voiced both online and offline, is that the business world is like a war zone. This attitude is reinforced by the tendency to use the language of battle in business. Competitors are ‘conquered,’ companies describe their sales department as a ‘force’ rather than a team and new employees aren’t recruited, they’re ‘headhunted.’ Unfortunately, while these analogies might make life a little more exciting for office warriors, they also create a toxic workplace culture. After all, the entrepreneur who fancies herself a military leader and the competition ‘the enemy’ will find justification for engaging in unethical behavior and commercial skulduggery. So, what’s the solution to this problematic paradigm of war? Well, the authors think it’s pacifism. Instead of trying to dominate your competitors, look to your own business. Ask yourself if you’re making the amount of profit you need to meet your needs. Is that profit increasing year after year? If the answer is yes, you can rest as easy as a contented pacifist – no warmongering required. As co-founders of the successful software company Basecamp, the authors have done something almost unheard of in this day and age – they’ve given their employees an eight-hour work day. This might not sound that radical, but for many modern bosses eight hours isn’t nearly long enough. This is pretty crazy when you think about it. After all, eight hours is the same length as many long-haul flights, and they seem to take forever! So, why doesn’t eight hours at work feel as long as an intercontinental flight? And moreover, why doesn’t a 40-hour week feel long enough to get all your work done? Well, the hours we spend on an intercontinental flight are typically uninterrupted and hold few distractions. In contrast, the modern workplace provides us with a stream of interruptions in the form of emails, instant messenger chats, meetings or even bosses visiting your desk. The work day is punctuated by constant demands for our attention, and so it seems to shrink down until putting in those extra hours begins to feel perfectly reasonable. So, how can you calm the craziness, get home on time and still get your work done? Well, the good news is that there is an answer. The bad news is that you can’t implement it alone. In fact, you need your company to start treating your time like they would their products, intellectual property and data. Quite simply, they need to protect it. Unfortunately, many companies treat their employees’ time and attention as if it were an infinite resource able to accommodate any number of activities or demands. But in today’s world, an individual’s attention is perhaps the scarcest commodity of all. Fortunately, not all companies get it so wrong. At the authors’ company, they value their employees’ time. In order to preserve it, they’ve eliminated the lengthy status-update meetings, which have become a weekly occurrence in offices all over the world. Instead of forcing teams to sit and listen to each other talk about their work, they’ve devised a more time-efficient way of keeping everyone informed. Each team member adds their weekly status update to the company’s eponymous software, and people can check this when it’s convenient for them. This system allows employees bigger chunks of interaction-free time during which they can focus on their important tasks. As a leader, you help set the tone of your company. For better or worse, your senior position means that subordinates will take their cue from you. With this in mind, you better make sure the beliefs and values you’re spreading around your workplace are the right ones. These days, its commonplace for companies to push the idea that their employees are all one big family. Although this kind of sentiment might make you feel warm and fuzzy, you’d be well advised to run as fast as you can in the other direction when you hear it. Why? Because, frankly, it’s garbage. A company is not a family – it’s simply a group of people who work together to make things happen. This isn’t to say that coworkers can’t look after each other, but that’s a far cry from being family. After all, most families love one another unconditionally and will go to any lengths to protect each other. So why do so many organizations use this inaccurate analogy? Unfortunately, it’s often a cynical ploy to persuade employees to put in more hours at the office. By associating themselves with the idea of family, organizations are subtly priming their workers to make personal sacrifices in favor of work. The aim is to convince their employees that burning the midnight oil, working weekends and forgoing vacations aren’t questions of overtime, but of helping the family. If they can be tricked into this way of thinking, then employees might be persuaded to put aside their natural self-interest or subordinate their own needs and, ironically, the needs of their real families, to those of the company. Rather than calling your business a family, call it a business that helps families. This means letting your employees leave work at a decent hour each day, so they have time to eat dinner with their children. It means allowing your workers ample time off for vacations and providing a fulfilling workplace so that your colleagues can go off to their real families, happy and contented at the end of every day. Producing good work can be a stressful undertaking, especially when high standards come into play. But what about when it’s not the work itself that’s putting you under strain, but the processes that surround it? Even if striving to give your best will always be a little stressful, you can still make the process of doing so as calm as possible. Let’s take a look at one process that sends anxiety levels soaring in offices everywhere – meeting deadlines. Or, as the authors call them, dreadlines. Although setting a timeline for a project seems simple enough, things can get crazy when unreasonable expectations are involved. Many of us have had the unpleasant experience of having too much to do with too little time allocated, or of having projects expand in scope while their deadlines remain the same. Fortunately, there’s an easy way to take the dread out of deadlines for good. At the authors’ company, for example, they have a strict policy when it comes to the scope of time-sensitive projects. Namely, the scope of an ongoing project can never get bigger. In other words, once you get started, no one can increase the amount of work you have before a particular deadline. Moreover, the person meeting the deadline has the power to shrink the scope of the project, if necessary, to get it finished in time. Playing by these rules, no one in the company has to worry about missing deadlines at all. Another process that many companies could change is how employees introduce new ideas. In most organizations, it’s standard to convene a face-to-face meeting for presenting new concepts. Someone stands at the front of a room and speaks about the ideas they’ve been working on before receiving feedback. The problem with this approach is that instead of encouraging listeners to absorb this new information, it merely encourages them to react to it. And really, how useful is an ad-hoc reaction when the listener hasn’t had time to reflect? That’s why, at the authors’ company, new ideas are never presented face-to-face. Instead, they’re written down and uploaded to the company’s Basecamp software for colleagues to read privately. Crucially, everyone is encouraged to sleep on what they’ve read and think it over before reacting. Thus, when they finally do give feedback, it’s likely they’ll have taken as much time to consider the new idea as the coworker who pitched it in the first place. In Silicon Valley and beyond, entrepreneurs are disciples to the belief that big rewards cannot be achieved without an equally huge gamble. And unsurprisingly, this habitual risky behavior can lead to a lot of workplace craziness. What may be more surprising is that being too risk-averse can also lead to stress and anxiety in the office. In fact, when it comes to risk, it’s all about balance. The authors believe that their company’ has this balance just right. How? Well, they take risks, but they don’t take unmitigated risks. One recent risk, for instance, was to increase the monthly cost of their eponymous software from $29 to $99. Sounds pretty risky, right? And what’s more, they carried out zero market research beforehand to check how customers might feel about this new pricing. So, how did they mitigate this risk? Crucially, they didn’t raise the price for existing clients, only for potential new ones. They provided new software updates to their existing customers without increasing their price plan. So even if the new pricing disastrously reduced the number of new customer sign-ups, they could still rely on their approximately 100,000 existing clients. In other words, the authors took a risk, but it was calculated and easily reversed. Counterintuitively, being overly cautious about risk can also lead to soaring stress and anxiety in the workplace. Many companies, for instance, want to implement change but get stuck in a state of paralysis. Why? Well, they get fixated on eliminating any element of risk or uncertainty surrounding the change. Consequently, they embark on lengthy quests for predictive information. If, for example, they want to introduce a new product, they quiz potential clients about their level of interest, set up focus groups and conduct surveys. As a result, the whole company becomes mired in doubt and indecision. The solution to this problem is simple – just do it already. Real information will only be discovered if customers actually, not hypothetically, interact with a new product or change. Careful testing is merely a simulation and can only provide possible outcomes. Take a deep breath, make the change and let the market resolve your uncertainty. In hectic modern life, with the demands and expectations of others buzzing around, it’s easy to forget that you always have a choice when it comes to how you behave, what you prioritize and how you treat those around you. You may well have an exacting boss or a difficult client, but you’re still the captain of your own ship. What’s more, the individual choices you make determine whether your working environment is stressful or calm. One of the most important of these choices is the manner in which you treat your customers, specifically those who come to you with a problem. Jean-Louis Gassée, the former Head of Apple France, wisely stated that when it comes to handling customer complaints, there are two possible options. You can treat the complaint as highly important or you can shrug your shoulders and deem it trivial. Whatever position you choose to take, your customer will choose the other. That means that you’d better take every customer complaint seriously, because if you don’t the customer will. Let’s take a look at this dynamic in practice. Imagine that you’re a hotel manager whose guests complain that their room is too hot. If you shrug your shoulders, your guests are likely to angrily double-down on their grievance and make even more of a fuss. In other words, their complaint will take on even more importance in their minds. But if you apologize profusely, demonstrably share your concern and pledge to do everything in your power to correct this dreadful mistake, your guests will backtrack from their original outrage and assure you that it’s not that huge a problem after all. So, the next time a customer complains, remember to choose the right attitude. If you don’t, you’re forcing them to up the ante and ultimately burdening yourself with more conflict. Furthermore, you don’t have to be in a leadership position to shun craziness and choose serenity. Whatever your role, you still have a locus of control – a sphere of influence around you, to which you can introduce some calm. Within this area, however narrow, you have the power to improve your communication style with customers, redesign your interactions with colleagues and regain control over your own time. The key message in these blinks: Don’t fall for the popular rhetoric surrounding the modern workplace. Instead of pushing yourself to work more hours and bending over backward to meet unrealistic deadlines, focus on working smarter. By fiercely guarding your time and making your processes more efficient, you can get home on time and never again utter the words “It’s crazy at work!”  Actionable advice: Model a great work-life balance.  If you’re a boss that’s always telling your employees to take holidays, leave the office at a decent hour and take time off when they’re ill, then here’s a tip – take a look at your own behavior, too. After all, your subordinates are much more likely to follow your example than do as you say. If you’re always working weekends instead of taking your family on vacation, then your workers will assume that’s what is expected of them, no matter what you say. So if you want to improve the work-life balance in your office, make sure your own is in good shape first. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Hess","summary":"Established business leaders know that being able to learn is a key to success. But what does this mean? Being able to learn means improving and growing your skills – and in doing so, staying ahead of the pack. An individual can learn; yet the bigger challenge is getting an entire organization to keep learning. In today’s fast-paced business world, we either learn, or die. These blinks give you insight into the latest research that explains how our brains work – that is, exactly how we learn – and how you can then use this knowledge to reevaluate how your company operates. You’ll learn how to build a successful, dynamic organization based on how the human mind works. That’s bad news for your competitors, and great news for your employees and bottom line! In these blinks, you’ll discover how Toyota deals with employee mistakes; why you need a comfortable chair to learn effectively; and how to think as quickly as a firefighter. We learn as we observe the results of cause and effect in our environment. When dark clouds gather overhead, for example, you know through past observation that it may rain. Over time, such observations become a way of interpreting the world. Our learning systems are somewhat like a computer operating system – that takes more work to rewrite. Yet it’s precisely our ability to rewrite what we’ve learned that is the key to productive learning. The human learning machine consumes lots of energy, and because of this, tends to operate more often than not on autopilot – relying on instinct – to conserve fuel. We call this mode System 1. It’s in this mode that you, for example, keep your voice down inside rather than yell and scream, based on the hard lessons you learned as a child. Sometimes this mode can blind you, however. When you really need to think out of the box, such as when you’re trying to figure out why a competitor’s product is crushing yours in the market, you need to switch your thinking to System 2. The ultimate goal of a learning organization is to overcome the preference for System 1 thinking. To do so, learning organizations must help employees to process information, especially information that challenges automatic assumptions. System 1 thinking isn’t a problem with basic activities. Yet in business, it can cause you to miss trends or opportunities. A company stuck in System 1 thinking often can’t see alternatives to the status quo. In contrast, System 2 thinking helps you reject automatic responses; instead, you’re able to consider new options and temper any bias. Observing and managing the way you think is essential to actual learning. One way to get in the habit of using System 2 thinking is to simply reflect on what you’ve done during the day. This will help you to identify critical moments in which System 2 thinking could have helped. Throughout the process, remember to keep an open mind so you can turn mistakes into learning opportunities. We often – yet erroneously – separate our rational, thinking mind from our emotional mind. The truth, however, is that thinking is impossible without emotion. The areas of the brain responsible for emotions and thinking are closely networked, and even overlap. Star Trek’s highly logical Spock is, after all, a fictional character. In reality, there’s no such thing as completely logical thought. Your emotions will always affect your thoughts, and vice versa. Consider how your emotions can color your memories. Or your “gut” intuition, which isn’t really a thought or a feeling, but more a mixture of the two. Your mind, brain and body all communicate, and what is communicated affects each organ in turn. That’s why when you hurt yourself or are stressed, for example, both your thinking and your ability to learn is compromised. But that doesn’t mean that the quality of your thinking is completely out of your control. Not all emotions disrupt thinking, as we know from our evolutionary past. While negative emotions activate self-preserving behaviors, such as our fight-or-flight instinct, positive emotions enhance cognitive processing through thinking and learning, increasing awareness, exploration and creativity. So rather than rejecting your emotions, you should embrace the ones that enhance how you learn. Smiling more, expressing gratitude and reflecting on the good things in life give you a positive outlook that can ease the learning process. But managing emotions isn’t easy. Negative emotions can limit your comprehension and trigger a fear response, hijacking other functions of the brain and thus undermining your ability to change perspectives or behaviors. When we’re afraid, we become obsessed with that fear, and in turn can’t use our minds fully. You can combat fear by reframing a situation into one that isn’t so scary. For instance, if you’re afraid to deliver a presentation to the board of directors, just view the talk as a learning opportunity – and you’ll be fine. So now you know how the process of learning works. The following blinks will examine tools and methods that foster learning. So now that you know how the human mind thinks and learns, it’s time to apply these lessons to your organization. Your goal is to make your team a High Performance Learning Organization (HPLO), a place where learning is praised as a key element for success. HPLOs need to achieve three key goals: finding the right people, creating the right environment and establishing the right processes. Let’s look first at how to find the right people. A learning organization needs people who have a learning mind-set, which is characterized by a genuine motivation to learn. Our basic need to survive led to the development of behavior centered around a decision to approach or avoid things. If a thing was dangerous, we avoided it. If not, we approached it. Whether or not we take risks and learn is likewise predicated on whether we’ve learned to approach or avoid the process of learning. For example, if you’ve been humiliated by a manager after trying something new, you probably will avoid taking risks in the future. An HPLO, in contrast, aims to bring people into the organization who are motivated to learn and to help others learn. Similarly, employees should have self-efficacy, or a belief in their ability to achieve. They should see problems as a challenge and an opportunity to learn, not as something to fear. A manager with self-efficacy can cope with a major product recall, for example, knowing that he can learn from the situation to avoid it in the future. There are many reasons to learn – some are internal, and others are external. People who want to master or expand their skills and welcome feedback are fueled by intrinsic motivations. That is, learning makes them feel good! Extrinsically motivated learners, on the other hand, seek the approval of others. They want to learn to get good grades, high pay or respect. Generally more competitive and egoistic, they don’t welcome challenges and try to avoid failure, really only wanting to confirm how smart they really are. It’s clear that the sort of learners HPLOs want and need are internally motivated learners! Once you’ve found the right people, you need to cultivate the kind of environment that helps them thrive – one that fosters learning. A positive learning environment recognizes learners as individuals and provides them with autonomy and control over their learning. Role models should send employees on a journey of discovery, and challenge them. They should inspire a learning mind-set and help people cope with the fear of failure, any stress or other inhibitors to learning. A positive learning environment is one in which team leaders are evaluated on their ability to care and nurture employees’ growth. Learning organizations use things like “360” reviews (in which employees rate managers) to set financial compensation for top management. A positive environment deconstructs hierarchies. Learned deference to parents, elders or teachers can affect our relationship with authority in the workplace. Employees are often afraid to speak up, and fear the threat of a bad performance review or being passed over for promotion. But a High Performance Learning Organization (HPLO) requires an environment in which employees are invited to share thoughts, and this is only possible when employees feel safe. For example, managers can praise courageous workers who speak up or show humility by admitting their failures. Toyota, for instance, encourages its employees to be honest regarding their mistakes, which can only happen if an employee knows that she won’t be punished. Employers should be motivated to create a positive learning environment, as a space that facilitates learning also leads to high employee engagement. Typically, companies promote high engagement by taking employees’ opinions into account, giving them the opportunity to do what they do best and recognizing them for doing good work. Together, this results in more respect, self-efficacy and a positive atmosphere, all of which encourage learning. Once you’ve found the right people and have created the right environment, it’s time for the third goal in creating a High Performance Learning Organization (HPLO): establishing the right processes. The right processes are built upon effective communication. After all, learning is a team effort! Remember System 1 and System 2 thinking? The same concept applies to conversation. Often, we allow System 1 thinking to take over during a chat. We simply look to validate our beliefs and self-image, and don’t actively seek to challenge or expand our perspective. You can see clearly that System 1 thinking isn’t a recipe for learning. If you approach a conversation with a System 2 mind-set, you’ll ensure that your talk is open and honest. You should question everything, and learn from your conversation partner. In the workplace, we learn when we admit we’re wrong, or when we suspend judgment regarding others’ opinions. Unfortunately we live in a culture that values telling over asking, in that we’d much prefer to offer our opinion than ask other people about their own thoughts. “Tellers” often assume that they are imparting valuable knowledge. Here is the message they’re actually delivering: “I’m smarter and know more than you.” Instead, engage in humble inquiry and switch to “asking.” By asking questions, you demonstrate to your colleagues that you care about what they think and that you’re willing to listen and learn. To do this, you need to admit to yourself that you know much less than you think you know! Good conversations also require both a speaker and a listener to be engaged, and this means fighting distractions. Humans can cognitively process 600 words per minute, yet we speak at a rate of about 100 to 150 words per minute. As a result, we can get bored quickly. But clearly our conversation partners want us to pay attention! Give them peace of mind by letting them know that you’re present and are listening. Paraphrase their words back to them or ask for further explanation, for example. To readjust your view based on new facts – as is crucial for learning – you have to be able to conduct a critical analysis of new situations and information. Here are a few critical thinking tools that will help you improve your problem solving. First is the recognition-primed decision model. With this model, you compare your situation with situations from the past, identify which situations are most relevant to your current event and then apply the solution that worked then. This method is great when time is of the essence. For example, when a firefighter arrives at the scene of a fire, she has no time to weigh the pros and the cons of a multitude of actions. Instead, she’ll think back to a few fires she successfully fought to see what she could apply to her current situation. She’ll consider the characteristics of the fire, the layout of the building and the surrounding environment to determine quickly what to do. But some situations will be completely new, meaning you can’t rely on past solutions to tackle them. In such cases, use a pre-mortem analysis. Just as a doctor uses a post-mortem (after death) examination to determine how a patient died, using a pre-mortem approach gives you a chance to anticipate future events before they happen. When facing a situation, imagine a possible solution and then imagine that the solution was incorrect. Ask yourself, “What went wrong?” You can then examine the details that led to your hypothetical failure, and use that information to mitigate risks you might have initially overlooked. In the 1970s, planning teams from Shell Oil used a similar strategy to reduce overconfidence and prevent employees from getting tunnel vision when considering solutions. And finally, an insight process can help you discover new ideas. Slow down, suspend your judgment and ask yourself: Is there any data that contradicts my beliefs? Would a different perspective bring different answers? If I reframe my question, will I end up with a different set of answers? Are you ready to apply these lessons to your own organization? Let’s look at a couple of real-life examples and see how others have succeeded. Hedge fund Bridgewater uses drill downs to improve its learning environment. Essentially all conversations, meetings and interviews are recorded, and everyone has access. Sounds scary, right? Privacy implications aside, this strategy allows employee thinking and personal weaknesses to be easily reviewed. Colleagues can thus be brutally honest with each other and help each other improve. Sometimes business leaders may need to modify a business model or even company culture. Doing so requires a leader to establish new learning processes, and to think long and hard about how and at what level decisions are made. Accounting software solutions developer Intuit, when faced with a business slowdown, radically modified its approach by adopting design thinking – a methodology used by creatives to explore, discover and make new products. The company’s goal: to produce genuine innovation. To spread design thinking, Intuit empowered employees by giving them time to develop personal projects and by encouraging experimentation and rewarding the most promising ideas. Let’s say your company is already a market leader. You don’t need to change, but how do you preserve your position? Staying ahead means constantly reinventing your business while maintaining high levels of employee engagement. United Parcel Service (UPS) started with $100 and a bike. Each time the company expanded its services – from worldwide delivery, overnight shipping or air service – it faced hurdles that it turned into valuable lessons. UPS also transformed employee satisfaction into a science, spreading the company’s core values throughout its culture and rewarding employees with stock plans. As of 2012, UPS had a retention rate of some 90 percent! You’ll need to follow a path that’s right for your business. But whatever you decide, learning will be the engine that propels your organization toward success. The key message in this book: Individuals and organizations need to find a way to continuously learn and adapt or face professional obsolescence. But to learn well, individuals and organizations need to learn intelligently, and that means creating the conditions in which learning is easy and rewarded.

As a day laborer, he and many others wait on a street corner in Queens every morning for contractors to drive by and choose a few of them to do a day’s work at minimum wage. From the contractors’ point of view, all these workers are the same – they have no differentiating skills – so there is no special reason to pick Hector over any of the other laborers there. Hence, Hector will be lucky to get chosen. The industrial revolution was sparked by the discovery that highly skilled people are not necessarily needed to manufacture complicated products. Instead, almost any production process can be split into steps so simple that relatively unskilled workers can do them. Adam Smith wrote that ten barely trained – and hence poorly paid – factory workers could produce a thousand times more pins than one highly skilled pin maker. This is why many manufacturing jobs are simple, requiring only that employees show up and follow instructions precisely – like cogs in a machine. If you are such a worker, the problem is that you are easily replaceable and certainly in no position to negotiate a raise. Consider how manufacturing jobs in the West are being outsourced to China and India, where people are equally capable of following instructions but for a fraction of the cost. Today, even supposedly outsourcing-proof, white-collar jobs are under threat. Stock brokers, travel agents, secretaries and other professionals who were used to just showing up at work and doing what they were told are all finding themselves more and more replaceable and outsourceable. Jobs that involve purely following instructions can be done by anyone, anywhere. Today, if your job involves just following instructions, you are replaceable. There’s a big, grey mass of people out there for whom work means showing up for X hours a day in return for a monthly paycheck. They see their work as a frustrating and tedious chore, a necessary evil in their lives. And guess what? Their lack of motivation does not go unnoticed by management, and when times get tough, they are the first to be fired. This army of drones provides an opportunity for those who refuse to be unremarkable: the so-called linchpins, who are indispensable to their company. You need not be a CEO to be a linchpin. Consider the extra-friendly barista, whose great service makes you a regular customer, even though the coffee shop isn’t the closest or cheapest one. That barista is a linchpin, because the coffee shop can’t easily find someone with a similar passion for service to replace him with. Linchpins are like artists: they pour all their energy, heart and soul into their work. They don’t need detailed instructions from managers but rather find their own way of solving problems and doing their job. And they do this with such flare and passion that they gain a reputation. While others stand on the sidelines, linchpins stop the show. These abilities make linchpins not just slightly more valuable but a hundred times more valuable than the average mindless worker. Therefore, linchpins will always find work and be treated fairly – only a foolish company would lose one. And when a linchpin does look for a new job, usually her reputation has preceded her and she can count on employers to snag her up quickly. Linchpins are indispensable, so they get the best jobs. Becoming a linchpin means being brave enough to stand out of the crowd. But why is this so difficult? Why do most of us shy away from the limelight? The human brain evolved in stages, and one of the earliest parts to develop was the so-called lizard brain. It generates primal emotions like fear, hunger and anger, and it used to play a very important part in our survival; for example, by telling us to run away from saber-toothed tigers. Because this role was so important for our ancestors’ survival, the lizard brain still exerts a great deal of influence on our higher thinking. Today, however, the lizard brain’s influence can be damaging. When we’re supposed to stand up and give a speech, for example, the lizard brain goes berserk and fills us with fear. It screams: “No, don’t put yourself on stage where others can laugh at you, shout at you or attack you!” Similarly, if you’re trying to become an exalted, remarkable linchpin employee, the lizard brain will fill you with fear and doubt. It wants you to remain average, because this is the way it has survived until now; hiding from predators. It will probably even generate a wide variety of excuses for why you cannot be a linchpin, like: “You don’t have any good ideas!” “You don’t know what to do!” “Your boss would never let you!” Or even subtler: “Put off work for a bit, just procrastinate a little.” Basically, it will do everything it can to make sure your status quo doesn’t change into something new and scary. The lizard brain generates fear to stop you becoming a linchpin. In many ways, we are brought up to fit in. Consider school: we’re taught to prepare for exams, keep our heads down and follow instructions like, “Use #2 pencils.” Coloring outside the lines gets you a D, and not doing as you’re told gets you detention. Is it any wonder that by the time we reach a working age, we are afraid of doing anything that might make us stand out from the crowd? This is why most people are content to just show up at work and do what they are told. They are afraid of being special and afraid of ruining the safe and secure status quo. There are a number of ways you can try to abate fear. One is to stop indulging it. For example, if you’re afraid of your boss criticizing your work, you might constantly check your emails to see if he has sent you some negative feedback. Stop scratching this particular itch: force yourself to sit still and focus on something other than checking your emails. The fear will eventually recede. If you’re worried about failure, try pursuing multiple paths and setting multiple goals. If you line up three important presentations, failing in one will not matter so much and you will fear it less. Becoming a linchpin does not demand any particular natural talent or an Ivy League education. What it demands is that you overcome your fears and make a conscious choice to do so. Linchpins feel the same fear as everyone else, but they merely acknowledge it and move on; there’s work to be done. Don’t let your fear stop you – make the choice to be a linchpin. Not all artists are painters, sculptors or composers. Anyone who changes other people by giving them an emotional gift is an artist. A customer service person who uses his smile and charm to change an angry customer into a delighted fan of the company is just as much an artist as Picasso is. Similarly, the founder of online shoe store Zappos, Tony Hsieh, is an artist of great customer service. You can be an artist at your job, too, but not if you just show up and grudgingly do the bare minimum until it’s time to go home at the end of the day. Making art demands so-called emotional labor: investing your own emotions into your work to espouse creativity and generosity. It also means you have to make autonomous choices without clear instructions to follow. This is not easy, which is why many avoid it. For example, have you ever heard a flight attendant read out the safety announcements as if it’s the last thing he wants to be doing and he thinks no one is really listening? This happens because the person in question does not see his job as an opportunity for art. It would be much more demanding and stimulating for him to really invest himself into this mundane task and come up with an entertaining and unique way to read the announcements. If he can achieve this, his job becomes a platform for him to create art, something he can happily give away for people to enjoy. As an artist, he would likely find his job far more fulfilling and his employer would value him more highly, too. Pour emotional labor into your job and make it a platform for your art. How many of Picasso’s paintings can you name? Two? Three? He actually painted over 1000 works of art. That is the nature of artists; they produce. Artists don’t worry about having bad ideas that turn into failures, because they know that as long as they persistently produce art, good ideas will be made. The fact that some failures are produced is an inevitable cost of success. At the last moment before completing something, most people begin doubting themselves: Is this really ready? Is it good enough to show the world? This is when true artists – true linchpins – step up and ship anyway. Products must ship or they won’t be bought. Stories must be printed or they won’t be read. Even the best ideas are useless if they lack an audience. The TV show Saturday Night Live, for example, goes live on the air every Saturday whether the skits are fully rehearsed or not. This ability to ship on time is so rare that it makes linchpins indispensable: They have the discipline to make sure the projects they undertake get defined, done and delivered as promised. They strip away everything pseudo-productive and focus on things that help them ship. Shipping is difficult because the primal lizard brain in all of us does not want us to show our work to the world, as it might get criticized or laughed at. This phenomenon is called the resistance, and it creates procrastination and self-doubt. The best way to deal with resistance is to acknowledge it. Sure, you will fail often, and you will probably be criticized sooner or later, but you can choose to listen only to constructive criticism and ignore the harmful kind. Whatever you do, don’t stop producing and shipping. True artists get stuff done – they ship. For a long time, the economy has been based on equitable trades, preferably enforced by a contract: “You can listen to my music if you pay me twenty dollars.” Genuine gifts – as in giving someone something with no expectation of getting anything in return – were practically unheard of. In fact, if you tried to give a stranger a genuine gift, for example by offering a shared cab ride to someone going in the same direction as you, they would have probably refused, because they were nervous about how they should reciprocate the favor. But unreciprocated gifts are becoming a winning tactic, especially on the Internet. Consider the digital photographer Thomas Hawk. He shares all his pictures online for free. A cynic might say, “All that work and no reward,” but in fact, giving away his photos has made him famous: people talk about him, follow him and ultimately give him plenty of paid work. Gifts, given with good intentions and not as manipulation tactics, are talked about and the givers are rewarded. The linchpins who pour themselves into their work to give such gifts become well-known, celebrated and desired as employees. True artists give their art away without demanding or expecting reciprocation; it is simply in their nature to produce it. In fact, because their art is so unique, it would be impossible to compensate for it monetarily. How could anyone adequately compensate the waiter who devotes himself to great customer service, bringing in countless customers and brightening everyone’s day? Ironically, although artists may demand no compensation, true artists of this kind are so rare that people often pay whatever it takes to keep them. Otherwise, someone else will. To succeed today, you must give people genuine gifts. The key message in this book: Today, you can no longer succeed by being unremarkable and just following instructions. Instead, no matter how scary it seems, you must choose to be an outstanding, indispensable linchpin. Linchpins are like artists; they see their work as a platform for their art and pour emotional labor into it every day. Their art is a unique, immeasurably valuable gift that they give to others. The questions this book answered: Why is it essential you become a linchpin? Today, if your job involves just following instructions, you are replaceable. Linchpins are indispensable, so they get the best jobs. What stops most people from becoming linchpins? The lizard brain generates fear to stop you becoming a linchpin.

Well, their successes were the result of pursuing loonshots – ideas that seem downright crazy right up to the moment it becomes unthinkable that anyone ever did things differently. But here’s the thing: for every world-changing idea, there are dozens – if not hundreds or thousands – that don’t pan out. As Thomas Edison once put it, progress is measured in failures: each defeat rules out one possibility and brings you that much closer to the solution. On the one hand, that makes experimentation vital. On the other, it means that real progress is expensive, time-consuming and ultimately risky. Those three words fill every risk-averse, efficiency-maximizing organization with an eye for the bottom line with dread. That’s why they often end up missing out on the next big thing. So what’s the answer? Well, as you’ll learn from the examples in these blinks, there is a way to balance innovation and what the author, Safi Bahcall, calls franchising – keeping the already successful parts of an organization ticking over. The secret is to separate the two activities and provide a sheltered, protective space for creatives to work on their ideas. Think of it as a loonshot nursery. So read on to learn how the most successful organizations do that, and why the US military took a pass on an early radar prototype; how even proven innovators can end up in blind alleys; and what loonshots can tell us about the history of the West. Innovation takes time, money and work. The greatest ideas fail a thousand times before they succeed. But here’s the rub: organizations often get cold feet before path-breaking projects ever get off the ground. What could have been the next great thing ends up as little more than a pipe dream. In other words, they fail at nurturing loonshots – ideas that seem positively unhinged right up to the moment they turn the world on its head. So what’s the right way to foster innovation? Well, it’s sometimes argued that it comes down to culture – the informal rules governing organizational life. There’s a problem with that explanation though: it’s wrong. Take Nokia. The Finnish multinational enjoyed a three-decade hot streak between the 1970s and the early 2000s. Its innovations included the world’s first cellular network, car phone, all-network analog phone and the GSM phone, making it one of Europe’s most profitable businesses. Experts attributed the company’s success to its culture. Magazines like Businessweek ran features on Nokia’s egalitarian ethos while the CEO put it down to the fact that employees were encouraged to have fun and think outside the box. Fast forward to 2004. Internally, nothing had changed. In fact, the engineers behind all those hits had just had another eureka moment: an internet-ready touchscreen phone with a state-of-the-art camera and an online app store to go with it. Nokia’s leadership shot the project down. Three years down the line, Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone. The rest is history. What went wrong? Well, Nokia’s structure had changed. That’s often part and parcel of growth. When organizations start out, employees have a high stake in success: if a small biotech firm produces a wonder drug, for example, everyone involved won’t just be incredibly rich – they’ll be heroes! Failure, on the other hand, means they’ll be out of a job. Perks like fancy titles and promotions don’t mean very much in such a free-flowing, high-stakes environment. As organizations grow, that changes. Those bonuses become ever more attractive, and individuals’ stakes in projects decrease. That breeds a conservative mind-set, and companies become franchise operations dedicated to protecting the parts of their businesses which are already successful. The outcome? Innovation falls by the wayside as decision makers come to view loonshots like Nokia’s proto-iPhone as intolerably risky. But that isn’t a law of nature – organizations can put structures in place that encourage innovation. Let’s see how. The Allies’ victory over Nazi Germany was a century-defining moment. But if there’d been prediction markets in 1939, the odds would’ve favored Hitler. Why? Well, the Allies lagged behind in what Winston Churchill called the “secret war” – the race to develop more effective weapons. That wasn’t because they didn’t possess the necessary know-how. In fact, the Americans held the key to winning the great aerial and naval battles of the future decades before they entered World War Two – they just didn’t know it. Unlike their Axis counterparts, who were developing a new generation of submarines and planes, they weren’t nurturing breakthroughs. Take radar. In 1922, two American radio scientists named Hoyt Taylor and Leo Young made a remarkable discovery: when a ship passes between a radio transmitter and a receiver, the strength of the radio signal doubles. Keep an eye on the strength of the signal you’re receiving, and any radio receiver will tell you an enemy ship is on the move. This had the potential to revolutionize naval warfare, and Taylor and Young told the US Navy about their findings. The answer? Silence! Eight years later, Young was still experimenting with radio signals. During a field test, he noticed that transmitting radio signals upward into the sky had the same effect: when they hit passing planes, the signal that returned to earth was doubled. Incredibly, that worked on planes at an altitude of up to 8,000 feet. Young wrote to the US military and asked for a $5,000 grant to pursue research into his prototype for an early warning system for enemy aircraft. It was denied. According to military planners, a project that couldn’t be expected to yield results for at least two or three years wasn’t worth their time or money. They did eventually thaw and took a gamble on Young’s loonshot, but the delay proved fatal. On December 7, 1941, the warning system was still being field-tested when 353 Japanese bombers launched a surprise attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii. Dozens of battleships and hundreds of planes were destroyed. All in all, 2,403 servicemen lost their lives. It was a shocking lesson in the dangers of complacency and the cost of failing to pursue innovation. As we’ll see in the next blink, few people took it to heart more than Vannevar Bush, the man who would pioneer a new approach to military planning. So what were military planners doing that was so important they couldn’t free up resources to pursue research into radar? Well, they were running a classic franchise organization: producing ever-greater quantities of tried-and-true conventional weaponry. Generals were convinced that tomorrow’s wars could be won with yesterday’s tools – infantry, guns and bayonets. That was an attitude the engineer Vannevar Bush had seen firsthand while working with the US Navy after the First World War. Nothing, he believed, was more damaging to the nation’s long-term interests. His answer? A military research department run by non-military men like himself and given free rein to explore the seemingly bizarre. After a meeting with President Roosevelt in June 1940, Bush got what he wanted: a new, civilian-led unit called the Office for Scientific Research and Development or OSRD for short. Bush’s stroke of genius was to recognize that he couldn’t change the military’s conservative culture, but he could change its structure. Establishing the OSRD as a separate department was a way to nurture loonshots while letting the generals get on with what they knew best: marshaling the ranks and fighting the good fight. And it worked. By the end of 1940, the OSRD had commissioned 19 industrial labs and 32 academic institutions to carry out research on its behalf. Even better, it had recruited an eccentric investment banker called Alfred Lee Loomis who dabbled in technological research. Loomis had heard about Germany’s worryingly advanced weapons development programs from exiled European scientists – among them Albert Einstein – who’d visited his private laboratory. When he got the call from Bush, he dropped everything and assembled a crack team of engineers and physicists to help the Allies catch up. Their goal? To develop a portable radar system using microwave, a radio wavelength that produces radar images so precise that they can be used to detect objects as small as submarine periscopes. That was valuable in solving one of America’s greatest logistical headaches in the war with Germany: keeping supplies flowing across the Atlantic. Allied convoy ships were regularly picked off by German submarines, with 4.3 million tons of cargo lost to sub attacks in 1941 alone. By 1943, 514,000 tons were being lost each month. But that number dropped decisively after microwave radar was deployed – just 22,000 tons per month were lost between March and June of that year. As the German Admiral Karl Dönitz admitted, Germany had “lost the Battle of the Atlantic.” Vannevar Bush rescued a large organization whose focus on its franchise operations and neglect of innovation had landed it in an existential crisis. But nurturing loonshots isn’t solely about winning wars – it’s as vital to success in business as it is on the battlefield. Take it from Theodore Vail, a boardroom pioneer who did for a struggling telecommunications giant what Bush would later do for the US military. But before we get to that, let’s rewind a little. In 1907, the financier JP Morgan bought the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, or AT&T. A direct descendant of the world’s first telephone company, AT&T had an illustrious past, but its future was less certain. The original patent for the telephone had expired, and thousands of competitors had eaten into its margins. Morgan hired Vail to turn things around. Vail hit the ground running, making the bold promise that Americans would soon be able to call anyone anywhere in the country. But long-distance calls faced a seemingly insurmountable obstacle: electric signals faded as they traveled down a line, and no one understood why. The electron had recently been discovered and the science that held the answer – quantum mechanics – was still in its infancy. It looked like Vail was setting himself up for an epic fall. Undeterred, Vail established a new department to pursue “fundamental research” and hired the MIT physicist Frank Jewett to head it up. Eight years later, AT&T astounded the world with a public demonstration of a call from its New York headquarters to San Francisco. But that was just the beginning. Over the next half century, Vail’s brainchild presided over a stunning run of breakthroughs. The transistor, solar cells, the Unix operating system and the C programming language, were all developed within AT&T. Along the way, the company’s researchers picked up eight Nobel prizes and made their employer one the most profitable corporations in the United States! And here’s where our stories intersect. When the two men met during the First World War, Jewett made a lasting impression on Bush. Once Bush had set up the OSRD, Jewett was one of his first recruits, and his experience would prove indispensable to the war effort. In the next blink, we’ll learn how the ideas of Bush and Vail complemented each other and provide a blueprint for other organizations. Innovators are often viewed as lonely geniuses single-handedly translating their brilliant visions into reality. In truth, innovators need someone to champion their work. Like careful gardeners, these loonshot enablers tend their plots to ensure the best ideas take root and thrive. Doing that, as both Bush and Vail realized, is all about applying a couple of basic principles – call them the Bush-Vail Rules. Here’s the first rule: shelter the people responsible for high-risk, early-stage ideas – the artists – from the soldiers responsible for managing the already successful parts of an organization. Embryonic ideas usually come covered in warts, and soldiers – like the military planners who dismissed radar – often struggle to look beyond these. They want products and projects ready for instant roll-out, and that means they’re likely to bury loonshots that don’t fit the bill. The result? Well, ask the film studios that passed on an incomprehensible screenplay called The Adventures of Luke Starkiller – the prototype of Star Wars, one of the most successful movie franchises of all time! That said, artists and soldiers are equally important – that’s rule two. It’s a lesson Apple learned the hard way. During his first stint at the company, Steve Jobs nicknamed the people working on the Mac “pirates.” Those working on the less glamorous Apple II home computer, on the other hand, were dismissed as “regular Navy.” Tensions between the two camps ended up tanking both products and costing Jobs his position. When he returned to Apple 12 years later, Jobs reevaluated his approach and supported both artists like Jony Ive, the designer behind the iPhone, and soldiers like Tim Cook, the architect of Apple’s return to financial health. Which brings us to rule three: act as an intermediary between artists and soldiers rather than trying to micromanage loonshot projects. Both Bush and Vail kept out of the technical details of the projects their departments pursued. They saw their role as managing the weakest link in the chain that leads to breakthroughs: the transfer from creators to users. Take aircraft radar, one of the OSRD’s great contributions to the war effort. When it was first adopted, pilots ignored it. The reason? Radar boxes were too complicated and fiddly to use in the middle of an aerial dogfight. When Bush heard that feedback, he demanded a redesign. The result was a much simpler display which pilots actually used. So far we’ve explored the importance of balancing innovation and franchise operations and the rules that effective loonshot nurturers have adopted to do just that. In this blink, we’ll take a closer look at two different types of loonshots in action: game-changing products and strategies. Let’s start with product-driven innovation. Few companies in American business history relied as heavily on cutting-edge products as Pan Am airlines. Founded by JT Trippe in the 1920s, Pan Am started out as a taxi service flying wealthy New York couples to Long Island. It was a popular route, but there was a problem: the repurposed World-War-One-era planes Trippe was using only seated one passenger. His solution? Import state-of-the-art French engines, move the fuel tanks to the outside of the fuselage and add another seat. It was the kind of tech-driven hack he’d repeat again and again. By the 1960s, Pan Am had launched the Jet Age – the beginning of our era of cheap mass aviation – and became the largest airline in the world. All of that was down to the early adoption of the latest products, especially new types of aircraft engine. In 1965, Pan Am signed the largest corporate deal in history and launched its fleet of Boeing 747s. Pan Am prospered – until disaster struck. In 1987, the US government deregulated the airline industry. For 50 years, the price of everything from seats to cocktails had been overseen by the central authorities. Now, the market set the rates. Pan Am was suddenly surrounded by competitors who could offer cheaper tickets and pay their workers much less than Pan Am’s pre-deregulation contracts required it to. Pan Am had the best jets, but no one wanted to fly in them. It was the beginning of the end. In 1991, the company went bust. Other airlines prospered in the new business environment. Their secret? Well, take American Airlines. Rather than focusing on glamorous new products, it concentrated on strategic innovation. Shortly after deregulation, it introduced America’s first two-tier pay system. Employees hired before 1978 retained their old salaries while later hires entered the lower-pay “B scale.” Those savings allowed American Airlines to buy new planes, expand the company, create new jobs and keep skeptical unions onside. It was a canny move: by lowering average labor costs, American leveraged the benefits of being a large company and closed the gap on start-ups with smaller overheads but more limited reach. We’ve discussed a couple of reasons organizations miss loonshots, but there’s one culprit we haven’t gotten to yet: overweening leaders who champion their favored loonshots come hell or high water. Call it the Moses Trap – the reliance on holy leaders. Let’s take a look at one of the most innovative companies of the twentieth century to see how it works. Established in 1937 by Edwin Land, the consumer electronics giant Polaroid was responsible for a breathtaking series of advances in photography. Over 30 years, Polaroid pioneered sepia and black-and-white prints, automatic exposure, instant color printing, the SX-70 all-in-one foldable camera and sonar autofocus. But in 1977, Polaroid took a wrong turn when Land presented the Polavision camera. It was a technological masterpiece. Weighing less than most hardcover books, it could process beautifully rendered, high-detail three-minute film negatives in 90 seconds. The press hailed it as Land’s crowning achievement, and Polaroid began churning out hundreds of thousands of Polavisions. So why you haven’t heard of the Polavision? Well, consumers didn’t want it. To begin with, it was expensive: in 2018 dollars, the camera cost $2,500. The single-use film cassettes, meanwhile, came in at $30 a pop, making both regular videotapes and Super 8 film much cheaper. More importantly, digital cameras – the true product of the future – hit the market shortly after Polavision’s launch. So why did it take Polaroid until 1996 to produce its first digital camera, over a decade later than Sony, Canon and Nikon? Here’s the crazy thing: recently declassified US government documents show that Land knew all about the advantages of digital photography – in fact, he’d been instrumental in persuading President Nixon to adopt it for military purposes as early as 1971! Remember the Bush-Vail Rules? Land pretty much flouted them all. Soldiers just weren’t very important to him. And rather than creating a favorable climate for the best ideas to thrive and taking a back seat, he literally held the keys to the company’s research labs. Land’s decisions always took precedence over his team leaders’ calls. And what Land really loved was film, not cameras. When the Polavision project ended in failure, Land brought a visitor to the warehouse in which the cameras had ended up. Asked why he wanted to show anyone such a sad scene, Land replied that he wanted him to “see what hubris looks like.” So far we’ve looked at organizations’ internal structures. In this blink, we’ll zoom out and take a look at loonshot nurseries on a macroscale to see what we can learn about the context in which they operate. To get us started, let’s think back to that Luke Starkiller script. In a parallel timeline the Star Wars franchise wouldn’t have ever seen the light of day. So how did “Jedi,” “lightsaber” and “Sith” become household names? Here’s the short answer: Hollywood had more than one studio. Put differently: all the scriptwriters had to do to get Star Wars off the ground was keep asking until someone said yes. And that’s true of loonshots in general. As long as there’s another door to knock on, every crazy idea has a chance. That’s why the context outside an organization matters so much. The best example of that is the ultimate loonshot – the Scientific Revolution. That’s basically the idea that the world is governed by universal laws of nature which can be discovered through empirical observation and experiment. Today, that’s pretty much commonsensical, but for millennia, truth was determined by the say-so of rulers and religious authorities. That changed when we first figured out that the Earth and planets followed an elliptical orbit around the sun. That discovery is usually credited to a sixteenth-century Danish astronomer called Tycho Brahe and his assistant Johannes Kepler, the author of the 1609 book New Astronomy – the text that kickstarted the Scientific Revolution. But here’s the thing: a Chinese scholar called Shen Kuo had already reached the same conclusion almost half a century earlier! But as we know, China – once the world’s most advanced power – declined while the West went from strength to strength. Why? Well, context. Both Shen and Tycho fell out with their rulers when they asked for money to confirm their findings. Shen, however, lived in an empire with a single, all-powerful ruler; Tycho, by contrast, lived in a continent divided between hundreds of smaller, competing states. When Shen lost his backers, his ideas were quashed for good – the only studio in town had turned him down. Tycho meanwhile quickly found someone else willing to take a gamble on his loony ideas – King Rudolf II of Prague. That just goes to show how important it is to protect fragile ideas, create structures that nurture out-of-the-box thinking and leave artists to do their thing without excessive meddling. The key message in these blinks: Loonshots – ideas that seem too crazy ever to work but end up changing everything – make the difference between failure and success in both business and war. They can even determine the fates of nations. But risk-averse organizations often miss out on these great leaps forward because they’re so focused on immediate results that they overlook the importance of creating structures that encourage experimentation and innovation.

Unless you’re the Grinch, or prefer gloom to glee, joy is an emotion that lifts our spirits and fuels our inspiration. So imagine just how great it would be if you could be joyful in every aspect of your life; not just on weekends but at work, too. You might enjoy your daily commute, and find working hard feels instead like play time. Such a situation doesn’t have to exist only in your imagination. Based on the practices of the highly innovative and successful software company Menlo Innovations, these blinks will show you how to turn any workplace into a joyful center where employees thrive. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why a software company would support bringing babies to work; what the advantages are of high-speed voice technology; and how wearing a Viking helmet can help you promote openness. Unless you’re the grumpy Scrooge of Dickensian fame, joy is an emotion you crave and enjoy. Being happy and full of life is better than being miserable and gloomy, isn’t it? So why don’t we incorporate more positive feelings – such as joy – into our workplaces? Joy drives people to seek a higher purpose and leave a lasting impact on the world. And joy can be a valuable motivator in the business world, where it manifests as a desire to work on something larger than yourself and belong to a supportive community. You’ll find that joyful people work longer and harder than ever before to achieve such goals. Consider the difference between the Wright brothers and Samuel Pierpont Langley. While both Langley and the Wrights were striving to create the first-ever airplane, their motivations for doing so diverged. Langley wanted fame and fortune; the Wright brothers wanted to experience the joy of flight. And it was the pursuit of joy that inspired the Wright brothers not only to win but to soar! Another benefit of bringing joy to the business world is that joy serves as a base for your company’s culture, which helps unite and shape your team of employees. When the author invites clients to his software company, Menlo Innovations, he asks: If half of his employees express joy for their work and the other half doesn’t, which employees would the client prefer to work with? Of course, the answer is always, the joyful ones. As it turns out, Menlo’s clients implicitly understand that joyful employees are more productive and engaged in their work, which leads to better results. So we’ve learned that joy is a way to reach new, higher goals and that joyful employees create a joy-driven culture. But what does a joyful company actually look like? Keep reading to find out. Would working in a dank, windowless office make you feel joyful? Probably not. The design and layout of your office can have a huge effect on how your employees feel when they’re working. The author observed this firsthand when he redesigned his company offices, creating a large, open space where employees could see each other and work together. This open environment is chock-full of employees, talking and laughing. In fact, it feels more like a lively restaurant than an actual office! Menlo has made sure that its office space would be easy to redesign, too. Electrical wiring is adapted for this purpose and furniture is lightweight, making any move hassle-free. For the author, this flexibility distinguishes the company from typical corporate spaces, where work is fixed and routine. Allowing employees to play around and have fun creates a relaxed but creatively charged environment. Even more so, the ability to rearrange the space helps employees be more productive. At Menlo, employees have total freedom in this regard. Sometimes they move things around to ensure a team is seated together; other times, moving things around is just a way to create change for its own sake. When you change where you sit, you literally change your point of view. Think about it: after spending ages sitting at your desk, mulling a difficult problem, say you get up and go to the kitchen. And then, when you open the fridge, ta-da! The solution comes to you. And that’s exactly why, by allowing staff the freedom to move around, Menlo creates a more productive workplace. Open workplaces also have another benefit, in that they help facilitate communication; which, in turn, promotes joy. This is important, as being able to communicate more directly is a great way of avoiding misunderstandings and unnecessary conflicts in the workplace. Menlo uses a technique called high-speed voice technology (or in non-Menlo speak, “direct communication”). This system provides many benefits. For one, it supports active listening. Since employees can hear many conversations around them in an open workspace, anyone can jump into any discussion if they have something to add, or just want to ask a question. This approach does run against common practice, however. At most companies, arguments are often handled via proxy, such as through another person or by email. In conversations via proxy, it’s easy to become passive-aggressive or to misread the tone of a conversation, which can lead to conflict. Direct conversations help you avoid conflict. Being able to speak directly, and in person, promotes conviviality. Also, since you can see the other person’s body language, it’s easier to understand their true message. Additionally, having conversations allows employees to build relationships, which in turn leads to improved productivity. Employees at Menlo work together in pairs. Each pair is assigned a single computer, which makes clear communication a necessity. This pairing approach also has a learning component. Each member has something to teach their counterpart, and also something to learn. But it doesn’t end there! To ensure relationships are built across the entire team, every week the pairings are rearranged, giving employees the opportunity to form new relationships. Most families have rituals or traditions, such as Sunday dinner and holiday celebrations. We also like to keep artifacts, like photographs, that tell stories about our past. These rituals and artifacts constitute our family culture. The same holds true for business. If you want to promote joy in your company, you have to choose your artifacts and rituals carefully. That’s why Menlo’s leadership created rituals geared to promote an open, joyful culture. Instead of holding ordinary meetings, they have a daily standup at 10 a.m., during which each employee team tells the others what they’re working on. To make the atmosphere more joyful, they pass around a horned Viking helmet. When it’s time for a pair to present, they each grab one horn and hold the helmet between them while sharing. Later in the day, at 3 p.m., the entire staff takes a walk together, a ritual called walkies. This allows employees to stretch their legs and get some air while conversing and building relationships with team members. Additionally, the company relies on a show & tell ritual, which is basically a version of the classic game with a twist. A team that has completed a project watches as a client attempts to explain exactly what the team has done. This ritual keeps clients and Menlo employees on the same wavelength. One more important aspect of Menlo’s culture is the work authorization board. This workboard displays the tasks for which each pair is responsible. This visual artifact plays a major role in reducing conflict by removing ambiguity about who’s doing what. So just as you can get to know a person based on the photos he hangs on his walls, rituals and artifacts in the workplace can reveal and reproduce company values. A joyful company culture is made up of strong, almost familial bonds. This of course begs the question: how should you recruit new members to join your family? The most important thing is to ensure that your interview process aligns with your core values. In other words, it’s far more important to hire based on personal traits and openness to joy than on actual skills. When candidates apply to work at Menlo, they take a tour of the office as part of the interview process. If they appreciate the communal workplace, there’s a stronger chance of a match between employee and company. Of course, that might mean that the company has to pass over some solitude-loving geniuses, but that’s okay. Because for a joyful culture, the whole must be greater than the sum of its parts. Kindergarten skills, or the ability to play well with others, are another important factor of Menlo’s personality-driven interview process. To discover whether candidates have good kindergarten skills, Menlo invites all candidates to a mass interview (dubbed an extreme interview) filled with various interactions with Menlo staff and each other. This process tests the candidates’ ability to joyfully interact with others. This gets to another core component of the hiring process: Let your team take part. At Menlo’s extreme interviews, two candidates work together while one Menlo employee observes. In total, each candidate works in three different pairs with three different employee-observers. And then, at the end of the interview, employees collectively evaluate the candidates. First impressions count, so don’t forget that as you’re hiring! If you aspire to a joyful company culture, that spirit should be the first thing a candidate experiences when walking through the door. Could you experience joy in a pitch-black room if you’re afraid of the dark? Not really. And that’s exactly why creating a safe, comfortable working environment is critical if you want employees to try new things, voice their opinions and experiment freely. If the fear of failing is taken away, employees will take more risks, which will lead to greater innovation. Here’s where feeling safe (as opposed to being safe) becomes a necessity. When people are focused on being safe, they’re likely to be cautious; yet those who already feel safe will have more courage to experiment. At Menlo, employees feel safe because they know failures won’t be criticized. This allows them the freedom to take calculated risks. This practice has led to some interesting innovations, such as Menlo babies. The company decided to see what would happen if an employee who had just had a child brought her into work every day. Having a baby in the office turned out to be a perfect match for the company’s joyful culture. And as an unexpected result, Menlo’s “baby-friendly” culture became a unique selling point when pitching to potential clients. But although experimenting can sometimes lead to noteworthy innovation, it can of course also lead to failure. That’s why it’s important to allow ideas to fail faster, as opposed to letting a failing project drag on, wasting time and money. For instance, Menlo’s Ford Everest project aimed to combine 30 different platforms in a single Web-based system. Because of the project’s scale, no one wanted it to fail; so the company ploughed in more and more money ($400 million in total) to make it work. Yet the project was doomed from the start. In the end, Menlo had to even spend an additional $200 million just to shut the project down. If only the company had simply allowed the endeavor to fail faster, it would have saved considerable time and money. The key message in this book: In business, promoting a joyful company culture, one based on openness and transparency, drives innovation and productivity. In fact, aligning everything you do with joy will make employees happier, thus motivating them to work harder. Actionable advice: Open up your workspace, open up minds.  Tearing down physical walls effectively tears down the walls that can lock in new ideas. So get rid of gray cubicles or unnecessary offices, and let employees design their collective space as to encourage collaboration and open conversation.

They can interrupt work flow, disrupting your whole day, and sometimes they feel like a mere platform for the most extroverted, outspoken colleague to talk at you for an hour. Perhaps even worse, sometimes they feel like no more than a long-winded rehashing of information you’re already familiar with. It doesn’t have to be like this. Meetings are essential to a smooth-running company; unfortunately, many leaders don’t know how to use them effectively. These blinks will – hopefully! – remedy that. In these blinks, you’ll learn why everyone doesn’t need to attend every meeting; that having a timed agenda might be a secret weapon for meetings; and how technology is changing meeting rules. They say that time is money, so it wouldn’t be wise to waste the time of your employees, right? Yet this is exactly what’s happening everyday when companies drag their staff into inefficient meetings. How much money is being wasted? If you take the hourly rate of the people attending and multiply it by the length of the meeting, you’ll start to get a good idea. For executives, it would be in the thousands of dollars; for lower level employees, each person would cost around $50 in lost revenue. Overall, on a yearly basis, meetings cost an average company around $25,000. So what can be done to reduce this money drain? One of the simplest solutions is to make sure the meeting starts on time, which means getting people to arrive before the scheduled start time. Imagine if an Olympic runner decided to show up to the race just as the gun went off. They’d never catch up to those who were in position and ready to go. The same holds true for those who show up right when a meeting begins. These people are actually late, since they keep things from moving forward and make the meeting less effective. So make sure everyone knows that being on time actually means getting there five minutes early. You can tell employees that being timely is a sign of respect, and being tardy clearly signals disrespect, both of the company and of their coworkers. Another solution is to allow for opt-outs. People often get called to a meeting even though they have no real business being there. So why not share the agenda a few days in advance and allow people to opt out of attending if there’s no business relevant to them being discussed. You could also provide a timetable for attendance along with the agenda, which would allow people to schedule their arrival and departure in accordance with relevant portions of the meeting. This way, no one needs to waste an hour of their day to discuss five-minutes worth of business. While there certainly are bad meetings, it’s important not to overlook the positive effects meetings can have, such as boosting employee morale. If company meetings are only reserved for managers and executives, a company runs the risk of alienating lower-level employees. This is not a good idea. These employees are often the face of the organization; they usually deal with customers, and their work can be stressful, with minimal reward. So why not make sure they receive a regular boost to their energy level? The toughest times of the day are the mid-shift dips, at 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., when energy levels are often at their lowest. This makes them the perfect time to hold team meetings designed to raise morale and make sure employees know that their work is appreciated. You can also boost morale by having daily, high-energy huddles that bring together the entire company. These huddles needn’t take more than seven minutes or so – just enough time to share positive company news and any forecast data that shows how departments are working together to reach short-term goals. You can also take a moment to address any questions or concerns, and then finish with a group cheer. Ending with a cheer might sound corny, but it’s effective for building team camaraderie – after all, it works for sports teams, right? It can even be as simple as, “Let's go!” Or, “Time to shine!” Another effective tool can be three-minute adrenaline meetings. All-company huddles aren’t very practical if you have hundreds of employees. And if you’ve grown to a certain size, it would take far too long to try and explain to every employee all the different goals each department is trying to reach. So sometimes it makes more sense for a single team or department to get together for a few minutes every day. Again, the purpose is to boost everyone’s energy and morale and to keep everyone informed on the current progress being made and how their work is directly helping. It’s also a chance for people to air frustrations, learn from each other and, most importantly, get inspired. Most jobs run the risk of becoming repetitive, which can lead to employees becoming tired and uninspired. Meetings can be a good antidote to the workday doldrums – a refreshing break from the daily routine and a chance for staff to flex some different professional muscles. Any meeting brings with it the chance to assign a few roles, such as moderator, or chairperson, the person whose job it is to make sure everyone sticks to the agenda and doesn’t go off topic. Then there’s the time-keeper, who’s in charge of making sure the meeting is running on schedule. There’s also the closer, who keeps track of what transpired during the meeting and closes it out by telling everyone the commitments they’ve made and what deadlines they agreed to. But no meeting would be complete without the participants, those who arrive on time, prepared with productive input, ready to add and take value from the meeting. All these roles provide an opportunity for people to grow their skill sets. Different people can be assigned these roles so that a variety of people get the chance to try new things. For instance, someone in customer service might benefit from being a closer, a role that offers the opportunity to sharpen attentiveness and the ability to pick up on the main points of a discussion. New employees, or the youngest team members, might appreciate the opportunity to take on the moderator role. This will give them a chance to gain some experience in a role of responsibility, by fielding questions from participants and keeping the meeting on track. Every successful company strives to have well-functioning, self-reliant teams. But before this can happen the team members must learn the appropriate skills. And this is another benefit of meetings: they provide a useful opportunity to temporarily change the power dynamic in order to enhance skill sets. When you’re setting up a meeting, you don’t need to have the typical leaders run the show. Even though managers and executives are traditionally in charge of meetings, there’s no rule that says it must be so. In fact, such rigid traditionalism is often a waste of both time and money, since executives are generally a company’s highest paid employees. So why not let lower-level employees run meetings from time to time? There are a number of ways this can benefit a company, such as encouraging bossy employees to be team players. It’s common for a staff to have someone who’s bossy and tends to overstep boundaries, but these types can be assigned fact-finding or note-taking roles in meetings to bring them in line. This also encourages them to listen to others and wait their turn to speak, which is a big part of being the kind of productive team player that the best teams have. Conversely, you can also use meetings to bring quiet personalities out of their shell. Shy employees can be as valuable as anyone else, and they can provide great insight when they do speak. If an employee tends to be quiet, they may just take more time to think before they speak, or are waiting to be asked. This makes meetings a great place for quiet staff members to speak up for themselves, and you can encourage this by giving them the role of moderator. Not only will this get them into the habit of speaking up; the prestigious role can also provide a confidence boost. Otherwise, they could be made lead participant of their team and given the task of representing them at the meeting. This will also ensure that they play a role in the decision-making process that determines the direction of their team. If you had to name the number one purpose for meetings, what would you say? Yes, it might be tempting to say, “taking a nap” – but let’s set sarcasm aside. Meetings are all about communication. By bringing together leadership and team members, meetings are the best way to make sure everyone is on the same page in regards to their goals and how well they’re moving toward them. Reaching a goal requires strong cooperation across the board, and there’s no way of achieving this without an open flow of communication. One of the most effective and efficient ways for leadership teams to keep track of their goals is to use meetings for monitoring their quarterly progress. Quarterly finance meetings should involve the company CEO, the board of advisors and team leaders. Before the meeting, financial statements and any valid data should be prepared and ready for discussion so that everyone can discuss what is working and what isn’t. Quarterly business meetings should also be used to check in on progress, ensure accountability and see whether changes need to be made. These meetings are especially important in times of rapid growth. In these meetings, team leaders from every department – marketing, IT, engineering, finance – can take up to 30 minutes to describe their progress. This is a chance to get into the details of metrics and whether or not their quarterly target goals were met. They can then make new goals for the next quarter, make predictions and decide on a course of action. Weekly action review, or WAR, meetings can then be used to keep employees on track to meet those quarterly goals. Each week, lower-level employees can meet for 60 to 90 minutes to discuss metrics, flag any issues that are preventing goals from being met and brainstorm solutions to these problems. These meetings are a necessary part of fostering a responsible and transparent workplace. For this to happen, people need to be held accountable for their progress, or lack thereof, during these meetings. Finally, there should also be one-on-one meetings every week, between a team leader and a relevant member of their staff. This is important for creating a support network that ensures everyone is on the right track, that problems aren’t being sat on and that lower-level employees know that management values their efforts. Obviously, setting goals and staying on the right track is an important part of any successful business. But how does a company decide which track is right for them? A popular and effective way of developing the perfect company strategy is to send team leaders on a yearly retreat – a sort of corporate vision quest. The purpose of a retreat is to set the right environment for leadership to form strong bonds and engage in creative “blue sky” thinking. Through this process, a vivid vision for the company can then be formed. This is a fully formed image of what the company should be like three years from now. A true vivid vision is crystal clear down to the last detail. So imagine what people are talking about around the water cooler, what company ads will look like, where your revenue sources are coming from and what your customers look like. After picturing this three-year vision, the clock can then be turned back to reveal the two-year vision of the company – then the one-year vision, and finally the six-month. With these in place, the right path, with all the short-term goals along the way, should reveal itself. But remember, this isn’t just your vision; everyone on the retreat must agree. Otherwise, there’s little chance that the vision will come true. The retreat is not a paid vacation. It’s one of the most important meetings you can have, giving you the opportunity to bond and align your goals with the other leaders of your company. Annual retreats can serve other purposes as well, such as developing the company’s core values and new approaches to customer relations. You might suggest that people take turns sharing different techniques and management styles that they’ve picked up from books and seminars over the past year. Just keep in mind, a retreat is a time to get away from traditional whiteboard brainstorming sessions and find new ways of thinking by taking advantage of a relaxed environment. There’s no avoiding the fact that things change, and that goes for meetings as well. Due to the outsourcing of certain jobs and an increase in remote working, virtual or online meetings are becoming a popular way for coworkers to stay connected. And as long as you’re aware of the possibilities and limitations of this technology, there’s no reason a virtual meeting can’t be a step up from the traditional meeting. For a virtual meeting to be effective, one of the first things to realize is that you may need to speak differently than usual, especially if your meeting is audio only. For example, if people can’t see you, it’s important to pause between sentences every once in awhile, so that people can chime in with a response. It’s also wise to provide vocal gestures to let others know that you are engaged in the discussion. A simple “mm-hm” will reassure the speaker that their message is getting across. One of the benefits of online meetings are the various ways to share documents and give presentations. Gone are the days when email was the only way to share notes, attachments and suggestions for changes. Google offers an array of ways for team members to simultaneously work on and share spreadsheets, documents and presentation slide shows. You can also keep track of all the changes being made and leave virtual sticky notes for people. Even daily huddles can be performed remotely, so there’s really no excuse not to stay in touch with your team. The author knows at least one CEO who uses his phone to make sure a day doesn’t go by without an energizing team huddle. So even if you’re away from the office, you can use the power of technology, along with the power of a good meeting, to keep your team connected and motivated. The key message in this book: It’s true what they say: time is money, especially in the corporate world. So to make sure you’re not wasting people’s time and throwing money away, meetings need to be both effective and efficient. Holding regularly scheduled meetings is still the best way to communicate and get everyone on the same page. But that’s not all – meetings can also improve employee skill sets, strengthen teams and help build the very foundation of your company’s values and goals. Actionable advice: If an employee says they don’t want to attend a meeting, respect that. You should foster a culture where employees take the initiative to read the agenda and decide for themselves whether or not to attend a meeting. Far from being lazy, a well-organized employee may realize that they cannot contribute anything. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Once you’ve been through these blinks, you’ll also be able to call on dozens of examples of specifically modern kinds of meltdown, their causes and how to prevent the same happening to you or your organization. We’re living in an age of unprecedented technical capability: transport, commerce, medicine, power… you name it, the systems around us are more advanced and yet also more complex than ever before. That’s why authors Chris Clearfield and András Tilcsik wrote Meltdown, to unpack the ways complexity leads to failure. And they’re making the antidotes available to us all. In these blinks, we’ll cover the core components that lead to modern system failure and how to tackle them. Then we’ll break down the tools needed to failure-proof systems and organizations – like structured decision-making, diversity, dissent, reflection, iteration and a list of warning signs. In these blinks, you’ll learn how the Fukushima nuclear disaster could have been avoided; why diversity makes organizations stronger; and how parents can learn from ER teams and harness the power of iteration. What do BP’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the global financial crisis all have in common? Yes, they’re all crises, but they also share the same underlying causes. Modern systems are more capable than ever, yet increased capability has also driven up complexity and made systems less forgiving. Take the finance industry, for instance: the switch from face-to-face to computerized stock-market trading has helped reduce operational costs, increased trading speed and given more control over transactions. But the digital shift has also made the system harder to understand and increased the chance of complex, unexpected interactions. Finance has become a perfect example of what sociology professor Charles Perrow would call a complex, tightly coupled system.  Perrow was an expert on organizations hired in the late 1970s to investigate the causes of a nuclear accident in Pennsylvania. What he discovered revolutionized the science of catastrophic failure.  Perrow identified a combination of small failures behind the disaster that interacted in a domino effect. Instead of blaming the nuclear plant’s operators or calling it a freak occurrence, Perrow saw that the accident had been caused by features inherent in the plant as a system – complexity and tight coupling.  Tight coupling is an engineering term for when a system is unforgiving or has little buffer between its parts. The system for cooking a Thanksgiving dinner, for instance, is tightly coupled: the meal involves many elements that depend on each other, like stuffing that cooks inside the turkey and gravy that comes from the roasted bird’s juices. And with only one oven in most houses, one dish could set back all the rest. Complexity in a system means that it’s non-linear and hard to see inside. If we stick with the Thanksgiving dinner analogy, cooking a turkey is a complex system, because it’s hard to see inside the bird to tell if it’s cooked. Complexity in a system makes it tough to identify problems and their knock-on effects. A combination of complexity and tight coupling takes us into what Perrow calls the Danger Zone. This is where meltdown – the collapse or breakdown of a system – becomes highly likely. So that tightly coupled, complex Thanksgiving dinner could well be doomed unless precautions are taken. Perrow’s complexity/coupling formula reveals the shared DNA behind all kinds of modern meltdowns, so failure in one industry can now provide lessons in other fields. We’ll find out how in the following blinks.  When you go for a drive you put on a seatbelt even though you don’t know the exact nature of any accident that could happen. You simply know the danger is there and that the seatbelt could potentially save your life. In the same way, Perrow’s complexity/coupling formula helps prevent failure without showing the exact form it could take. This means that you can plan ahead to reduce complexity, for instance by increasing the transparency of a system. Failure to do so can even lead to fatal accidents. Take 27-year-old Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin, who, in 2016, died getting out of his Jeep Grand Cherokee when the vehicle rolled and pinned him against a brick pillar.  The reason behind this tragic event was the design of the car’s gearshift. It was elegant but it didn’t clearly show whether the car was in “park,” “drive,” or “reverse.” In other words, the system was unnecessarily opaque and complex, which led to Yelchin wrongly assuming the vehicle would remain still. Tragedy could have been avoided had the gearshift been designed more transparently and indicated clearly in which mode the Jeep was.  Transparency reduces complexity, making it hard to do the wrong thing – and easier to realize if you’ve made a mistake. Sometimes, though, transparency isn’t possible. If you think of an expedition to climb Mount Everest, there are dozens of hidden risks from crevasses and falling rocks to avalanches and sudden weather changes. The mountain is always going to be an opaque system. So mountaineering companies troubleshoot small problems, like delayed flights, supply problems and digestive ailments before they can accumulate into major crises. This stops such problems from hindering the final climb, where there’s little margin for error. When the complexity won’t shift, there’s always the buffer. Nuclear engineer turned management consultant, Gary Miller, describes how he saved a bakery chain from failed expansion by increasing their buffer. Before rollout, he spotted that their new menu was overly complex and relied on an intricate network of suppliers. When they refused to address this, Miller persuaded them to relax their aggressive launch schedule instead, which allowed them enough slack to deal with problems when they inevitably surfaced.  Perrow’s complexity/coupling formula helps figure out if a project or business is vulnerable to failure and where. It identifies vulnerabilities in a system, even if it can’t tell you exactly what will go wrong. As Miller says: “You don’t need to predict it to prevent it.” We often go through life making snap judgments or using our instincts. There’s no harm in that until we find ourselves operating in a complex system. Engineers of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan used their instincts when they falsely estimated the height of their tsunami defense wall. On March 11, 2011, an earthquake caused a wave several meters higher than they had planned for, which flooded the generators responsible for cooling and triggered the world’s worst nuclear accident in 25 years. But how could the engineers have done any better? Defenses of this kind are vast and expensive to build, and as they couldn’t build an infinitely tall wall, the engineers had to anticipate a height that they were very sure would work. To do this, they used a confidence interval, a calculation based on comparing the highest probable wave height and the lowest. The trouble is that humans are not very good at making these kinds of forecasts: the ranges we draw are too narrow.  One solution is to use a structured decision-making tool called SPIES, or Subjective Probability Interval Estimates. It pushes us to consider a broader range of outcomes. Instead of just assessing the best and worst plausible scenarios, SPIES estimates the probability of several outcomes within the entire range of possibilities. It’s not perfect, but studies consistently show that this method hits the correct answer more frequently than other forecasting methods. Had the Fukushima engineers used SPIES, they could have safeguarded against overconfidence and been less likely to overlook the seemingly implausible scenario that flooded their defenses.  Another structured decision-making tool is the use of predetermined criteria, which helps us focus on the factors that really matter. Take the Ottawa Ankle Rules, for example: this set of predetermined criteria was developed in Canada in the early 1990s and to reduce doctors’ use of unnecessary X-rays of feet and ankles by a third. By focusing only on pain, age, weight-bearing and bone tenderness to decide whether an X-ray was necessary, they avoided getting side-tracked by irrelevant things, like swelling. In complex systems like medicine and tsunami prediction, the effects of our decisions are hard to understand or learn from, and intuition often fails us. That’s when tools like SPIES and predetermined criteria can provide an interruption to business as usual, allowing us to approach our choices systematically. We often choose to ignore warning signs – if your toilet blocks, for instance, would you simply consider it a minor inconvenience, or see it as a warning sign of an impending flood?  Ignoring warning signs can sometimes have catastrophic consequences. In Washington DC in 2005, three metro trains came within a few feet of crashing deep under the Potomac River. Only luck and quick action by the train drivers saved the day. Engineers suspected that the underlying cause was a problem with the track sensors, but before they got around to fixing it, the problem went away. So they invented a testing procedure, hoping to ensure the same glitch couldn’t happen again elsewhere. The trouble was, their bosses soon forgot about this near-miss and stopped running the tests. Four years later, the same error showed up in a different spot, causing a horrific crash and the deaths of nine people. We often ignore the clues in small errors, as long as things turn out OK. That near-disaster in 2005 was a warning sign that the metro organization chose to ignore. An essential feature of complex systems is that we can’t find all the problems just by thinking about them. Luckily, before things fall apart, most systems give off warnings. Unlike the DC metro, the commercial airline industry is a prime example of how paying attention to small errors can pay off. By doing so, they have collectively reduced fatal accidents from 40 in every one million departures to two in every ten million over the past 60 years in a process called anomalizing.  Here’s how it works: First, data needs to be gathered on all flights. Next, the issues need to be raised and fixed – incident reports shouldn’t gather dust in a suggestion box. The third step is to understand and address the root causes instead of seeing mistakes as a series of isolated incidents. If pilots on a particular route keep flying dangerously low, then there could be an underlying signal or signage problem, for instance. The final step is to share learnings, which sends a clear message that mistakes are normal and helps colleagues anticipate issues that they might one day face.  In systems like air and metro travel, we can learn from specific operational incidents. Business owners, on the other hand, can learn from a dedicated team or a trusted adviser hired to identify threats from competitors, technological disruptions and regulatory changes. Speaking up isn’t easy. In fact, neuroscience shows us that a desire to conform is hard-wired into our brains. But that doesn’t make dissent any less valuable. Here’s why: In a strange-but-true study of airline crew errors, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that between 1978 and 1990 nearly three-quarters of major accidents happened when it was the captain’s turn to fly. That is, not the less-experienced first officer. That was alarming because the captains were flying 50 percent of the time, so their errors should have been equal to or less than their deputies’.  So the NTSB dug deeper. They confirmed that the captains weren’t worse at their jobs – far from it – but that their seniority meant their mistakes were going unchallenged. Their first officers lacked the tools with which to give the captain feedback and were bottling up concerns or giving vague hints instead of raising alarms. Hierarchy was putting lives in danger. So the airlines introduced a groundbreaking training program called Crew Resource Management (CRM). The pilots thought it so basic that they jokingly called it charm school, but it broke the taboo around raising concerns. CRM radically reduced the number of accidents and leveled responsibility to 50:50 between pilots and their deputies. By democratizing safety, the program empowered everyone from cabin crew to baggage handlers to voice concerns, also harnessing the motivational power of shared responsibility.  So how do you encourage dissent in other types of organizations? One effective way is through open, as opposed to directive leadership. Directive leaders will state their own preferred solutions at the start of a conversation and tell colleagues that the goal is to all come to an agreement.  An open leader will hold back their own opinion until last and encourage colleagues to discuss as many perspectives as possible. Amazingly, this simple technique is proven to yield more possible solutions and almost twice as many facts, which makes for a better-informed discussion. Simple! If hierarchies, social concerns and even our brains’ wiring work against dissent, then it’s paramount for leaders to nurture more than just an open-door policy. As dissent expert Jim Detert explains, you need to actively encourage people to speak up, or else you’ll be discouraging them. Most people agree that diversity is a fair and positive thing, right? But did you know that it’s also been shown to reduce risk for organizations? In a landmark 2014 study, scientists proved the benefits of ethnic diversity when it comes to decision-making. In a simplified stock-market simulation, they observed dozens of diverse and homogenous groups as far afield as Singapore and Texas and assessed the accuracy of their trading. And guess what? The diverse groups performed markedly better than homogenous ones, pricing stocks more accurately and making fewer mistakes. Fascinatingly, the study found that crashes were more severe and price bubbles more frequent in homogenous markets because homogenous groups put too much faith in each others’ decisions, which caused errors to multiply. In diverse markets, participants were more critical of each others’ decisions and copied less often, which led to more rational decision-making.  In hindsight, we can apply the lessons of this study to understand the financial crash of 2007 and 2008. Former Citigroup CFO Sallie Krawcheck stated in a 2014 interview that those responsible for the crash weren’t “a bunch of evil geniuses” able to foresee the financial downturn, but that they were “peas in a pod.” Krawcheck blamed the lack of diversity for the poor decisions leading up to the crash and argued that diversity makes it more permissible to ask questions without looking stupid or worrying you’ll lose your job. So why don’t all companies have compulsory diversity schemes? They must be effective, right? Wrong. In a 2016 Harvard Business Review paper, sociologists Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev found that the most frequently used diversity programs failed to get results. Not only that, but over the past three decades and in more than 800 US firms, compulsory diversity schemes actually made organizations less diverse. They found that managers had rebelled against compulsory schemes because they felt they were being policed. They had resisted hiring diversely just to assert their autonomy. Luckily there are other solutions that work. Over the same three decades, voluntary as opposed to compulsory mentoring schemes were proven successful in helping diverse candidates progress. These schemes naturally reduced bias with positive messaging: managers felt like they were being exposed to new talent pools rather than having their hiring decisions policed. The study also found that formal mentoring schemes were more effective than informal ones because white male executives didn’t feel comfortable approaching young women and minority men informally. Allocating them mentees removed this awkwardness and allowed them to mentor a diverse range of junior employees.  With benefits like increasing accuracy and avoiding the next financial crash, diversity is the safe alternative to homogeneity and groupthink. The healthy skepticism that comes with diversity makes organizations and decisions stronger. We’ve all been there – with the end of a project in sight there’s a strong urge to rush to the finish, even if the conditions have changed.  Pilots call it get-there-itis, but the technical term is plan continuation bias, and it’s an alarmingly common factor in airline accidents. If you’re only 15 minutes away from your destination, and the weather changes, it’s much harder to divert to a nearby airport than when you’ve just started out. Perhaps you’ve experienced the same effect when working toward a deadline?  Pilot Brian Schiff knew the dangers of get-there-itis when he refused to take a furious Steve Jobs on his charter flight. In spite of pressure and entreaties, Schiff remembered his training and calculated that hot weather, heavy luggage and hilly terrain would make take-off in their small plane risky. Schiff still remembers how intimidated he felt as a puny 20-year-old in the firing line of Jobs’ wrath. But he didn’t budge and refused to fly. Schiff stood up to a very important customer, but instead of being reprimanded, he was rewarded for pausing and prioritizing safety in a high-pressure situation, and saw his pay doubled.  But sometimes there’s no time for reflection when situations change: in an emergency room, for instance, medics have to balance caregiving tasks like resuscitation and administering medication with monitoring the patient’s overall condition. This is where an iterative process becomes indispensable. Effective iteration includes three basic steps: tasks, monitoring, then diagnosis – or offering a solution.  The three steps are then repeated in a cycle to evaluate and improve solutions on the go.  A great domestic example of this is a parenting strategy from the authors of a paper called “Agile Practices for Families: Iterating with Children and Parents.” To improve the chaos of their family’s morning routine, the Starrs decided to hold regular family meetings to discuss what had gone well that week, what they could improve and what they would commit to improving in the week to follow. After committing to changes, they would repeat the questions at the next meeting, allowing them to focus on the most effective solutions over time. Their experiment was so successful that when New York Times columnist Bruce Feiler visited their home, he described theirs as “one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.”  You can use iteration to check in whenever you have a backlog of tasks and deadlines. The key is to go through the steps and then re-evaluate once you’ve tried a solution. The key message in these blinks: We live in the golden age of meltdowns, but it’s within our reach to bring that era to an end. The solutions listed in these blinks are hard to implement because they often go against our natural instincts or accepted organizational and cultural norms. But if we give due consideration to complexity and tight coupling, we can unlock greater innovation and productivity in modern systems while avoiding catastrophic failure. Actionable advice: Give yourself a pre-mortem. You might have heard of a post-mortem, but did you know that its inverse – a pre-mortem – can help to prevent failure?  When planning a project, try imagining failure as a foregone conclusion. Research shows that you’ll then think of far more potential glitches than if you’d imagined what success would look like. This technique harnesses what psychologists call prospective hindsight, and it’s also useful for finding more concrete and precise reasons for an outcome.  So next time you’re at the planning stage, instead of asking, “how can we make this work?” try “what could have caused this to fail massively?” Got feedback?

What to read next: Originals, by Adam Grant In these blinks, you’ve learned why even the most well-crafted systems sometimes fail. But you’ve also learned some of the things we can do to make sure we catch the cracks in the system before disaster strikes. One important takeaway is that every team needs to have its share of non-conformists, people who can think outside the box and who aren’t afraid of criticizing the status quo. But non-conformity and the ability to think differently aren’t just important in avoiding the meltdown of systems. In Originals, author Adam Grant argues that non-conformity and creativity are indispensable for anyone who wants to succeed in life. But how do you encourage creativity and non-conformity in yourself? Grant has some good advice. So if you want to give your creativity a boost, head over to our blinks to Originals.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

A world that’s moving so fast that you can’t keep up with everything and everyone. How many times a day do you think, “I need to calm down,” and before you know it, you’re googling for cheap tickets to the Bahamas? But wait! There’s a cheaper way to go about it. You don’t have to run away or jump on a plane every time you feel completely burned out. In fact, you don’t even have to leave your workplace to refresh your focus and sustain your otherwise great ability to solve problems. Here’s the key: Mindfulness. Many companies have already opened up to the idea of mindfulness, and how it might benefit their work culture and thus business in general. And this is exactly what these blinks will teach you. They feature great insights into mindfulness, the way it works and who (aside from yourself and your business) is benefitting from it. In these blinks, you’ll discover that the benefits of mindfulness are supported by scientific proof; how the big US food company General Mills relates to mindfulness; and why multitasking is a very bad idea. For many people, work hours have become blurred and things like checking business emails outside of office hours have become commonplace. With this change, stress has become a considerable risk, not only to employees, but to companies at large. Shockingly, according to the World Health Organization, stress costs American businesses as much as $300 billion a year.  To deal with this challenge, more and more companies are catching on to mindfulness. You can think of mindfulness as the easiest form of meditation. Basically, it means paying attention to the present moment and noticing your thoughts without judgment.  So how does mindfulness relate to work? Simply put, it makes dealing with issues at work easier. Mindfulness has many benefits, which we will delve into in the blinks that follow. But what all of these benefits have in common is that they make us more self-aware, train our focus and increase clarity. All of which are valuable qualities to have in the workplace. Mindfulness allows you to step back from the problem and observe it so you can deal with it more objectively and reach solutions more easily. For example, working with a colleague who slacks off can make you livid, but being mindful can help you realize the reasons for their behavior. Perhaps they are tired because they have a newborn baby, and talking to them about it can solve the problem. As a new generation of companies start to understand the benefits of mindfulness, a mindful work culture is already gaining momentum. Even multinational companies have cottoned on. General Mills, for example, was a pioneer in providing mindfulness training during work time. The training was initiated by Janice Marturano, who began practicing mindfulness after dealing with personal and professional stress. Soon, hundreds of General Mills employees were participating, and now all of the firm’s buildings have meditation rooms. Up until the 1990s, it was difficult for fans of mindfulness to get others on board with the idea. The effects they were experiencing with the technique weren’t quantifiable and there was no scientific study to support the practice.  However, since the invention of functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI – a technology that can measure brain activity through blood flow – the benefits of mindfulness can now be scientifically proven. By using fMRI, scientists can demonstrate that when we meditate, the area of our brain responsible for thinking about ourselves becomes significantly calmer. Experiments have also shown that when someone carries out a task that makes them think about their own thoughts or behavior, such as highlighting a word that describes themselves in a text, and then follow up with a mindfulness exercise, the brain’s reactions to similar situations that involve self-reflection are gradually reduced. This means that with time, those who practice mindfulness can decrease the degree to which they are judgmental, because their brain has practiced being more objective. Another benefit to mindfulness is that it shapes our brains. They aren’t rigid structures – a brain can in fact change a great deal. It can be trained like a muscle and altered by repeated thought processes. This quality is known as neuroplasticity. Research has shown that mindfulness increases activity in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, heightening our kindness and compassion. It also strengthens our cortical thickness – or gray matter – which aids memory function and emotion regulation. Perhaps the most noteworthy finding, however, relates to the amygdala. In stressful situations, such as a job interview, our fight-or-flight response is triggered by the amygdala. This is obviously an overreaction, as the days of having to run from, or face and kill an animal predator are largely gone. When we practice mindfulness, the amygdala gradually relaxes in the long run, which helps us keep stress at bay. As more studies and more high-profile people like Steve Jobs began endorsing mindfulness, people started paying attention. But it wasn’t until one man in particular started tailoring mindfulness practices to Western culture that it really gained popularity. During the late 1970s, Jon Kabat-Zinn developed a method called Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). MBSR is independent of any religious belief and is based on training the attention, with the goal of becoming fully present and focusing on the physical sensations in the body. For example, one exercise involves noticing if you’re experiencing pain anywhere or if parts of your body feel relaxed. After a few repetitions, you’ll begin to realize that pain and relaxation aren’t constant, but continually change in intensity. In this way, MBSR trains your self-awareness and emphasizes the impermanence of things. Applied to stress, this means observing your thoughts and physical reactions and watching as they dissipate. By observing your reactions objectively, you’ll come to learn that no pain or stress lasts forever. With Kabat-Zinn’s MBSR, mindfulness and meditation entered mainstream culture, offering an effective solution to the ubiquitous problem of stress. As we’ve seen, mindfulness is about observing your thoughts and emotions and deciding what to concentrate on.  Focusing on one thing at a time is far more efficient than multitasking, and mindfulness is great at helping you do just that. At work in particular, we’re bombarded with stimuli such as multiple computer screens, which cause perpetual distractions. So how do we react? By multitasking.  However, contrary to popular belief, this isn’t a productivity booster. Instead it means we’re frantically jumping from one task to another. Furthermore, multitasking adds more opportunities for your mind to wander as you consider what to do next. It’s far more effective to figure out in which order things should be carried out and then tackle one thing at a time. Say, for instance, you start thinking about what you should do next at work. Thoughts like “I need to pick up some groceries” or “I have to confirm my reservation at the restaurant” will start sneaking in, because they’re also on your to do list. Thankfully, as mindfulness develops your focus, your ability to direct your attention slowly becomes automatic, and knowing how to prevent your mind from chasing every thought you have means you’ll be less easily distracted. But how do you train your attention? Well, be it at your desk, a basketball game or talking with a colleague, you must observe your thoughts so that you can bring yourself back into focus. For example, when National University professor Mason Fries was a college wrestler, he was about to win a match against a former national champion. But when he got his opponent onto the mat, thoughts like “I can’t win, he was a champ” crept in and he lost his grip. If he had focused on the moment, it would have helped him, and he could have won the match. Have you ever noticed that people who practice mindfulness not only seem to be calmer, but also kinder and more open? This is because mindfulness nurtures a sense of self-compassion and connectedness to others. As you learn to observe your emotions in a non-judgmental way, you’ll start to see that feelings like frustration are natural and that we all have a bad day now and then.  Once you get to this level of compassion, you feel a sense of relief as you learn to accept negative emotions and open up to joy and empathy. As it develops, it begins to radiate outward to people around you, enabling you to relate to their problems and emotions in a more empathic, non-judgmental way. This can be referred to as a sense of common humanity or social connectedness. This sense of connectedness to others can be strengthened using a special meditation called metta, or loving kindness. Metta involves wishing yourself happiness, protection and freedom from harm. As you train these feelings toward yourself, you can start to wish them upon people directly around you, other people you know, and finally everyone in the world.  Some people view compassion as something soft or weak, but it actually makes you stronger. It means being more aware of the feelings of others and wanting to prevent them from experiencing pain. For example, police officer Cheri Maples always used to become stressed and aggressive when she was called out on the job. But practicing mindfulness changed her perspective and she started to see the call as an opportunity to help rather than a lure into a fraught situation. Of course, mindfulness isn’t a magic wand that makes all our problems disappear, but it does make us more aware of our own and others’ feelings. Because of this, it helps make us more tolerant, loving and kind.  Because it involves you and everyone around you, mindfulness can be applied directly to your work, fostering compassion for others and the world beyond. Businesses with a mindful culture are likely to act responsibly when it comes to the environment, too. When you practice mindfulness for long enough, you’ll start to realize that you’re not only responsible for yourself, but in part for society as well. For example, outdoor clothing brand Patagonia tries to inform their customers about mindful consumption as they want to lessen negative impacts on the environment. They even began one of their campaigns by asking their customers not to buy their clothes, as a prompt to get them to reconsider their shopping habits. But mindful companies care about more than the environment: they care about everyone involved in the company. Take Eileen Fisher, an apparel brand that gives at least ten percent of its annual after-tax profits to its staff. In 2012, the company tackled the Chinese firms that made the silk they used in their clothes, because the production system was known for its harmful effect on the environment and poor conditions for workers. Now, 45 percent fewer chemicals and 25 percent less water is used for the production of Eileen Fisher’s silk in China. In addition, the silk workers receive better salaries and more time off.  Companies that support a mindful culture realize that they can initiate broader social change, too. Adherence to mindful principles can also influence employees and customers to support the social change they promote. For instance, ShareTheMeal, an app dedicated to collecting donations for hungry children worldwide, is very conscious of its goals. This not only encourages employees to believe in them, but also inspires them to spread the word about the app.  It’s important for companies to act socially responsibly, but this is only possible when the right people lead the way, as you’ll see next. What makes a good leader? Strength? Empathy? Strategic focus? Sadly, most leaders don’t embody these qualities, seldom listen to their employees and fail to communicate their targets. This is not the case for mindful leaders, however. Mindful leaders respond to challenges more easily, because they’re more focused on their goals. They’re aware of their own emotions and aims, acknowledge what is happening around them, and listen attentively. Because of this, they are far better positioned to make decisions based on honesty and compassion. Furthermore, mindful leaders break challenges down into manageable parts and, as a result, they manage their time more effectively, producing beneficial outcomes for everybody involved. Leaders who don’t practice mindfulness tend to become stressed out when faced with an urgent task and pass this stress on to their employees. A mindful leader will try to separate the task from stress and assign it to an employee who is skilled at handling that particular matter. As well as delegating efficiently, mindful leaders act as role models, foster compassion, and have the courage to change company principles when necessary. This is exactly how they inspire their employees to take more responsibility. Eventually, this positive approach causes a ripple effect and motivates employees to initiate other innovations and social change. It’s similar to the way a charity functions: once touched by the power of giving, donors are more likely to start sharing with others. For example, letting your employees choose which organization a donation will go to may well inspire them to organize their own fundraising or charity event. As with any trend, there will always be people who jump on the bandwagon, eager to make a profit, and there will always be skeptics.  Of course, some skepticism on the use and effects of mindfulness is warranted. Indeed, some critics have grounds to think that the spiritual or compassionate motives behind mindfulness practices are being capitalized on and exploited. Although not all the criticism is justified, the fundamentals of the practice – developing compassion – are becoming increasingly watered down. For example, some classes teach mindfulness just as a therapeutic technique or to boost workplace productivity, sadly skipping over compassion. This diluted form of the practice has become known as McMindfulness – a quick and shallow use of mindfulness as a tool. Moreover, as mindfulness increases awareness of emotions, it can lead to emotional struggle, as the emotions that have long been suppressed start surfacing. It’s not just about becoming happy, as some believe; it’s about dealing with all emotions. Due to the plethora of mindfulness organizations, teachers and classes now on offer, there is a growing need for a regulatory organization. As you may know, searching for a mindfulness class can be confusing, as there are so many out there. Therefore some general standards would be useful for establishing training courses, certificates, and so on. This would also prevent fraud, as participants would know how to find and read up on certified practitioners. Furthermore, those still deterred by inexperienced or disorganized Western practitioners may be more inclined to try true mindfulness. As we’ve seen, mindfulness can have a whole host of positive effects. However, it’s still a technique that requires practice and the right teachers. The key message in this book: Mindfulness can be practiced by anyone. Even in small amounts, it has a positive impact on your emotional and physical well-being, which is why more and more companies are choosing to implement mindful practices such as meditation classes into their culture. Actionable advice: Strengthen your focus. The next time you are stressed and feel your mind jumping around, try this: sit calmly with your eyes closed and focus on your breath. Notice how you inhale and exhale and how your breath flows through your body. As your mind starts to wander, gently coax it back to your breath. Even doing this for a mere five minutes can help calm and re-focus your mind. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Crafting a job ad, sifting through the hundreds of applications, interviewing and onboarding promising people – all of this can take weeks, or even months. And what if you hire the wrong person? Or what if your new employee decides that his new job isn’t for him? Well, then you have to start the whole process over again. These blinks help ensure that this never happens. They show you how to set up your hiring and onboarding process to get the most suitable candidate every time. By following these simple rules, recruiting will become a cakewalk. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you shouldn’t look for a “talented person”; Why just interviewing someone isn’t enough; and why every employee has a psychological contract with their employer. Hiring can be a costly process that many people would prefer to avoid. And yet, so many companies do it badly. In some industries, the turnover rate is around 20 percent. Having to constantly hire a fifth of your workforce will cost an awful lot of time and money. These companies are in a state of misplaced talent: they hire the wrong people for the wrong reasons. So let’s dive into how we can hire the right people for the right reasons, which starts by creating a framework that properly identifies what is required for the roles you are looking to fill. This might sound obvious, but you’d be surprised at how often important criteria such as experience, skills and education are left unspecified. Let’s say you have a vacant customer assistance position. Without specific criteria, you could find yourself hiring the candidate with the most colorful résumé, or the one with the Ivy League education, neither of which are actually relevant. To avoid this mistake, identify the job’s main criteria – things such as relevant experience in customer service. This way you’ll know just what to look for and avoid having to fill this position again after things go poorly. Now, a good list of criteria will include more than just the technical aspects of the job. Companies like Microsoft and Apple have found that an ideal candidate should also fit the cultural framework of the company. To identify these criteria, figure out what kind of values your company stands for and what your primary goals are. Are you focused on technological innovation, or maybe you want to provide an exceptional customer experience for travelers? Whatever it is, try to ensure that your framework is precise, focused and realistic. All too often companies create vague descriptions by saying they're looking for a “talented” or “skilled” person. But this isn’t useful unless you have something to judge that talent against. So it’s best to precisely define the skills you’re after and use specific language, and to mention the exact kind of degree you want your candidate to have. Once you know what to look for, the next step is finding the right candidates. Contrary to what you may have heard, modern technology hasn’t made this process a whole lot easier for the employer. All technology has done is make it far easier for people to apply for a job. This means you might get a thousand applications for your job posting, each vying for your attention. Of course, just receiving a barrage of applications doesn’t mean the candidates will be any good. Quantity doesn’t automatically mean quality. So start things off right by attracting the best possible candidates. The companies that always find themselves at the top of the “great places to work” lists attract high-quality candidates – and manage to hold onto them as well. Google, for example, often gets praised for providing a great work-life balance; they provide good benefits and also offer personal-development opportunities. Because of this, the company always has good candidates lining up, hoping to work for a great company. This shows us that employer branding is a great way to attract quality employees. And you can brand your company based on your employer value proposition, which is what your business offers in exchange for employment. This includes everything applicants should expect if hired, including the kind of recognition, compensation and professional development they’ll receive, as well as the quality of the management they’ll work under. The importance of these aspects will differ from person to person. So, to find out what potential candidates might value the most, check in with you current employees and ask them what they like the most about their work. After doing this, you should have a better sense of what your company brand is. Once you know that, it’s time to make it visible and advertise how much you value your employees. The most obvious ways to do this are to update your website and enlarge your social-media presence. All right, at this point, you should have great candidates applying for your job posting, all of whom you’ve considered, keeping an eye out for those who meet your well-defined criteria. The next step is to find out more about them and really narrow down which applicants might be perfect for the role. There is no precise rule about how to do this, but there are a couple of great ways to put the skills of your top prospects to the test. Interviews are, of course, a tried-and-true way to assess people. But to get the best and most relevant information, you should make sure your interview has a meaningful structure. The simple way to do this is to have a list of prepared questions that test the applicants’ knowledge of the job and the field you’re in, as well as their experience. You can even test these questions out on current employees to make sure you’re using suitably probing questions that provide the most valuable information about how suitable a candidate is for the job. But sometimes an interview isn’t enough to really narrow things down, which is when a good simulation can go a long way in helping you find the right fit. A simulation allows you to test the skill set of a candidate and determine whether they have what’s right for the job. So, if you’re hiring a writer, give him a deadline to submit some work so you can see how he performs under pressure. And you don’t have to rely on just one simulation to get all the information you need. One test might tell you how well he writes, but it might not give you any idea of how well he works with others. You should design different tests that give you a full picture of your top candidates. Assessments might not be perfect, but they can be a great help when trying to determine an applicant’s chances of success. So you’ve found your perfect candidate. Congratulations! Now it’s time to help that person reach his or her full potential. When someone performs well, it’s due to a mixture of capability and motivation to apply that capability. Most companies tend to forget about this second part – but you don’t have to be counted among the forgetful. There are a number of ways to provide motivation: offering rewards like a bonus or good compensation, or by praising and recognizing a task well done. More often than not, managers rely on money and forget about how effective good praise can be. They assume money does the talking for them and says everything that needs to be said, but this isn’t true. Let’s go back to the writer example and ask: What would make him motivated to keep producing great content? Many employees will tell you that receiving some appreciation works better than just getting paid. A pay raise is another tactic, but on its own it can also backfire. A better motivational technique is to offer a pay raise along with the chance to write more pages of content. This way, the writer gets more responsibility to match the pay, and you get more content to go along with it. It’s important that you find out what method of motivation will work for each of your employees. And a good way to go about this is to send out questionnaires to gauge their personalities and find out what motivates them. This way, if an employee says she loves hearing positive customer feedback about her work, you can then make sure these comments always find their way back to her. But questionnaires also aren’t a perfect method. A badly designed questionnaire can sometimes suggest that employees are expected to feel a certain way, and this can lead to their confirming that assumption rather than providing a genuine answer that reveals their true feelings. Trust is important for any relationship, including that of an employee and an employer. For an employee to provide their best work and for a company to achieve its goals, both parties need to know that they’re on the same page. To ensure this connection, a psychological contract is required.  This is an unspoken agreement between the two parties based on a set of mutual expectations. For example, the employee usually expects a regular paycheck and managerial feedback, while the employer will expect great work and punctuality. When both parties agree to fulfill their side of the bargain, everyone can stay happy and motivated to do their job. One way to make sure the psychological contract stays unbroken is to provide great development programs for your managers and staff. There are three things that you should keep in mind when initiating such programs: The first is self-awareness, which means that both the employees and managers are aware of their strong points as well as their weaknesses. To encourage self-awareness, you should create an environment where people feel free to make mistakes as a way of learning how they can grow and become even better. Second, don’t be afraid to challenge your employees. Challenges allow employees to develop and improve their skills, especially the ones that will help them continue to grow professionally.   Finally, you need to make sure you have the organizational support to meet the challenges and facilitate the development. This is generally done by having coaches and mentors available.   These development programs are extremely useful, but be careful that you don’t make them seem like a test. For example, you should never add an extrinsic reward, like a bonus, for the improvement. This will remove the self-development aspect of the processes. Remember, there isn’t one perfect way to hire a great employee and keep him or her motivated, but as long as you’re following these simple guidelines, you’ll certainly be on the right path. The key message in this book: Hiring doesn’t have to be a painful process. With the right perspective, it can be a very successful and rewarding operation, but only if its well planned and organized. For this to happen, you need to know what to look for, so be clear about what makes the ideal candidate a good fit for your environment. If you take all this into account, you’ll end up with more capable, loyal and highly motivated employees.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s a stale relationship or unsatisfying job, it can be difficult to put an end to what we don’t like. It turns out that human beings are remarkably flexible when it comes to putting up with things that suck joy out of their lives. Sometimes it’s important that we relieve ourselves of unwanted baggage so we can live fuller lives. Whether that means closing down a struggling business and going back to school or ending an abusive relationship, we need to take the plunge because the grass is almost always greener on the other side. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to make endings a normal, habitual part of your life; what signs you should look out for that indicate something should come to an end; and why it’s sometimes necessary to get someone else to end things for you. At some time or other, we’ve all hit that wall. We’re facing the end, and there’s nothing to be done. It’s a universal experience, and it can be galling. But it’s important to remember that endings serve a purpose. They mean we will eventually thrive in professional and personal settings. They are, in fact, necessary. For instance, there are times when it’s best to draw a line under a business venture or a product line. Perhaps a new technology has rendered those efforts unprofitable. Even design classics like the Walkman cassette player had to be put to bed eventually. It’s true of fashion trends too. Flared corduroy trousers might have been all the rage in the 1970s, but the current low demand means that there’s no point producing quite so many pairs anymore. Sometimes, even employees have to be let go. Why keep someone around if they aren’t living up to their promise? That's the time to find a better replacement who will help you achieve your long-standing objectives. What’s true in business is also true in our personal lives. Endings are inevitable, but they mean we can move on. An unsupportive relationship or friendship prevents us from blooming, and a dysfunctional or violent relationship or an unhealthy friendship is worse still. But your relationship with yourself is harder to see. Just think about your behavioral patterns or harmful habits. Maybe you’re too reliant on your parents’ support, for instance. Simply put: endings are good things. They are necessary. Without them, we’d all be unhappily married to our high school sweethearts, stuck in our first jobs, or burdened with unreliable employees. We'd never reach our goals or actualize our dreams. The gardener pruning his rosebushes has a clear goal in mind: healthy buds and vibrant colors. The question is, how's your metaphorical rosebush going to look? Ask yourself why and to what end you're pruning. In short, what are your goals? You might prune so that you have the energy to march out happy and contented each day. You might need, for example, to pare down a professional or personal relationship that’s getting a little invasive. In business, too, a little pruning is required, even when you have annual growth targets. Consider Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric. Welch pruned to push his business into the top two in the market. That meant cutting unproductive business initiatives, conducting annual layoffs, and paring away red tape. Under Welch, GE’s market value skyrocketed from a “mere” $14 billion to an astounding $410 billion. That’s some way to meet a target. In order to make the most out of endings, you have to normalize them. It’s common to think of endings as negative occurrences. That’s why we tend to avoid them. But as soon as we see endings as normal, there’s no reason to be afraid and run away from them. Imagine a small businessman. Let’s call him Blair. He used to be in the chemical manufacturing industry, but as technology advanced, his line of work became obsolete. He fought hard. He invested more money and searched ceaselessly for new potential customers. But it was no use. He was faced with the inevitable reality. Of course, it’s possible to fight and persevere. But that isn’t always for the best. Blair understood that so he folded his business. He went back to school and found a second successful career in investment. But how do we work out what’s worth fighting for? We’ll explore that next. As endings can be painful, we do everything within our power to avoid them. But how do we know when an ending is required? For starters, past action is a good indication of future behavior. So look to the past if you want to predict possible futures. What does this mean in practice? Let’s consider how the author counseled a friend who approached him for advice. The friend had a daughter whose boyfriend had proposed, and he was unsure if he should give his blessing to the couple. The author suggested his friend ask to see the boyfriend’s tax returns and a credit report. It’s not a question of money and means, but one of commitment and responsibility. If the boyfriend can't be trusted with credit or tax forms, how could he be entrusted with the friend’s daughter and with making a lasting commitment? Whether it’s a partner, business, or an employee, when it comes to straightforward futures, the past will hold the answer. The second indicator of success in a given scenario or situation is the trustworthiness of the person responsible. Examine the characteristics of the person you’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter if it’s a collaborator, business partner, son-in-law, or your own partner. Look closely. Can you trust him or her with the task in hand? Imagine you run a comedy club. Success depends on getting the punters to laugh and tell their friends, so you sell more tickets. One night you hire an amateur, but he dies on stage. He promises next time will be different. So, should you employ him again or get a proven professional next time? The pro will always be safer and more trustworthy if you want to keep your reputation intact. In short, if you want to know what the future will hold, analyze those on whom success depends. Endings seem hard because they require change. Because most of us only make changes when they're absolutely necessary, endings are particularly tricky. We need to be pushed by fear and pulled by the possibility that the new scenario will be even better. We’re best driven by a sense of urgency – whether it’s a need to escape a disappointing situation or to reach a better place. Imagine you’re running a chair-selling business. It’s not going so well, but you manage to keep things afloat. Now, what would you do if an employee told you a rival was selling trendier and cheaper products? Most likely you’d terminate your contract with your supplier and find a new one who can deliver you resources cheaper. Your employee created urgency and motivated you to change. If you’re using the power of urgency properly, then you've got to be realistic about your present situation. Can you imagine being in the same situation in the future? Most people need to smell smoke before they flee a burning building. That’s because it’s only then that they’re confronted with reality. Try this exercise. Stand in front of a mirror and be honest with yourself. What does your current situation feel like? Sense it: feel it, smell it, and imagine it playing out. Now, think about the future. Take those present sensations with you. Could you imagine still being surrounded by those same emotions and sensations in three or four years’ time? Of course not. Use that sense of dissatisfaction to create the urgency needed to make an ending. Would you, to use our example, still want to be scrimping by, selling the same old chairs, or really pushing your business forward and running with new market trends? Imagine you’re in a loving and close relationship with a man. But his noncommittal behavior means it’s difficult to picture a future with him. Nonetheless, you love him and can’t envisage bringing the relationship to an end. So what do you do? The first thing is to be clear with him. Clarify what your standards are, and then let him self-select. This means you communicate to the person your wants and desires and then allow him or her to consider if they can be met. If they can’t, then that’s that. You have your ending. You should declare your aspirations. For instance, you might want a partner who can be a solid husband, a father to your children, responsible, financially competent and passionate rather than lazy. Don’t be afraid to tell him. Finally, you can ask him if he is prepared to be that person for the long-term security of the relationship. However, not all decisions work like this. If it’s a matter that concerns you alone, then you will have to do your own self-selection. Say you recently moved to New York but couldn’t find work, or say you wanted to boost your failing one-person company. In both these circumstances, you’re the one who has to make the decision. At this point, you should be clear to yourself about your standards and expectations. This will mean you can self-select. Perhaps you could set expectation deadlines for yourself such as “If I don’t have a decent job by October, I'll move back home,” or “If my finances are still in the red in six months, I'll dissolve my company.” So, you’ve made the decision to end things. But how do you execute that decision? If you've ever had to end a romantic or professional relationship, you’ll know the conversation involved can be terrifying. Many people stall. It’s understandable. Let’s consider the hypothetical example of Lori and Jeff. For years, Jeff was Lori’s right-hand man in the advertising company where she worked as an executive. Jeff was sharp and performed amazingly. But he lacked social skills. Sometimes Lori found herself “cleaning up” after the mess he’d made. One day, Lori was offered a position at another firm where she could assemble her own team. After careful consideration, Lori decided against bringing Jeff. She just couldn’t face the drama anymore. She didn’t need to waste her time or energy on it. Nonetheless, despite having made her mind up, Lori procrastinated. Not because of the decision but because of the conversation involved. There’s a clear solution. You have to prepare yourself for these conversations by visualizing the end goals beyond the specifics of the conversation. To be able to follow through, you have to have a clear mind and clear objectives. If you don’t, you could get derailed by the other person trying to persuade you, or by the love you have for them. A good way to achieve clarity is to decide in advance what you want to say. Know what you want before you begin. Imagine you want to end an abusive relationship. You’d want to tell your former partner never to contact you again and that the authorities will be involved if he does. Only when you’ve fixed your goals can you begin the conversation. When you have clear objectives, you’ll be much better prepared for the uncomfortable conversation which ends it all. The key message in this book: It’s sometimes necessary for endings to arrive sooner rather than later. Relationships with employees, partners, friends, or business managers shouldn’t be sustained if they keep you from thriving. You have to take action, draw a line under the past and learn to move on. Actionable advice: Assess an ending and be clear about your intentions. Moods are contagious. Being affected by others can help you follow through with tricky endings. If you’re having difficulty escaping an unhealthy relationship, you should surround yourself by an ending alliance – a group of people who, like you, see the urgency for the ending. Being around these people will create a pressure that influences you positively to make the necessary ending happen. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maybe you were once a hugely imaginative child, always busy drawing, playing, inventing stories or crafting crazy objects, but now that you’ve finally earned yourself a “creative” job, the artistic ideas just aren’t flowing. The good news is that your creativity isn’t dead, you just need to free it. Unfortunately, however, it’s being held hostage by a giant hairball of corporate regulations, guidelines and practices trying to make you normal – too normal to be creative. These blinks tell you all you need to know about that hairball, including how to escape it without leaving your company altogether. You’ll also find out about a bunch of hypnotized chickens; what’s so great about being foolish; and how a creative company is a bit like a dancefloor. Are you an artist? Well, if you don’t make paintings or write poetry, you might be inclined to say no. But don’t be so quick to dismiss this possibility. In truth, every one of us is born a creative genius. Undisciplined children make rash decisions, diving spontaneously into risky situations and saying and doing whatever they like. They are driven purely by curiosity and innocent desire. These childhood tendencies are an expression of creative genius at the core being of every person. Everyone is born with this blissful “foolishness” that leads us to discover and evolve. However, lots of people fear that a society of “fools,” that is, one made up of people who follow their creative genius, can never function. So, they stifle their creativity in an attempt to be “normal.” This makes perfect sense from a societal perspective. After all, “fools” are seen as impulsive, unpredictable rule-breakers, and the enforcement of strict social norms is about protecting society from this unpredictability. Unfortunately, such protection also suppresses creative genius. For example, on many occasions, the author asked children from different grades if they considered themselves to be artists. When he asked first graders, they would all enthusiastically raise their hands, but when he got to the second graders, about half would identify themselves as artists. By the time he reached the sixth graders, only one or two kids would raise their hands. So, we can see that society suppresses creativity. But we can do something about it.       To break open the full potential of our creative genius, or if you prefer, our foolishness, we have to stop aiming for normalcy and stand up to the rules that enforce it. Can you remember the last time you bought a greeting card? Well, chances are it was made by Hallmark. After all, the company is a household name around the world. And like the majority of corporations, Hallmark is also a huge hairball of corporate normalcy.  In 1910, when Joyce Clyde Hall set out to start his “social expression company,” there wasn’t a single comparable business around. Hall had to write his own rules. He developed the first policies and procedures for doing business. These became the first two hairs of the corporate hairball. Then, in the following years, thousands of other policies and procedures were produced, all of them tangling together and forming a massive knot. This knotted hairball is the symbol of corporate normalcy – all the procedures, policies and guidelines that define what will conventionally make a company work more effectively, quickly and cheaply. Naturally, people are pulled into these hairballs of corporate normalcy as well. After all, we know from physics that gravity exerts a tremendous pull toward the earth that prevents us from careening out into space. We also know that the force of gravity becomes greater as the mass in question grows larger and larger. In a similar way, as the hairball becomes larger, and as more layers of guidelines, standards and procedures are added, so too does the pull toward it become increasingly powerful. Say you work for a new advertising company. The firm starts off by introducing a standard corporate design, which means every ad you make should have the same basic layout and color palette. Then they add a creativity guideline requiring you to attend brainstorming meetings and, finally, a new accountability guideline instructs you to write a daily progress report. With each additional rule, you’re pulled deeper and deeper into corporate normalcy. But is all that necessarily bad? Isn’t there some comfort in being part of a giant corporate hairball? Maybe, but it can also be problematic, which is what we’ll explore next. Have you ever been given a so-called “creative” assignment that required you to use a particular material, format and color scheme? If so, you know this is exactly what “creating” is not. Rather, creating is the act of producing something truly original, totally unobstructed by procedures and guidelines. And to engage in such creative work, it’s essential to avoid being snagged by the hairball, which is solely made up of how things used to be. For instance, early on in his time at Hallmark, the author was a sketch artist tasked with “creating.” But he found himself abiding too strictly to the company’s style. How did this happen? Well, the hairball is made up of old rules and practices; in other words, things that once worked. And since the hairball is so full of these old ways, there’s no space for novelty or originality. If you want to truly create, you have to first avoid being pulled too deep into that tangle of procedures. You need to orbit around the hairball, engaging with responsible creativity, which is a handy way to go beyond corporate normalcy. Responsible creativity entails straying from the standard corporate path, but not by too much. After all, if you disregard the company’s mission and aimlessly drift off into space, you won’t be part of the company at all. So, it’s crucial to remain within the orbit of the hairball by treating your company with loyalty and respect. But it’s also important to keep a critical distance and avoid being sucked in by its uncreative procedures and bureaucracy. For example, the author was initially hired by Hallmark’s editorial department. But the people in his department lacked any eccentricity, and just plodded along with the usual corporate decorum. So the author transferred to the Contemporary Design Department, Hallmark’s crazy stepchild. This department was doing tremendously successful and original work, and it was all thanks to the team’s freedom, chaos and playfulness. The author knew that the best way he could be creative for the company was to work in a department that granted him a bit more freedom. In other words, finding your personal sweet spot is the key. In the next blink, we’ll explore more in-depth ways to find your orbit and stay with it. Unless you’re starting to lose your marbles, you probably know that you’re not a chicken. Even so, you might be just as mesmerized as a chicken and in line for a similar fate. How so? Well, in 1904, the author’s father spent the summer in Ontario, Canada with his aunt and uncle on their farm. One playful Sunday morning, he and his cousin drew lines on the porch with a piece of chalk and then headed for the chicken coop. There, they pulled out dozens of chickens, one by one, put them on the chalk lines and held them in place for a moment. As a result, the chickens stood perfectly still, hypnotized in place. And, whether you believe it or not, you’re prone to such hypnosis as well. When you’re brought on board by a new company, they tell you all about their history, philosophy, procedures and politics. They then explain that adherence to these principles forms the essence of the company, and that it’s the ticket to their, and your, success. Here’s where you need to look out because, in essence, the company is drawing a chalk line for you to stand on. They’ll hold you to it, and, if you’re not careful, you’ll be hypnotized and immobilized before you know it. But there’s a way to avoid this hypnosis: hold on to your creativity and move away from the corporate line by following your own unique mind. After all, regardless of what opinions you hold, you’re unique insofar as you are the only you. There’s nobody else who has exactly your experiences, skills and passions. And to stay creative when working within a corporate culture, it’s essential to hold on to what makes you unique. Find the company goals that resonate with you and contribute to them in your own distinctive way. Nobody likes hanging out in small, enclosed spaces. So why do corporations hold on to job descriptions that serve as nothing more than restrictive cages? Granted, the container was an amazing invention. For instance, our ancestors needed water to survive, but it was risky to venture out of their caves for a drink. So, they looked for something to hold their water inside the caves and the container was born. But when it comes to companies, containers only serve to confine people in unnecessarily narrow job descriptions. Some job descriptions dictate exactly what the employee should and shouldn’t do, as well as what they’re supposed to deliver and how. In general, all job descriptions limit employees to a certain position from which they’re not allowed to deviate; in other words, they’re restrictive. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Instead, corporations can let their employees free on the dance floor, so to speak. Many organizations fear that, without job descriptions, employees won’t know what to do; they’re worried that conflict, chaos and confusion will ensue. But this assumption is totally false. After all, on a dance floor, dancers move freely without colliding and, similarly, employees who are free of restrictions do their work and cooperate. They’re capable of adapting their behaviors to those around them and to the changing demands of their company. So, getting rid of job descriptions is good for employees, but it’s also good for companies. Removing job descriptions will make a company more adaptable, since it can assign tasks to whoever is capable of handling them. For example, a graphic designer from the product design department who’s particularly well suited to web design could seamlessly join a group tasked with building the company’s new website. The key message in this book: Beware the dark, dull space of corporate normalcy, the place where any original thought will be smothered through procedure, guidelines and policies. Instead, let your natural-born creativity blossom by balancing the missions and goals of your company with your own originality.  Got feedback?

If you’re an entrepreneur or starting your own business, you’ve probably asked yourself that question at some point. Surely, there are many (many!) ways to go about it. But it is important to know: What needs and values – beyond the basic ones for the survival of your business – must you address to make your customers happy? And to make your employees and investors happy enough that they want to work hard for the business? The author sets out to answer that exact question. Based on Abraham Maslow’s celebrated Hierarchy of Needs and the author’s own experience with running a successful hotel business, these blinks will guide you through the steps necessary to make your business thrive by emphasizing relationships. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the author believes that relationships are the most important currency in both life and business; why meeting your customers’ unrecognized needs will make them advocates for your business; and why you should consider all your investors philanthropists. Have you ever found yourself downhearted and unable to see the light at the end of the tunnel? Sometimes all it takes to pull yourself out of a time of crisis is a good book. This is exactly what happened to the author, successful hotelier Chip Conley. Like many businesses, the author’s chain of twenty boutique hotels in the San Francisco Bay Area suffered badly during the recession in 2001.  The impact of the bursting dot-com bubble hit this region especially hard due to the many internet startups based in the area. Many businesses lost customers and money, Conley’s hotels among them. One day, struggling to cope with the grim state of his business, Conley left the office to take a walk around town. He soon found himself in a bookstore, browsing the psychology section and recognizing a book he vaguely recalled from his days in college. That book was Toward a Psychology of Being by Abraham Maslow, a classic in human psychology. The book focuses on self-actualization and finding peak experiences, or those high points of bliss in everyday life and work. The author immersed himself in the book, reading for several hours, soon realizing what he had to do: reconnect with the dream that inspired him to start his business in the first place.  He would return to the initial idea of creating a business where his customers, employees, investors, and even he himself, would find joy and fulfillment.  What do you hope to get out of life? Some people will gravitate toward money and material things. Others toward less tangible things like loving relationships, creative and pleasurable work, or making the world a better place. Abraham Maslow is a psychologist who proposes that there is more to life than simply survival and wealth. To illustrate this, he created a Hierarchy of Needs Pyramid. The pyramid puts basic human needs, such as food, water and shelter, at its foundation. Once these are met, new needs like social connection and appreciation emerge until we reach the top of the pyramid. Here, Maslow places the need for self-actualization, i.e., reaching our full potential and finding deep meaning in our life and work. Companies have a long history of ignoring higher needs like social connection, as it is intangible, i.e., it can’t be physically measured like financial profits. But recently a shift has been taking place and society is becoming more aware of the importance of intangible needs.   Take the South Asian country of Bhutan, where the king has decided to measure the prosperity of his country by looking at its Gross National Happiness index rather than the Gross Domestic Product. This same shift is beginning to happen in the business world as well, where we can see companies looking beyond the basic needs of customers and employees. For example, the intangible value of customer loyalty is now being sought after by companies as a way to measure new business through word-of-mouth recommendations.   And the needs of employees have also become important, as can be seen at outdoor apparel company Patagonia, which is shifting away from strict employee schedules and timetables for everyday work. As long as they make sure their work gets done, employees are free to enjoy breaks and outdoor activities on their own schedule. Have you ever wondered why some business managers seem less cheerful and happy than the people who work underneath them? One theory suggests that they might be lacking the benefit of a positive relationship with their customers. When you look at long-term statistics, you see that good relationships lead to a successful business. Economist Fred Reichheld explains in his book, The Loyalty Effect, that with a sustained increase in customer loyalty of just 5 percent, company profits can increase by as much as 25 to 95 percent. This goes to show that it is worth the extra effort to focus on customer satisfaction over generating short-term profits by cutting costs or compromising on quality. Strong customer loyalty can even be better than money in the bank when it comes to helping a business through tough times. For instance, following the 2001 economic crisis, the author was able to take advantage of the customer loyalty his hotels had built up over the years. His business sent out letters to their most frequent guests asking for support and to recommend their services to friends and family. The same long-terms benefits of good relationships apply to investors as well. Businessman John Bogle explains the importance of creating good relationships with investors in his book The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism. It shows that, when investors’ only motivation is to make profits, they usually only hold on to their stock in a company for about a year. But if an investor is motivated by a personal relationship and shared values, the average holding time increases to six years. So if you want customers and investors to stand behind your business through good times and bad, make sure you develop strong personal relationships. How many people do you know who say they love to go to work? Chances are, not many. After all, workplaces tend to be sterile, noisy and unpleasant.  But some companies are starting to realize that it doesn’t have to be this way. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to work at a place you didn’t want to leave? Companies like Google and Pixar are finding success by creating a new and exciting workplace with good food, fun events and nice parties. And this works out well because, at the end of the day, a big paycheck isn’t as great a motivator as you might think. Sadly, most companies still look to pay raises as the most effective way to motivate and hold onto employees. But studies have shown that focusing on money isn’t the best way to go. Underpaid employees will remain unmotivated and employees that are already well paid don’t become any happier when they receive more. What employees do want is to feel appreciated. This is reflected in the book Managing with Carrots – Using Recognition to Attract and Retain the Best People by Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton. It quotes a study revealing that, when companies put an employee recognition and appreciation strategy in place, they are twice as successful in generating revenue than those without such a strategy. Another way of motivating employees is to help them see and experience the good that comes from their hard work. The author makes this clear to his employees by inviting them to stay at one of his hotels, free of charge, four times a year. This gesture itself is a terrific perk. But, more importantly, it gives the employees a first-hand experience of the service they are providing their customers. So how do you go about creating customer loyalty? Ask yourself: Why do I keep going back to my favorite store?  It often comes down to good customer service. We tend to return to places where we feel welcome and supported in finding what we need. Therefore, it stands to reason that, if you can figure out how to satisfy your customers’ expectations, they’ll be more likely to remain loyal. The author’s Joie de Vivre hotel chain improved its chances at customer satisfaction by creating an online matchmaking tool. Customers answer a few questions and the service matches them to the hotel that best suits their personality and needs. This shows that when you can find out the specific desires of your customers, you’ll be better able to satisfy them. And there’s been a growing trend in customers wishing to be seen as individuals with unique tastes that need to be met.  Take the successful optometry store, Paris Miki. The customer provides a word, like “retro” or “quirky,” and a computer system uses the specific shape of the customer’s face to recommend the best frames and lenses. To go the extra mile in customer satisfaction, you can consider fulfilling the deeper desires of a client, even if it doesn’t necessarily fall into your business model. By tapping into your customer’s subconscious desires, you can provide an even more memorable and enriching experience. At the San Francisco restaurant Café Gratitude, the waiter, after presenting customers with the daily specials, performs the odd ritual of asking them thought-provoking questions such as, “Which important person in your life would you like to acknowledge today?” Or “What are you grateful for today?” By showing a willingness to share more profound and human ideals with its customers, the restaurant also satisfies their desire for a unique experience. An investment partnership can be like dating. For the relationship to be more than just a one-night stand you should make sure to find out what your investor is looking for. And finding out what they want should start at the business level. Don’t assume every investor is a philanthropist. Nearly every investor wants to make a profit. And while some will have good intentions and a willingness to invest in a good cause, others will simply be in it for the money. It’s important to figure out their expectations so you can act accordingly.  The author, for example, sends out an annual survey to investors in an effort to make sure he knows what they’re thinking and where their priorities are. Again, developing a strong personal relationship with investors is crucial for establishing trust.  During the 2001 financial crisis, the author turned to his investors for help. And due to their relationship, he was able to reach out to them using humor despite the grim situation.  Along with the annual financial report, the author sent out T-shirts to them that read, “I bought a hotel in San Francisco and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!” Furthermore, history shows us that investors will have your back and be more loyal if they believe in what your company stands for. This attitude dates back centuries to when members of religious orders would refuse to invest in slave trading or companies that dealt in alcohol or tobacco. Some investors really care where they put their money, and we still see it today with mainstream banks supporting investment opportunities in humanitarian and eco-friendly endeavors. The key message in this book: As in life, the beauty of business is building heartfelt relationships with all the members of a company. A good company should give its employees, customers and investors the opportunity to not only fulfill their basic needs but also to feel appreciated, that they belong and that they can make the world a better place.  Actionable advice: Be a dreammaker. Whether you’re an employee looking to find more enjoyment in your work, a boss wanting to create a better workplace or a dissatisfied customer wondering how to find the service you need, take the time to sit down and dream. What would your ideal world look like? Perhaps you can find ways to make those dreams come true.

How many did you think of? Probably quite a few; there are probably some fast food companies in there, maybe a few energy providers and definitely a few cellphone contractors!  Truth be told, many companies seem to drift toward the “dark side,” becoming disliked by customers for various reasons, be it the quality of their products, their dreadful customer service or their policies toward the environment and the developing world.  But it doesn’t have to be this way! These blinks show you why companies seem to turn “bad” and how they can avoid doing so. In fact, no company needs to get on our bad side – they just need to know what to do to remain our friends. In these blinks, you’ll discover why McDonald's lost their reputation for serving quality products; how Toyota reacted to its cars having a lethal malfunction; and why giving things away for free can lead to greater success. From banking to food, fashion to advertising, there’s no shortage of examples of how ugly, greedy and ruthless capitalism can become. Most of us just accept it as part of doing business. But did you ever really think about why companies go bad?  Of course, the story of corporations sacrificing their integrity for profit is as old as capitalism itself; very few corporations manage to maintain a clean reputation for their entire lifespan. The reality is that no company has ever been born either good or evil and stayed that way forever. Rather, most companies get caught up in an endless cycle.  So what does this cycle look like? Most companies move through predictable, successive stages of honesty, then efficiency, then deception and, ultimately, redemption – that is, if the business is fortunate enough to last that long.  In fact, many “bad companies” were actually industry leaders in their early days, but then lost sight of their clients’ interests somewhere along the way. A perfect example of this phenomenon is McDonald’s. Founded in 1950, the company’s motto was (believe it or not) “Quality, Service, Cleanliness and Value.” Yes, quality stood at the core of the company’s priorities, and it even drove the immediate success of the brand. Yet today, McDonald’s fights scandal after scandal, regularly sued by customers who blame hamburgers and French fries for their excessive weight. What happened? Well, somewhere along the way, the company moved into the efficiency section of the cycle and pushed quality and service into the background. Even so, most good companies are either still in their early stages and haven’t become twisted yet, or are old horses attempting to redeem a tattered public image. Looking at things this way, we can see that McDonald’s might not be dead and buried just yet. It could yet turn its image around and revert to its once-forgotten focus on quality. In the following blinks, we’ll investigate the phases that companies go through more closely, starting with their virtuous beginnings. Since companies indeed go through cycles, it means that no company starts out inherently bad – not even the corporation you hate most in the world. In fact, corporations begin their life cycle in a first stage called the honest era. Think of it this way: a newborn company is just like a baby – young, innocent and also quite weak. To survive its first years, the company can’t afford to play dirty; it has to convince its employees that the business is worth their efforts, and convince its consumers to give up their time and money. Take the Ford Motor Company. When it was founded in 1903, it was the first major organization to offer its employees a 40-hour workweek, health insurance programs and safety protections. The honest era is a time of people over profit, when everybody wins. Most Silicon Valley-based companies are still at this stage – they maintain an idyllic corporate image, offering free organic lunches and fitness.  The problem is that, as businesses grow, the pressure to stay competitive makes it harder to stick to honesty and quality. This is the efficient era. Sticking with the Ford example, it’s interesting to note that 50 years after its creation, the company had become known for its innovative management and production practices, while still valuing employees’ working conditions. But Ford had also begun to put more and more focus on productivity. After all, a business is only sustainable if it can stay ahead of its competitors, and that means being efficient. But problems arise when efficiency is no longer a means to an end, but the very goal being pursued. In the food industry, technical innovations – like growth enhancers, antibiotics and genetic modifications – were supposed to lead to greater yields, but actually turned many of the foods we consume into health hazards. In other words, the race to make food as efficient as possible overshadowed the original goal: to produce food! So what comes next after the first two phases? As you might have guessed, it starts to go downhill from here. Find out more in the next blink! Keeping your company steady during the efficient era is all well and good, but, as time goes by, it becomes all to tempting to drift over to the dark side. This is exactly what happens when a company enters the deceptive era. This is typically when companies decide to relocate production to developing countries (turning to child labor if necessary), implement misleading advertising campaigns, employ deceptive tactics, offer exorbitant salaries to executives and so on.  For example, by the 1970s, the Ford Motor Company’s founding values were a distant memory. After launching the now infamous Ford Pinto, the executive team, aware of the car’s life-threatening technical flaws, never opted for a global recall that would have prevented further incidents. Instead, they went for the cheapest alternative: leaving it on the market and settling in court with families of victims.  Although such ruthless decisions may lead to financial successes, they are short-lived; consumers start to wisen up and become dissatisfied.  The apologetic era is about restoring what’s been lost or broken on the way to corporate success: confidence, faith, quality and accountability. To do so, a company needs to right its wrongs by replacing misguided leaders and improving from the inside out. In the ‘90s, Ford began to make amends, investing in higher quality standards to increase customer satisfaction. And in 2009, while many of its competitors were kept afloat by government money, Ford released several advertisements explaining the company’s intent to pull through without bailout money. Even though consumers might first remain cautious, they are sensitive to admissions of guilt. In 2010, Toyota issued an apologetic statement admitting to mistakes that left one of their models with a lethally dangerous braking problem. The choice to apologize naturally helps rebuild the image of an organization that cares (as it did for Toyota) and a company can gradually regain consumers’ and employees’ trust. Out of all these phases, it’s clear that the first is the most appealing. If only it were possible for a business to remain in the honest era forever! Well, as it turns out, it might well be. The good news is there’s a way to remain in the honest era. How? Well, the companies who do manage to stay honest share seven core beliefs. The next blinks will break each of them down one by one. First off, people count. As obvious as it may seem, companies are made of people, not parts; these people are valuable and deserve to be treated with respect. To remain in the honest era, companies must treat three kinds of stakeholders right.   It starts with team members. When employee morale falls, the organization is not far from collapsing along with it. But if employees identify with their company and proudly carry coffee mugs with their company logo, they probably feel like they count! Next is customers. Customers need to feel special and valued; their complaints should be taken seriously and addressed with care and compassion. This is the exact ethic fueling Southwest Airlines’ innovative policy to not charge fees to customers who need to reschedule. Finally, vendors, though often overlooked, are also of critical importance. They’re the face of your company and should be treated accordingly. The second core belief is that truth matters. In his documentary Supersize Me, intending to expose the truth about the nutritional value of McDonald’s menus, Morgan Spurlock ate three McDonald’s meals a day for a whole month.  Besides the serious deterioration of his health, the documentary also highlights a current trend: the exposing of company lies. Nearly every piece of modern-day advertising features weasel words, hollow taglines that aren’t quite lies, but are still far from the truth. Though they think they’re being clever, it’s these businesses whose luck will eventually run out. Companies that refuse to meddle with the truth are the ones that will earn themselves a loyal customer base. Another important step toward keeping your business honest is, unsurprisingly, becoming more transparent. Sure, transparency can be tough, but you’ll be doing yourself a favor! Why? Because transparency is an act of liberation. Opting for full transparency is freeing. You can reinvest the time you’d otherwise spend concocting schemes and hiding secrets into optimizing your business. And consumers also are set free; they can engage with the company without speculating about its honesty, or lack thereof. The shoe manufacturer Timberland illustrates this concept. They committed to a plan for improving factory conditions, and set up a website for customers to monitor the company’s progress in real time. Bypassing transparency seems foolish in a world where any piece of information can be fact-checked online within seconds.  Also, resist the urge to be something else, and be authentic. But this doesn’t mean manufacturing authenticity through market research consultants! Nothing looks more fake than a company trying too hard to be real. Rather, authenticity means practicing what you preach. Take Baileys, which has been authentically Irish since its launch in 1974. Its “Irishness” is at the core of its success, as the company has always fought the urge to relocate its production. Baileys is manufactured in Ireland, and ensures only well-bred Irish dairy cows are involved in their production process.  With authenticity established, let’s take a look at another key value: generosity.  Running a business often seems like the opposite of generosity. But profit-hungry business strategies just won’t cut it for customers today. Generosity is a top priority, as the modern consumer doesn’t want to just buy a brand; they want to buy into the brand’s values, too.   Take the shoe brand TOMS. They were pioneers in the one-for-one model, where every pair of shoes purchased leads to an additional pair for a child in need. The eyewear company Warby Parker quickly followed suit, doing the same with glasses. Both have been very successful thanks to their policy of giving something back. There are two core values that every honest company needs, and the first one is a commitment to high quality. If you can achieve this, you’ll have a competitive edge, because quality speaks for itself. When you make high-quality products, it’s clear that your company values its customers. And quality also builds credibility. A well-designed website, the packaging of products or the choice of paper for a business card may all seem trivial, but each one contributes to the image that customers have of an organization. Customers are likely to think to themselves, “If they care that much about such details, I can trust that they’ll care about me as a client.” That being said, delivering quality might mean increasing prices, or decreasing profit margins. But prices and profit don’t matter as much as providing your customers with the right emotions.  Say you own a store. What kind of experience are you offering within this space? Do you want cheap lighting and fixtures that make the customer cringe, or do you want high quality surroundings that make them feel great? The second principle that honest companies stick to is facing fears. Fear takes different shapes and forms: it can appear as the fear of change, when you’re convinced that the policies and procedures that have brought success should never be modified, or it can manifest itself as a reluctance to admit faults. Don’t let fear fool you. Making amends is critical to moving forward – even Apple recognizes this.  When Apple’s Maps app tried and failed to compete with Google Maps, leading some users to completely wrong locations, Apple didn’t sweep their mistakes under the rug. Instead of ignoring complaints, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, had the courage to admit the company’s errors and issued a formal corporate apology. This proved a useful opportunity for Apple to prove that their company values honesty above all else. Now that we know how to do good, where do we begin? Start by acknowledging that the most powerful people are customers – and this means you are powerful. To break the cycle of good companies becoming bad, we have to learn to behave as consumers. Think of your last trip to the grocery store. Did you pay attention to the origins of goods? What about sustainable packaging? If your eyes were only focused on the price tags, it’s time to make a change. The average American household spends more than $50,000 per year in the marketplace, which shows how powerful consumers can be if they are educated and willing to act. If all Americans directed that money to companies in the honest era, these companies might not feel the need to move into the next stage of the cycle. If you’re ready to take the next step, now may be the time to launch your own company, club or nonprofit. In spite of what you might think, the timing is spot on. After an economic downturn, capable people who’ve just lost their jobs start looking for new ways to make money. And, rather than returning to their depressing cubicles to work for “the man,” they’re determined not to make those same mistakes which led to recession. Many even start their own endeavors. For this reason, it’s fair to assume that the current trend in social responsability is only beginning! So, without further ado, get started. Don’t get stuck in the “how to” phase: “How to create an online presence?”, “How to register for tax purposes?”, “How to set up a workable supply chain?” You’ll learn by doing, and not the other way around. You don’t need to wait to get a PhD in your field to be operational; just dive in and start making good things happen! The key message in this book: Capitalism is not merely a story of good and evil – it’s much more complex, with companies that start out with pure intentions becoming corrupted along the way. This pattern, however, can be avoided by learning from past mistakes and developing a fresh new economic model where people, not profits, are of greatest importance.  Actionable advice: To provide quality, you need ears to hear, so create a culture of evaluation and feedback.  In the end, quality is not what you say it is, but what your clients say it is. Don’t follow the path of companies that ask customers to answer a “short survey” and then don’t respond to their feedback. These companies are not listening and refuse to improve. You should listen, respond and make changes quickly. Use your social media platforms effectively and make sure your clients are pleased!

The answer is obvious: great technology. Wrong! In Peopleware, authors Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister make the case that the most important aspect of software development is actually human, and not technical. You’ll discover that understanding the role of people in software development is crucial. This means that as a project manager, you’ll need to focus on issues such as teamwork, developer productivity and group dynamics; only then can you lead your development team toward success. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why team spirit requires a margin for error; why forced overtime leads to compensatory undertime; and how gardening can set an amicable tone among employees. Work done in the field of creative software development is largely project-based. Yet unfortunately, many of these projects crash and burn with many a manager scratching her head as to why. Indeed, companies undertake countless projects that are doomed to failure. In studies that looked at some 500 different software development projects from real companies, the authors observed that 15 percent of projects were either canceled or never ended up being used. Moreover, for larger and more time-consuming projects, specifically those that lasted 25 or more work-years, 25 percent remained incomplete. In studying these failed projects, the authors found that they couldn’t be explained by failures in technology. In fact, the majority of failed projects had no technological problems at all. Rather, the reasons for failure were sociological – that is, they involved the teams that worked on the projects. Unfortunately, most managers don’t address this aspect of project management, because of an erroneous understanding of their role in the business. To illustrate this, imagine you’re a manager out with your team of programmers at a cocktail party, and another party-goer asks you what you “do for a living.” How do you respond? If you answer, “I’m in software programming,” then you’ve already got it wrong! Managers, even those who manage teams that do technological work, are mostly in the human communication business. Their success, therefore, is derived from positive human interactions within their teams. Managers who don’t understand this central aspect of their job are more likely to manage inefficiently and make their workers unhappy, and thereby diminish the quality of their work. Thus, if you want to be a successful project manager – even in a highly technical field such as software development – you have to place a strong focus on people, not technology, management. The fact that so few managers don’t really understand the purpose of their position is made evident by the several common mistakes managers make when managing their team. First, they see their workers only as being cogs in a machine – essentially interchangeable and uniform, and don’t recognize the unique differences between employees. For example, in one study the authors came across a case of a “less perceptive” manager at a software company. This manager oversaw a very talented employee with an unusual expense account. The manager found that this employee was spending 50 percent more money on food than other workers. However, he wasn’t spending more money overall; whatever extra money he spent on food, he was saving somewhere else. Thus, he wasn’t actually more expensive, just different. Nevertheless, the manager felt threatened and branded the employee as a “food criminal” in a public memo. This lack of consideration for human differences can only lead to poor morale! The second big mistake managers make is that they don’t leave room for employees to make mistakes. Managers often perceive errors as seriously grave, a mind-set that they then pass on to employees as well. For example, when the authors introduced a group of software managers to the concept of iterative design, most felt their bosses wouldn’t accept this new strategy. Iterative design involves rejecting defect-prone designs and starting fresh; the employees believed that, since their manager wouldn’t suffer errors, that this new design strategy would be a tough sell. Even though repairing older versions of defective software is often more costly in the long run, the manager would nonetheless not want to reject a design entirely, as the company had already paid for the time and labor it took to build it. As a result, employees are less likely to try innovative designs out of fear that they might turn out badly, opting instead to play it safe to avoid possible repercussions. This too can cause morale to suffer. Managers want to get the most out of their employees. But what’s the best way to go about it? A manager can always try to make employees work longer hours, and perhaps spend a weekend at the office, right? While this is often a manager’s prefered strategy, it’s actually counterproductive. We are all keenly aware of our limited time here on this earth. Despite being told to “work harder,” we see the toll that this increased workload takes on our families. Our loved ones don’t like it when we spend long hours at the office, and we end up missing out on a lot of quality time. As a result, overtime will often lead employees to take compensatory undertime whenever possible, either through suboptimal work, leaving early, getting sick and so on. In essence, overtime is like sprinting: it’s great for the final stretch, but if you sprint for too long, you won’t be able to finish the race. What’s more, too much mandatory overtime can also lead to higher employee turnover. The decreased job satisfaction that comes with overtime often causes employees to leave the company in search of better working conditions. Take the “Eagle Project” at Data General as an example. During the project, “workaholic project members” put in lots of unpaid overtime hours to get things done, and other employees followed suit as to not look bad. However, after the project’s completion, the entire development staff quit! When measuring productivity, you have to think in terms of benefit divided by cost: if you stand to benefit from savings due to unpaid overtime, then you should also consider the cost of replacing worn-out employees when you calculate productivity Think about a project that was dear to you. Perhaps it was a picture you drew as a child, or maybe an essay that you wanted to get just right. Whatever it was, you would have surely been upset if someone came along and yanked the project from your desk, when you were only halfway finished! These days, lots of employees feel the same way about their own projects. For example, buyers can often live with a program with minor errors, as long as the program is functional. Even if some buyers choose not to buy, such products often remain profitable as programmers have saved money during production, by cutting down the time-to-market. This willingness to accept a decrease in quality for similar decrease in time-to-market is called the flight from excellence. While it does bring the immediate benefit of a faster time-to-market, it comes with a hidden cost. While managers and customers might be okay with a lower-quality product, great computer programmers would rather create programs they can take pride in. If they’re constantly pressured to build lower-quality products quickly, they’ll become unhappy and eventually quit their job. You, as a manager, are then stuck looking for a replacement. In contrast, workers that are happy with their work will also be more productive in the long run. Consider Hewlett-Packard, a company famous for its high quality standards, set by employees who actually build the programs. It’s no surprise that the company is also famous for its productivity. HP programmers deliver quality beyond what the market requires. As a result, employees identify strongly with their work, as well as enjoy high job satisfaction, and the company in turn enjoys low turnover. This helps HP to stay profitable, showing that quality and productivity are not tradeoffs, but can be two sides of the same coin. Creating good work, however, starts with having the right environment. The following blinks will show how to create a work environment that’s actually conducive to work. Think about your office: Are the phones constantly ringing? Are people up and about? Are there just too many distractions to get things done? If this sounds familiar, then it might be time to change your office setup so that your employees can feel more at ease and actually get some work done. The workplace has by far the greatest impact on worker performance – higher than even education or experience. The authors verified this during their “Coding War Games,” which aimed to measure productivity among different companies. Each company involved in the games nominated two employees to participate, and each two-person team was tasked with coding and testing a medium-sized program, and was to log the time spent on their work, which could only be done during normal working hours. The authors then measured whether factors such as programming language, years of experience, salary and workplace had an effect on the time competitors needed to complete their task. The result: workplace, far greater than programming language, experience and even salary, had the greatest impact on worker performance. This all leaves us wondering: How do effective workplaces differ from ineffective ones? Essentially, effective workplaces are bigger, quieter and have fewer interruptions. The workers who performed in the study’s top quartile had more space for their work, an average of 78 square feet. Within this group: 57 percent said that their workspace was acceptably quiet; 62 percent reported that it was acceptably private; 52 percent were allowed to silence their phones; 76 percent were able to divert their calls; and only 38 percent reported being needlessly interrupted. Contrast this with the workers in the bottom quartile, who had only 46 square feet worth of working space, and 76 percent of whom were often interrupted. Can you remember the last time you were so engrossed in a task that your work felt like the most simple, natural thing in the world? This feeling that creative workers get when they are truly immersed in their work is called flow, defined as a “condition of deep, nearly meditative involvement” with a gentle sense of euphoria, and it’s essential in doing our best work. Flow comes with a deep concentration that helps us work better, faster and with more enthusiasm, making it especially important for creative work. Despite flow’s critical importance, we don’t often give it the respect it deserves. Think about it: when we measure productivity, we’re often measuring body time, that is, the time in which people are physically present at work. That says nothing about the brain time they actually put in, or the time spent in flow. If your employees measure the hours they spend working in flow, the result will inevitably be smaller than their body time, since flow is destroyed by interruptions. So, you need a way to enable flow. One way is to ensure that your office has doors for privacy and phones that can be silenced. Telephones are noisy, demand attention and thus interrupt flow. So, by encouraging your workers to quiet their phones for hours at a time, you allow them to spend more time in a flow state and thus be more productive. You’ll also need to arrange the workspace in a way that allows both private space with a door, meeting space and social space, thus enabling your employees to both work in solitude or interact with one another. One manager interviewed by the authors recalls his time at Bell Labs, where he worked in a spacious two-person office and was allowed to turn off his phone. His colleague sometimes would sit at his desk, immersed in thought – something which wouldn’t have been possible with the hustle and bustle of a normal office. Surely you’ve heard stories about what it’s like to work at Google. The company has a reputation for creating a pleasant, fun and unique working environment that delights employees. But there’s a reason Google tries so hard to keep its employees happy. As a manager, you should strive to maintain a mentality of permanence. This means you should be proactive in keeping your personnel for as long as possible, by fostering a sense of community among workers and investing in them over the long term. For example, as a manager, you should be consciously striving to be the best in your own field and discuss your determination with your team to create a unified vision. You should also foster community activities unrelated to work, to further create a shared sense of community. The magazine Reader’s Digest, for example, did this by setting up community gardens for employees, and found that gardening together created an amicable atmosphere within the company. By taking an interest in their workers’ well-being and investing in them for the long term, companies increase their chances of keeping workers over longer periods. But why would companies even want to do this? In essence, turnover costs are very expensive, so you might as well avoid them. Think about it: if the average employee works at your company from somewhere between 15 and 36 months, then you’ll typically lose between 33 and 80 percent of your workforce every year to turnover. Now consider that it costs around 1.5 months’ salary to onboard a new employee, and until he’s up to speed on how things work, you can expect a few months of negative output, both from him and those that have to take time away from their work to help him find his bearings. This adds up: all in all, the authors estimate that 20 percent of all manpower expenses are turnover costs. Now that you know how to create a great working environment, our final blinks will show you how to assemble your “wonder team.” If you’ve ever worked in a team in which everyone and everything just “clicked,” then you know just how pleasant as well as productive these kinds of environments can be. As a manager, it’s your responsibility to ensure nothing comes in the way of encouraging this sort of positive team atmosphere. One particular problem that can arise, however, is when managers work to protect themselves from their team’s failures. This sort of strategy is called defensive management, and it almost always backfires. The author recalls an anecdote about a consultant, who noticed that his project group wasn’t asking for feedback from one of their clients. The problem wasn’t the team but rather their manager, who insisted on communicating with the client himself. The manager, however, was so swamped by his own work that he simply didn’t have the time to get to the client’s feedback. His lack of trust in his team regarding client interactions resulted in a loss in efficiency, and in the end, certainly didn’t protect him from his team’s failures! Another problem is bureaucracy, which is both time-consuming and detrimental to team solidarity. In fact, studies show that bureaucracy, like a complicated filing system or the overly extensive documentation of work processes, accounts for as much as 30 percent of a product’s production costs. Bureaucracy itself does little to advance projects, as it mostly just documents work that has already been done. If you want your team to “click,” then they have to rally behind your cause, and it’s hard to motivate them to do that when they’re filing papers all the time. No two workers are the same, and as such, no two are equally skilled at any given task. However, this shouldn’t be taken to mean that less-skilled team members bring down the group. Rather, a team’s success depends less on individual skill and more on priorities. If a team prioritizes quality, then employees will eventually create a team that is greater than the sum of its parts. For example, you may have heard the popular tale about a company which consistently had a problem with software errors, or “bugs,” that had proved elusive for programmers to remove. Then a team of skilled software testers was formed, which became known as the Black Team. After a year, the Black Team developed a personality of its own: the group placed heavy emphasis on product quality and tried to develop the hardest tests imaginable for software in development. It got to the point where presenting your code to the Black Team was frightening, because of their high standards! The Black Team accomplished two things: the team itself improved programs by detecting and removing bugs, and the other programmers tried to write the best possible programs to pass muster. When the initial Black Team members were replaced by new employees, the recruits almost immediately adopted the attitudes and spirit of the Black Team. Eventually, none of its initial members remained, yet the Black Team – driven by a shared vision for quality – still continued to perform well. Another force that binds teams together is a shared sense of eliteness. Members of the Black Team started wearing black clothes, and made a point of coming up with more punishing, outrageous tests for software to boost their sense of eliteness. They enjoyed their work so much that other employees even became envious of them. As a result, members of the Black Team felt it was an honor to be on the team, which only increased their sense of solidarity. Would you rather work in a place where you can be yourself, or in one where you feel like you have to fit into a mold? Unless you are a robot, individuality is important. It’s no different with your project teams. Indeed, heterogeneity is crucial for team building. In part, having a diverse team signals to your employees that it’s okay to be different, to think differently and to come up with unique ideas and solutions. For example, when your team includes a co-op student, an ex-admin and a handicapped developer, their differences signal that everyone has a role and is important, and that aspiring to be a “corporate mold of Uniform Plastic Person” is not what your company is about. This ability to express individuality is important not only for worker happiness but also in forming a cohesive team. The members of this heterogenous team, just like all other human beings, will need the feeling of accomplishment from time to time. You should accommodate this by structuring work into manageable chunks. Think about it: If you’re working on a project that will take four years to complete without recognizing any of the successes along the way, chances are you might think, “I could be dead before this thing is ever done!” This feeling is not motivating, especially if team members meet regularly. Thus, it’s important for them to celebrate the small successes along the way. This will get them into the habit of succeeding together, which will build momentum and help increase camaraderie. Not only that, but celebrating the completion of each piece of a project will give team members renewed energy to take the next steps. Now that you’ve finished these blinks, it’s time to take a moment to celebrate your next step on the path to becoming a great project manager! The key message in this book: The best project managers don’t manage technology or even the project itself. Instead, they manage people! Project managers need to treat employees as individuals and help them to form great teams, so a company can get the best work out of them. Actionable advice: Turn off your phone, and have your team do the same. The next time you have to get some important work done, disconnect your telephone. Working without interruptions can help you get into a flow state, which will help you to get more things done and get more enjoyment out of work. Suggested further reading: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni The Five Dysfunctions of a Team presents the notion that teams are inherently dysfunctional, so deliberate steps must be taken to facilitate great teamwork. A knowledgeable team leader can do a great deal to make his or her team effective, and the book outlines practical tools for achieving this.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

But they don’t all agree on how to stay afloat in these lightning-paced times. These blinks present entertainment giant Netflix’s survival techniques, which are driven by eight central management practices. By adopting these practices, you may well give your company the edge that Netflix continues to enjoy, whether your business is just starting out or figuring out how to surge ahead of the competition. You’ll also learn why managers should listen to employees; the downside of the annual review system; and that working for Yahoo! won’t prepare you for life at Netflix. If you’re a business manager, then you know that efficiency is key to success. And you probably have a set of procedures and policies that keep things efficient – a strict workflow that ensures relevant issues are brought to your attention as quickly as possible. But what if you were to learn that rigid structuring and inflexible procedures, though supposedly making your business more efficient, were, in fact, making it less so? In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing market, it’s best to make your business lean – that is, as procedure-free and structureless as possible. The first step toward leanness is to jettison the traditional, top-down management that’s hog-tying most businesses. The goal is to be as agile as possible, and if employees must seek your approval or opinion whenever a decision needs to be made, your business will become stiff and sluggish – the opposite of what it should be. Netflix is an excellent example of corporate nimbleness. With grace and speed, they adapted to the changing needs of viewers, transitioning from a by-mail DVD-rental company to a top-notch streaming service. This nimble adaptation would have been impossible had the company been mired in outmoded management protocols. But perhaps your company relies on various fixed policies, such as rewards or bonuses, to incentivize employees, and you worry that removing this structure will damage their motivation. Well, worry not. If workers feel that they’re part of a strong team and that their contributions truly matter, they’ll be more motivated than ever. And the best way to build driven teams is to give workers the freedom to solve problems and tackle projects in their own way. Indeed, once you loosen the reins, your employees may start producing even better results, because making a real contribution to important projects is a reward in and of itself. This certainly happened at Netflix. In 2001, the company experienced major economic difficulties and was forced to lay off a third of its workers. The remaining employees, all of whom were highly talented, were forced to take on more responsibilities and work, which proved quite beneficial. Now that each person’s work made a major difference, everyone put in much more effort – and Netflix was soon on its way to recovery. Imagine you’re at the edge of a raging river. You want to get to the other side, but there’s only a wooden footbridge and, for all you know, the wood is rotten and will break the moment you put weight on it. Well, if you don’t constantly communicate with employees and management, your business will be like that bridge – a potentially flimsy structure that might plunge you straight into the rapids of bankruptcy. The only way to know what challenges your employees are currently facing, what goals your teams are pursuing or what changes the market is undergoing is to talk about it. So, to make sure everyone is on the same page, take a tip from Netflix’s CEO and cofounder, Reed Hastings: with a PowerPoint presentation, explain how the business works to each new hire. This method proved so successful at Netflix that the company now has a “new employee college,” a quarterly meeting during which each department head brings all company employees up to speed on what’s happening in their department. This gives employees the chance to ask questions and thereby obtain a better understanding of how the business works – an understanding that’s important because communication shouldn’t only be top-down. Employees should have the freedom to communicate their thoughts and critiques to management as well. Just consider how things work at Netflix’s new employee college, where employees can ask managers pretty much anything, from how new management decisions are made to exactly what’s expected of new hires. Once, during one of these Q&A sessions, an employee raised a question about the film-distribution system, which, in the employee’s view, was inconvenient. This question raised a doubt in the manager’s mind. Though he’d adopted the system recently, he soon began to rethink it and, eventually, this reconsideration led to Netflix’s trademark distribution method – the simultaneous release of all of a series’ episodes. What if, unbeknownst to you, your breath reeked of garlic? Or what if, without really realizing it, you habitually picked your nose when deep in thought? Would you want your coworkers to politely ignore such pungent or unsightly details? Or would you rather have the tough news delivered to your face so that you could mend your ways? Though potentially painful, radical honesty is extremely beneficial, because it creates an atmosphere of transparency that’s conducive to continuous learning and growth – an atmosphere that politer policies will never lead to. For instance, take Eric Colson, a Netflix team leader who used to work at Yahoo!, a company that asks coworkers to support – that is, never criticize – one another. Netflix, in contrast, encourages radical honesty, and life there was initially shocking for Colson. For instance, a coworker once informed him that the content he was creating was too muddled, a comment that riled Colson at first, but later gave him food for thought and an opportunity for improvement. His communication skills gradually improved, and he quickly began to take on greater responsibilities and more important roles at the company. Now, radical honesty doesn’t mean you should just say everything that flits through your mind; hard truths should be delivered with respect and evenhandedness. This, of course, is easier said than done, especially when emotions are running high, so be sure to practice. Work out exactly what you want to say, and then deliver your lines to your partner or say them in front of the mirror. This will help you hone your tone and body language, which will make a huge difference when you deliver your critique to your coworker. Also, don’t make your criticism personal, and be sure to offer actionable advice going forward. You’re asking for a change in behavior, not an alteration of personality. For instance, if you were to say to a coworker, “You don’t focus,” he’d probably take it as a personal attack and have no idea how to remedy the situation. It’s more actionable, and less personal, to say, “I see you work hard and greatly appreciate it, but sometimes I see you spending too much time on unimportant tasks, which prevents you from getting to the truly important ones.” It’s often thought that debate is a sign of discord, and that debate within a business is a symptom of corporate disunity. But this isn’t the case at all. As long as people’s opinions are based in fact, debate is extremely generative and should be encouraged. Constructive debate, far from causing corporate division, is the best way to enliven a company. It introduces new points of view and keeps workers from getting too fixed in their work habits. It should thus be heartily encouraged. Keep in mind, however, that all opinions should be fact-based. Otherwise, the suavest rhetorician will always win the debate, no matter how slapdash her argument. At Netflix, facts are highly prized, and they undergird all arguments and important decisions. But it wasn’t always that way. Netflix once struggled with overlong video-buffering times, and sales and marketing personnel, who had to deal with disgruntled customers, would often hound the company’s engineers, telling them to fix the problem right away. But the engineers couldn’t just fix such a technically complex issue. It was at this point that the importance of fact-based debate dawned on managers. Sales and marketing should have been asking why it wasn’t easy to reduce buffering times, because, without the facts, all they could do was complain to and irritate the engineers. But a word of warning: don’t mistake data for facts. Sure, data does sometimes reflect the facts, but not always. So, it’s important to consider other variables that data sets simply can’t communicate. For example, take Netflix’s decision to launch House of Cards. It got the green light not only because data showed that viewers liked the lead actors, but because David Fincher, one of America’s preeminent directors and producers, had signed on – a fact that the data didn’t reflect. We’ve all heard that we should enjoy the moment because the present is all we have. And while that might be sound personal advice, in the world of business, it would be foolhardy not to look toward the future. More specifically, you should always hire the team you know you’ll want to work with in the future too. Oddly enough, though managers are usually good at projecting how products and services will meet the demands of future customers and developing markets, they aren’t so adept at building teams that will evolve well. Rather, they look at their team’s current shortcomings and hire to fill the gaps. This isn’t a great approach, and here’s why: if you only ever consider current performance – which can lead to overhiring, underhiring or, worse still, hiring the wrong people – your business will never reach its full potential. This problem can be obviated, however, by asking yourself what you want your team to look like in six months. Shut your eyes and envision the optimal team. Make a list of all the things that differentiate this team from your current one. Maybe they’ve developed some exciting new product prototypes, or have managed to make your software 99-percent bug-free. Now ask yourself how they got there. Was it through increased collaborative efforts, or more solitary work? Was a new team leader onboarded? Are there more, or fewer, meetings? Are there more intradepartmental efforts? Then figure out how to improve team members’ skill sets so they can achieve these results. Do they need to improve communication or become more disciplined? Are they listening to one another? Does an ace negotiator need to join the team? By asking yourself such questions, you’ll soon have a profile of a solid team that can rise to future challenges and meet changing needs. This, in turn, will help you decide what to do, and who to hire, in the present. Once you know what you want your team to look like in general, you can get down to the details of hiring individual team members, which is what we’ll look at next. More often than not, hiring goes hand in hand with firing. So what’s the most effective way to bring people on and let people go? Well, here are some helpful pointers: Employee retention shouldn’t be used as a metric of hiring success; the only yardstick for successful hiring is how talented your team members are. Most companies believe, erroneously, that retention is a fantastic way to measure their team-building success. But here’s the thing: companies must constantly adapt to the ever-changing demands of the market, and it follows that employees who no longer fit well with a company’s new direction or approach must be let go. So, regardless of how much you like a person or the excellent job she’s done, you must continuously reevaluate whether that person is truly the perfect fit for her position. Netflix is an unwavering proponent of this philosophy, which has been central to their growth and ability to innovate. They school all hiring managers in it, and you should too. Netflix also makes sure that everyone in HR commands a deep understanding of the business, even when things get technical and complex. As you doubtless know, it’s HR’s task to find and suggest potential hires to hiring managers. And so, if HR has no clue what the business is truly about, one shouldn’t be surprised when they fail to suggest quality candidates for specific positions. Many companies forget to make HR an integral part of their overall functioning. But remember: HR is responsible for finding the people that will serve as a company’s foundation, and this central role shouldn’t be ignored. Netflix certainly understands how fundamental HR is to future success; indeed, one of their hiring recruiters once saved the day when the company was negotiating a deal with Nintendo. Netflix only had had eight months to finalize a product for the Nintendo Wii, but no current team was up to the task, meaning a new one had to be formed. With a mere eight months until the deadline, this was no small challenge. Luckily, Bethany Brodsky, a dedicated recruiter, went the extra mile for the company: she familiarized herself with all the technicalities of the task and, armed with this knowledge, was able to build the perfect team, enabling the product to launch on time. Have you ever tried to resell anything? Maybe an old smartphone or laptop or car? It’s not so hard to calculate an asking price, right? All you have to do is go online, figure out how much that particular model is worth and – presto! – you’ve got a price tag. People are a bit harder to put a price on. But here’s a tip to make the calculation of employee worth a little bit easier. First, don’t merely consider the salary itself; rather, determine how much value an employee will create later on. Let’s say you’re looking to hire a new engineer, but your top choice has been offered way more – let’s say $20,000 per year more – by your main competitor. That might seem like a massive difference, but, before you politely decline to match the competitor’s offer, consider the future. Does this engineer possess a rare set of skills and experiences that will significantly increase revenue? Or maybe your second-choice candidate, unlike your first, can’t begin immediately? Or perhaps it’s worth spending an extra $20,000 to deprive the competition of this brilliant talent? When hiring, you’ve got to take such things into account. Basing your compensation offering on a simple salary survey is a mistake because it won’t give you the full picture – just a baseline figure. It’s up to you to adjust that figure to accommodate added value down the road. Furthermore, it might seem logical, and fair, to use performance reviews to determine a person’s pay. But here’s the wrench in the works: such systems – with a good review meaning more money and a poor one leading to less – usually rely on automation. A computer, after being fed the performance-review information, calculates how much a person should be paid, a number that falls within preset pay ranges and is relative to other company results. This method of calculating remuneration is inherently unfair since it utterly fails to take into account skills that are rare or in high demand, among other factors. This morning, you gave the presentation of a lifetime – and you nailed it. The audience was utterly captivated, laughed at your jokes and shouted and applauded when you finished. Now it’s evening, and it suddenly hits you: they were laughing at you, and those shouts were taunting, that applause derisive. Well, to avoid employees having such unpleasant and delayed realizations, you need to give employees feedback constantly. Instead of doing an annual performance review, hold one-on-one meetings with employees on a semi-regular basis. Giving a single, annual review means that managers and employees only get one chance for real improvement per year. It’s much more effective to give people the opportunity to adjust whenever needed rather than informing them in December that, back in April, they did something wrong. Unless there’s clear data indicating that annual reviews are benefitting your business, you’d do well to jettison the annual review system entirely. Frequent one-on-one meetings also make it easy for you to assess employee qualifications and abilities, and decide whether anyone is failing to adapt to company changes. If someone no longer seems to be a good fit, he should be let go. Here’s a tough truth: a person needn’t be a sloppy worker or a total jerk in order to be a poor fit. Indeed, he might be a solid worker and a great guy – but that doesn’t mean he’s still right for the job. Perhaps changes in the market have caused tasks to change and, because of this, he’s no longer a top performer and doesn’t have the wherewithal to become one. If this is the case, you needn’t create a plan for improvement. It’s best to simply let the person go and find someone else who can be a high performer. The key message in this book: You can create a high-performance culture in your company by getting rid of traditional top-down management hierarchies and senseless bureaucracy. Encourage debate and communication, build teams with the future in mind, surround yourself with top talent and go beyond salary surveys to calculate compensation. By implementing these principles and instating a work culture of freedom, responsibility, transparency and honest debate, you’ll be well on your way toward happy employees and a successful business.    Got feedback?

Cold cash? Great perks? Well, would you work in a job you totally hated, for example, if you were compensated very well? Probably not. So what exactly motivates you – and in turn, everyone else who suffers through the 9-to-5? Business leaders know that if you want to create a high-performing culture within an organization, you have to discover what motivates your teams. Because if you can’t tap into the ideas or feelings that inspire your employees, they won’t perform – and your company won’t succeed. These blinks draw on more than 20 years of business know-how, explaining the various shades of human motivation, how it works and how you can harness its power to build a successful company. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should inspire your employees with the motive of play; why adaptive goals beat tactical goals; and why Toyota decided to involve employees in the entire process of building cars. What gets you out of bed every morning, ready for another productive day at the office? When you’re working to build a high-performance culture at your company, this should be the first question on your mind. In fact, motivation can be broken down into three categories: play, purpose and potential.  Play motivates you to take an action simply because it is fun to do so. You might be curious and enjoy experimenting, or simply eager to learn or adapt. This is why people spend time enjoying a hobby, solving crossword puzzles or listening to music. But in turn, if you’re trying to do something difficult like losing weight, play motivation can help; you might enjoy trying new recipes or researching vegetarian restaurants to reach your goal. Purpose motivates you to do something because you value the outcome and impact of your actions, even though the process itself may not be enjoyable. The long shifts and stressful days of being a nurse may be tough, for example, but deep down you value caring for people. Potential motivates you when you value the indirect outcomes of a certain activity. In essence, you think that your actions will lead to something important, such as fulfilling a long-term goal. If you were a paralegal, for example, you might not enjoy the day-to-day work, but you see the job as a necessary step toward applying to law school. So now you know the three types of motivation. The more closely these three are connected to the work you do, the more strongly they’ll influence your overall performance. Of the three, play is the most powerful motivator as it’s closest to the work itself. This means the more you see your work as play, the better you’ll perform! But don’t ignore purpose and potential – they’re still strong motivators! Now that you know how people are motivated, it might seem like the more of these motives you provide for your team, the more dedicated they’ll be. However, that’s not quite how it works. When motives aren’t directly connected to work, they reduce performance. More specifically, emotional pressure, economic pressure and inertia are indirect motivators that can have this effect. Emotional pressure happens when emotions related to your self-perception or judgment of others cause you to take certain actions. Such emotions might be guilt, disappointment or shame. For instance, you might practice piano because you’re scared of disappointing your mother, or stay at a job you dislike simply because your position and title boost your self-confidence. Economic pressure motivates by encouraging you to seek rewards or avoid punishment. Many workers clock overtime hours to earn a bonus, get a promotion or simply keep a job. Inertia motivates you to do something today simply because you did it yesterday. In cases of inertia, it’s difficult to identify why you’re even doing the work in question. An executive might keep working late because he can’t think of a reason to go home; a college student might keep studying just because it’s the path he’s already begun. Such motives can be problematic. The more important they are for your reasons for working, the more damage they can cause. Emotional pressure is the weakest of indirect motives; economic pressure is stronger; and inertia is the most debilitating to overall performance. Inertia makes you get work done, but deprives you of knowing why you do it, day in and day out. Performance isn’t just about accomplishing tasks effectively. In this rapidly changing business world, performance is also measured in a company’s ability to adapt. This is called adaptive performance. This describes a company’s flexibility, or its ability to break with a set plan to seize new opportunities, markets or other surprises. But how does your company become adaptive? A working culture that encourages creativity and problem solving will adapt to change effortlessly. Adaptive performance can be boosted through direct motives of play, purpose and potential. Professor Adam Grant conducted a study in which he asked students to generate ideas for how a band could earn income. One group, primed with play and purpose motives, was told that the exercise would be fun, and that band members need money to support their families. Another group was told the exercise would be boring and that the band was financially secure and just playing music for kicks. So what happened? The first group produced ideas that were considered 30 percent more creative by independent music experts. Adaptive performance isn’t all that matters. Tactical performance describes a person’s ability to execute a plan. This works by helping you focus your energy on essential goals, such as increasing sales. Tactical and adaptive performance are complementary, and both are necessary for success. But while both forces are crucial to overall performance, companies often focus just on the tactical, as it’s easier to measure. As a result, adaptive performance tends to fall by the wayside. It’s easy to chart the rise and fall of sales, for example. But it’s harder to measure whether the company entered a new market quickly enough. Even so, companies need to pay more attention to their adaptive performance. It’s time to change! Managing your company’s culture is just like managing its finances – it’s an ongoing process that requires careful diagnostics. Luckily there’s a tool that can help you measure your company’s culture and its performance. It’s called ToMo – and you’re about to learn all about it! Are you ready to boost your company’s adaptive performance? This is where Total Motivation or ToMo comes in. This tool measures a company’s adaptability by using the six motives we’ve reviewed in previous blinks. Here’s how ToMo works. First, you need to calculate your current ToMo by analyzing the six motives. The authors have designed several methods for doing so. The simplest method consists of six statements which responders can agree or disagree with, such as “I continue to work at my current job because the work itself is fun to do” and “I continue to work at my current job because without this job I would be worried I couldn’t reach my financial objectives.” Next, you use this data to identify the areas where your company’s ToMo can be improved, marking the areas in which adaptive performance is most essential. These areas tend to be those with direct customer engagement, that influence product quality or that require creativity. Once you’ve done this, you choose the optimal individualized strategy for your company’s situation. To do so, take a look at your research and determine how you can boost the three positive motives while reducing indirect motives in your areas of focus. Next, you set your desired ToMo to start building a company culture that motivates your employees using the ideas you identified in the previous step. Here’s a benchmark metric that might help you. Research has found that companies renowned for their great corporate culture tend to have a ToMo score – which ranges from -100 to 100 – about 15 points higher than the industry standard. Finally, generate a plan to implement your desired company culture in areas that produce specific outcomes. After all, you’ve got limited investment capital, and it’s essential that the money you spend on building a corporate culture increases your economic performance. ToMo is strongly correlated to customer experience, an area that often has a direct connection to profits, customer retention rate and cross sales. One study found that the difference in revenue generated by a salesperson with positive ToMo and another with negative ToMo was 28 percent! Increasing your company’s ToMo can help employees perform better and become more adaptive. But to do this effectively, you need leaders who demonstrate and encourage such behavior by always pushing the direct motives of play, purpose and potential. How can a company leader do this? To encourage play, leaders should inspire curiosity and experimentation within the workforce. By doing so, they can pique employees’ interest and get them involved in work. Employees, freed from rigid instructions or heavy-handed codes of conduct, will be happy to work on projects that excite them. To stimulate purpose, leaders should emphasize shared values and common goals among employees. Be sure to explain the positive outcomes your company will inspire and how customers will benefit. To inspire potential, leaders need to help connect employee work to personal goals and needs. Focus on employee strengths, and on teaching and coaching them; treat everyone as a valuable individual. The idea is that a leader shows employees that their investment in the company is an investment in themselves. But this isn’t all a good leader needs to do. Leaders also need to discourage indirect motives, such as emotional and economic pressures. It’s up to a leader to assure employees that the company has set reasonable goals that they can feel confident pursuing. Setting reasonable goals can remove unnecessary emotional pressure, allowing employees to focus on more positive motivation.   A leader also needs to translate tactical goals into adaptive ones. For example, if a tactical goal is to increase market share by 30 percent, the adaptive equivalent would be to learn five new strategies for boosting market share in general. This works. In a study, one group of students was given a tactical goal and another an adaptive goal. The tactical group lost eight percent of its market share while the adaptive group grew its business by 59 percent! Most jobs are based on tactical performance, meaning people have specific instructions on how to perform. It’s rare for a position to be centered on inspiring adaptive performance and total motivation. This is a shame; here’s how to institute change. To inspire an employee to deliver an adaptive performance, his job description needs to show him how he can make an impact, inspire him to have fun in his work and help him prioritize the work by himself. So the first thing you should do is ensure employees witness the effects of their work. Accomplishing this is as easy as familiarizing an employee with the entire process of his department. In other words, show him how his actions, as well as those of the company, produce an output. As a result, the employee will self-identify ways to improve his performance. Toyota, for instance, rotates employee jobs in its factories so that everyone understands the car-building process from start to finish. Understanding this helps employees improve their performance and shows them how their work interacts with and bolsters that of others. As a leader, it’s also essential to encourage the play motive. You can do so by opening up opportunities for employees to generate new, improved ideas. Clerks at Whole Foods Market, a grocery chain, are allotted time to meet local producers, speak with customers and visit competing stores so they can generate new ideas for the company. You should always make sure employees can prioritize their tasks. Prioritizing isn’t just about deciding when to do something – it’s about deciding which tasks require the approval of a higher-up. This is essential. If employees can prioritize on their own, they’ll be more likely to try out new ideas, which can be rapidly tested. On the other hand, if employees can’t see the line between their realm of authority and actions in need of approval, they’ll be unlikely to act on their ideas. There’s no single source of Total Motivation. Rather, it’s a combination of aspects that includes a company’s attitude toward its visions and values, as well as its promotion hierarchy. A good strategy is to build a common identity within your company that changes jobs into callings. A common identity is formed when a group holds a common objective, a code of behavior and a heritage.  A common objective should bring your team together, inspire them and explain a group’s purpose. A behavioral code should empower people to solve problems and make decisions. Instead of listing values like honesty or integrity, your code should define exactly how decisions are made. For instance, it might answer the question, “Should customer experience be prioritized over sales targets?” Your company’s heritage is about living by company values. This is done by sharing real examples in which the company lived up to its identity. But building a common identity isn’t all that’s necessary. You’ll also need to avoid tactical performance increases by individualizing promotion ladders. For instance, some companies think that competition among employees is good, but in such situations, charting a career path can look like a tournament with employees competing for slots. Studies show that when people are competing for promotions they seek out easy, low-risk tasks that make them look busy. They avoid problem-solving and opportunities for creativity. As a result, people focus more on landing a promotion than on producing results, choosing tactical performance over adaptive performance. This can be avoided through individualized career ladders. To implement such a strategy, it’s essential to not automatically reward top performers with managerial positions. Instead, the managerial ladder should be reserved for those who enjoy coaching; the expert ladder for those who like mastering technical skills; and the customer ladder for people who love working with clients and care about their satisfaction. The key message in this book: The ability of workers to perform has everything to do with their reasons for working. Effective leaders need to help employees excel by showing them the pleasure, purpose and potential of their work.  Actionable advice: Avoid the reward and punishment approach to motivation.  To decrease the cobra population of Delhi in the 1800s, the government said it would pay a bounty for dead cobras. The policy, however, led to the creation of cobra farms, where people would raise snakes then kill them, to collect the bounty! When the government caught on, the farmers released the snakes en masse, flooding the land with cobras – and making the initial problem even worse. This story illustrates why as a leader, you should avoid the reward and punishment approach to motivation.

Have you asked yourself how to push your team or wondered whether performance reviews really lead to better work? Profit from the Positive provides a complete system that will help you become a better leader and improve your team’s performance. You’ll learn how to get more work done without working more hours, how to control your emotions and improve a bad mood, how to avoid making hiring mistakes, and more. The best part? You don’t have to be an expert, have a budget, or get your boss’ permission. Anyone can use these tools, whether you manage four or 40,000 people. In addition, you’ll learn how putting a pen in your mouth can make you happier; why a bad mood can be as infectious as a cold; and why asking someone to rate their own weirdness can save you lots of money. If you’re a manager, you’re probably always on the lookout for new ways to increase both your own and your employees’ productivity. Let’s take a look at a few simple tricks for achieving that. First of all, always take the time to formulate a plan before leaping into action. The importance of this can be seen in a study by psychologist Peter Gollwitz, where he told his students to write a report on how they spent Christmas, and hand it in on 27 December. While half the students just got the assignment, the other half were also asked to identify exactly when and where they would complete it. It turned out that this “plan” made a huge difference: 71 percent of the second group submitted their reports on time, compared to just 32 percent who’d made no concrete commitment to getting it done. This insight is easy to apply in other areas too. For example, saying, “Could you bring that report to the conference room after the 10 a.m. meeting?” is more effective than, “Could you hand it in tomorrow?” because the former creates a specific plan for the other person to follow. Another way to improve productivity is tricking yourself into getting started. Let’s say you’ve got a long, daunting to-do list and you’re having trouble getting started. Just pretend you’ve already begun! Jot down a few additional tasks that you’ve already completed, and then cross them out. This simple act will make you feel like you’ve already done something, which will motivate you to continue. Finally, if you really want to be more productive, create positive habits and routines. Consider Deborah. She used to check her email all the time, interrupting her other work. To improve her productivity, she decided to adopt a new positive habit: checking her emails only four times a day, at specific times, and not just whenever a new email arrived in her inbox. This allows her to better focus on her work, saving her time in the long run. To be a true leader, it isn’t enough to be productive – you also have to be resilient. Because the truth is, we all experience setbacks and disappointments. What matters most is how quickly we bounce back. So don’t quit just because something went wrong in the past. Rather, be grateful for these mistakes and learn from them. Use these experiences to help you confront current challenges. If your company loses a client, ask yourself: How did that happen? How can we avoid making the same mistakes with our new client? Once you’ve asked these questions about the past, move forward by putting your focus on the present and future. What do you hope to learn from this new project? What mistakes might you make? How can you avoid them? Finding the cause of the failure will help you learn from the experience. One excellent technique for analyzing what went wrong and preparing for new projects is called the Me-Always-Everything Framework. In this framework, you analyze failure from three different perspectives: \nMe: Ask, did I cause this failure? Or did external events cause it? Was it a combination of both? \nAlways: Does this situation always happen to me? Or is this a one-off setback? \nEverything: Will this event spill over into other domains in my life? Or is this an isolated situation? Another key to resilience is to change your perspective on a bad situation. If you’re feeling negative, shifting your perspective to a more positive mind-set may spur you to action. For example, consider the severity perspective: How bad is this compared to other situations you’ve already faced? Remembering bad situations you’ve mastered will allow you to draw strength from them. You might also consider the extremes perspective: What’s the worst thing that could happen? What’s the best? And then, finally, what is the most likely to happen? Thinking about these aspects will help you see things in a more positive light. After all, to err is human. Simply learn from your mistakes and move on! We don’t always realize it, but our moods have a powerful effect on everyone around us. That’s because emotions are catching, as explained by social contagion theory. Basically we humans are hardwired to mimic each other’s facial expressions and moods. According to the theory, just one person in any team of five can “infect” the other four. So when you’re in a bad mood at work, it spreads like a cold, which can seriously damage productivity. On the other hand, positive feelings are equally contagious. Studies show that when bank tellers are in a good mood, they produce greater customer satisfaction by passing on their upbeat emotions. This phenomenon also has a status component. People higher up in the organizational hierarchy are more contagious, meaning that an office leader’s positive or negative mood can spread to others in the team in as little as seven minutes, quickly impacting everyone’s performance. This was demonstrated in a study of 53 sales managers: When leaders were in a good mood, their teams performed better, generating higher sales. So although it’s extremely important for leaders to stay positive, we all get the blues from time to time – that’s natural. But it’s important to overcome your bad moods. Let’s look at four different techniques you can try. These techniques can help you infect your staff with only good moods! Now that you embody productive, resilient and contagious leadership, there’s another attribute you need to master. You need to become a strength-based leader – someone who focuses on strength, not weakness. So for instance, when analyzing your business, ask questions about what your company is doing right: Where is this change or process being implemented well? What can we learn here that could apply to other areas? What makes this employee or competitor successful? Why does this team or location constantly exceed expectations? This approach allows you to focus on solutions, not faults. It’s also a fantastic way to handle challenges your business may be facing. For example, when you’re facing an obstacle, say: “Let’s brainstorm solutions. What are some short-term possibilities? Long-term ones?” This will help everyone focus on solving the problem. Of course, managing a team is stressful. Some managers, in an effort to avoid having problems dumped on their desks, tell employees, “Don’t bring problems if you can’t propose a solution.” But this is flawed logic. If employees aren’t communicating with you about serious problems, you might learn about them too late. Another important aspect of strength-based leadership is that you and everyone on your team actually have to know their own strengths. Research bears this out: A sales team was asked to complete a 40-minute strength assessment followed by a one-on-one discussion of the results. Another sales team didn’t. The team that completed the assessment later generated 17 percent more sales than the other, showing that focusing on strength really lifts performance. So how can you uncover your own strengths? Just ask yourself three questions: What am I good at? What kind of work energizes me? When am I at my best? Ultimately, being a strength-based leader doesn’t mean ignoring problems, just focusing on solutions. Every organization needs new people every now and then. The trouble is, how do you find the right people? This question is a serious one because hiring mistakes are expensive: factoring in everything, each mistake costs a company around five times the hire’s salary! So how can you ensure you make the right hires? Perhaps the most important tool you have at your disposal is the interview, so you need to prepare it well. Don’t make the typical mistake of talking too much. Let them do the talking so you also get a feel for the candidate’s personal skills. They are often more important than technical ones. For example, if you’re looking for a customer service person, it’s better to hire someone with a positive attitude and no experience, than someone with a lot of experience but a bad attitude. After all, you can always teach someone new skills, but it’s much harder to change their attitude. In the same vein, it’s important to only hire people who fit your company’s culture. Google developed a term for inspiring employees: Googly. A Googly employee is a smart, creative, a good problem solver and fun. You, too, need to figure out what kind of employee profile would fit your own company. Of course, to be able to do this, you have to first understand your company’s culture, starting with your organization’s core values. Only then can you tailor your interview to find suitable people. Let’s look at Zappos, which celebrates individuality among its employees. When interviewing job applicants, the CEO always asks: “On a scale from one to ten, how weird on you?” This question helps identify employees who would enjoy the individualistic company culture. This leads to higher employee loyalty and less staff turnover. Finally, give the hiring process enough time: the typical one-hour interview may not cut it. For example, at Rackspace, prospective employees stay at the office for nine or ten hours. That way they truly get to know the company – and vice versa. Here’s something you may find surprising: Focusing on what people do well, rather than their weaknesses, will boost productivity. This means once you’ve assessed your own strengths, you should start focusing on what your employees do best. This was demonstrated in a study that tried to pinpoint aspects of effective leadership. One of the metrics was the intensity of leaders’ focus on their employees’ strengths, and researchers found that managers who scored in the top quartile for this metric achieved 50 percent better project performance than managers who paid less attention. Connecting with your employees about their strengths doesn’t have to be a big event. Make helping them tap into their skills part of your everyday interaction. These conversations don’t have to happen solely on a one-on-one basis, either. When personal strengths are part of daily conversations and team meetings, employees will get to know their colleagues’ core abilities. This will create an environment in which differences are understood and valued, because they’re seen as contributions to the overall power of the team. This helps avoid conflict. To start creating this kind of atmosphere, host a workshop where you go around the room and ask team members to share one or two of their strengths and discuss how they’ve used them recently. And once everybody knows each other’s strengths and weakness, you can collaboratively plan how to position the team for success on upcoming projects, leveraging the sum of those strengths. By identifying and cultivating your employees’ key skills, what you’re really doing is getting people to perform their best. Performance reviews can be an uncomfortable experience for managers and employees alike. But they don’t have to be. Instead of going into a performance review to evaluate your employee, see it as a time to re-energize them. Start by using the language of strength. For example, say something like: “Ann, you’re an exemplar of the achiever strength. You’re focused, hardworking and always deliver. I’d like you to keep using your learner strength to learn new processes.” Also, make sure you don’t set vague goals. When you tell employees, “Just do your best,” they’re more likely to slack off, since they don’t know how to improve. Instead, try something like: “You’re an emotional person. I like that side of you. Please write down your worries and feelings about this new project and send them to me by 2 p.m.” These kinds of specific goals will help you connect with your employees, but to really motivate people, it’s important to also set challenging goals. For proof, just ask Gary Latham, who researches goals at the University of Toronto. In multiple studies of different occupations, Latham found that those who set challenging and specific goals performed better than those who didn’t. That’s because when you accomplish a goal, you feel pride. “Challenging goals facilitate pride in accomplishment,” explains Latham. And to make the most of the goals you set, review them more than once a year. That way, you’re motivating your employees again and again. Finally, go beyond the conventional performance review and make it a preview. Ask your employees to preview their performance for the year ahead. Have them imagine you’re meeting a year from now to discuss their work. Ask them to visualize what a successful year would look like and what they have specifically done to achieve their goals. Then, make the conversation especially memorable by asking your employees to write down their preview. So while performance reviews may get a bad rep, they’re actually a great chance to push your team. Imagine a world in which your employees actually look forward to meetings. It might sound impossible, but you can make it happen. How? First of all, pay special attention to openers and closers. The way you start and end meetings matters because it’s unrealistic to assume that everyone has arrived in a good mood and ready to focus. Consider this: a staggering 91 percent of surveyed respondents admitted to daydreaming during meetings. You don’t have control over anyone’s mind-set, but kicking off with a positive opener will boost the overall mood. To do this, recognize an accomplishment, acknowledge a specific success or tell a funny story. Another way to improve moods at the start of a meeting is by offering a small gift. For example, in one study, two sets of doctors were asked to make a complex diagnosis for a patient. One group was asked to first read the medical profession’s ethical code. The other group received a piece of candy instead. The sweets helped: The second group of doctors were three times as accurate as the first. And once you’ve nailed the beginning, don’t neglect the ending, because people always remember the last few minutes of a meeting. Take time to discuss next steps and end things on a positive note. Another key to running a productive meeting is ensuring everyone has a chance to contribute. Of course, managing the conversation is challenging for any meeting facilitator. To get people to speak up or to stop talking, try this: Before the meeting, draw a circle on a sheet of paper. Label the circle with each participant’s name. As each person contributes, put a checkmark next to their name so you can follow who participates and who doesn’t. If you notice someone interrupting, step in. Acknowledge the point and move on by asking for another perspective. Tell your team you don’t need superstars – you want everyone to participate. Follow these steps and your employees might actually look forward to meetings. By now you’ve read about quite a few tools and ideas for effective leadership. But how can you actually apply them to the real world? First of all, start small. You don’t need anyone’s permission to use these tools; you don’t need your boss or the HR department to get on board. Just pick three techniques you can start doing today and go for it! For example, why not start today’s meeting with a piece of cake and a compliment? Another key to implementing these tools successfully: Use language everybody understands. Avoid jargon – it’ll make people lose interest in your suggestions or think you’re arrogant, and either way, they’ll just ignore you. Remember Gollwitz’s study, which described how specific plans help us achieve goals? Well, never refer to it by that name because no one’s going to know what that means. Instead, coach your employees in layman’s terms: tell them they can achieve their goals by identifying where and when they’ll complete certain tasks. Here’s something else you might remember: Social contagion theory, which explains how emotions circulate. You don’t need to use the term in order to benefit from the insight. Pay attention to the mood you project when you walk into work. If it’s not positive, change it. Finally, a crucial point for anyone who wants to apply what we’ve learned to the real world: Don’t resist resistance. When we try to introduce something new – whether at work or at home – our ideas are often met with resistance. That’s totally natural. If you can expect resistance then you won’t be surprised by it. Instead, you can view it as a promising sign of change. When people in our lives resist our ideas, it typically means that they have their own pain points that need to be addressed. So give them some time to rethink their attitude. That’s it! Now you’re prepared. So make a brief plan and trick yourself into getting started. Good luck! The key message in this book: Productive leaders create positive habits, like checking emails only at specified times, and always make plans before starting projects. They’re also good at controlling their emotions as well as focusing on solutions and strengths, rather than problems. And even when things go wrong, productive leaders are resilient and learn from their mistakes. Actionable advice: Feeling grumpy and irritable? Try the pen smile. Simply hold a pen gently between your teeth for a couple of minutes. Why will that work? Well, the pose is similar to the position our mouths are in when we’re smiling. Holding the pen activates our smiling muscles, inducing the brain to think “Oh, this is funny.” This simple physical act produces a feeling of happiness, which consequently mitigates our bad mood and makes us more productive. This easy trick can help ease your negative mood, putting you in a more positive mental state. Suggested further reading: How to Be a Positive Leader by Jane E.

Some see the sensitive and quiet type as their ideal boss, and others hold the drill-sergeant in high esteem. But in these blinks, the case is made for the radically candid boss – the boss who can be both caring and direct and combine bluntness with empathy. You’ll find out why radical candor is something you need in your workplace, how to practice it on a day-to-day basis, and how it’ll help you handle the inevitable challenges of leadership. You’ll also learn why a fear of hurting people can create the most suffering; when and why it’s OK to fire someone; and how ten minutes of silent listening can benefit your leadership skills. Are you the kind of manager who arrives at the office feeling joyful and excited about the opportunity to shepherd your team through another great day of work? This may not be an accurate description of your current routine, but it’s a good example of how things could be once you start using radical candor. At the heart of radical candor are two principles: a manager should personally care about their employees and challenge them in their work. While it’s true that there are no simple solutions guaranteed to work for everyone, these principles are a great way of developing trusting relationships in the workplace. And even though different people have unique personalities and reactions, radical candor can help any manager improve their relationship with just about any employee. So, the first step is to become more than just a coworker by establishing personal relationships that prove you genuinely care. This means opening up, sharing and talking about more than just business. Contrary to what some may think, a good working relationship is a highly personal one. However, a good manager must also be willing to challenge their employees when they’re not meeting expectations. This can be difficult for managers. Being candid and direct doesn’t always feel like friendly and caring behavior. But as we’ll explore further, challenging your staff to be their best is indeed the hallmark of a boss who truly cares. We’ll also look at the many benefits radical candor has for performance and office culture. By being honest and direct with your employees, you’ll find that new lines of communication readily open up. Staff will be quick and willing to accept your feedback, and they’ll feel free to offer feedback regarding your work as team leader. This attitude will spread throughout your workforce. When you’re radically candid with your staff, they’ll soon become radically candid among themselves, which makes for a healthy, productive and efficient work environment. So, now that you know the basic principles let’s dive in and have a closer look. If you have experience as a manager, then chances are you know what it’s like to have someone react aggressively or defensively to constructive feedback. Even when your intentions are positive, there’s a delicate skill to providing guidance and criticism while coming across as helpful, rather than mean. And this is exactly what radical candor can achieve. When the author, Kim Scott, was first starting out as a manager for Google, she had a boss who was brilliant at delivering feedback with radical candor. Once, after Scott delivered a successful presentation, her boss took her aside to give her some constructive criticism. But her boss didn’t just blurt it out; she began by honestly complimenting Scott’s performance and the way she handled the questions from the audience. Only then did she bring up the criticism, which was about Scott’s habit of saying “um . . . ” too often. At first, Scott didn’t think this was too important – after all, the presentation went well. But then her boss elaborated: When someone says “um” too often, they can sound dumb, which would be a shame, especially when they’re as smart as Scott. This kind of comment is radical candor at its best. She made her point clear while managing to compliment Scott at the same time, and the author was soon working with a speech coach to become even better at her job. This example shows us how radical candor gets results by being open, honest and direct. First of all, Scott’s boss didn’t let the overall success of the presentation discourage her from pointing out how it could have been even better. And she didn’t wait to provide feedback, either, which allowed Scott to immediately improve her performance. Perhaps most importantly, her boss was honest and direct about both the positive and negative aspects of the work, and she didn’t sugar coat anything. This ensured that Scott got the point and didn’t mistake it for a personal attack. Anyone who’s seen the movie The Devil Wears Prada has seen a good example of a toxic workplace. The film features a terrifying and abusive boss played by Meryl Streep and based on Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue magazine. This depiction of leadership is quite the opposite of radical candor; being honest and direct does not give you the right to be obnoxiously aggressive. Remember, radical candor is about expressing care for your staff, as well as being open and direct. Ultimately, when a boss humiliates an employee with their criticism, they create enemies, destroy morale and cause people to quit their job. However, if you have to choose between being an unpopular asshole who tells it like it is or being a friendly boss who can’t be critical of your staff, choose being unpopular. In the long run, it will be better for business and everyone involved if you are clear and honest. But, of course, radical candor is the best of all options. Other behavior traits that a successful boss should avoid are manipulative insincerity and ruinous empathy. Manipulative insincerity is another result of not caring and not challenging your employees to help them grow as professionals; it often stems from the manager being lazy. For example, if an employee gives a poor presentation, a manager with manipulative insincerity may respond by saying it was adequate. They’ll do this because it’s easier than getting into a discussion about what needs to be improved. A manager with ruinous empathy, on the other hand, will avoid conflict not out of laziness, but rather out of a misplaced fear of hurting an employee’s feelings. Yet the result of ruinous empathy is that the employee will only suffer more due to a lack of improvement. When a boss refuses to be critical of an employee whose performance is deteriorating, that employee will only grow more incompetent until the manager is forced to fire them. So if you truly care about an employee, being honest is always in their best interest. In a perfect world, everyone would have a fulfilling job for which they have genuine passion. But in reality, some jobs are tedious, and it isn’t the manager’s role to make them appear otherwise. Being radically candid means that you’re honest and don’t sugarcoat things to motivate your employees. Having a job with meaning and a noble purpose can inspire employees to perform to their best ability, but it’s not up to you to manufacture that meaning and purpose when they’re not there. Doing so can backfire and make matters worse. When the author was a manager in Google’s customer support department, she tried to manufacture meaning and convince her staff that their work was of vital importance to Google’s creative workers. But at least one employee saw right through her phony pep talk. And he was absolutely correct when he told her that it would be better to tell the truth and admit that a lot of necessary jobs can be tedious and unfulfilling. There’s no use dodging the fact that some jobs have only one reward: earning enough money to pay the bills and live comfortably. So be honest with your employees and tell them that there is still satisfaction to be had in doing a job well, and make sure that good work is acknowledged. There’s no need to feel you must solve your employees’ existential dilemmas. However, you can provide them with perspective on their careers and the tools to help them grow and develop as professionals. To do this honestly, you’ll need to spot the difference between a superstar and a rockstar. Superstar employees need to be challenged and permitted to grow quickly so they can move up the corporate ladder and reach their full potential. Rockstar employees offer a steadier presence, and they will be great as long as they’re given the stability and time to excel at the job they’re given. Up next, we’ll look at a different employee, the falling star. If you’ve been fired, there’s a good chance you felt some animosity toward your ex-boss. This is a natural reaction, but it can blind us to the fact that this likely wasn’t the outcome that the boss wanted, either. Any manager will tell you that firing people is one of the hardest parts of the job. Firing someone is tough because you’re making someone else’s life incredibly difficult, even if it’s only temporarily. And in many cases, it’s not only the employee who’s suffering but their spouse and children too. Not only are you taking away a source of money, but entire families can lose health insurance, and the whole incident can cause all sorts of marital strife. This is why a manager needs to ensure someone is fired for the right reason. It’s also important to remember that other employees are aware when someone is let go, so the incident should still reflect you as being an honest and caring boss. For this to happen, you need to consider three main points before a firing takes place. First of all, every effort should be made to help the employee improve their performance. This shows that you care and that firing is your last resort. As always, you should use radical candor to support their good work and be honest and direct in how they can improve, while avoiding any personal attacks. Second, you need to consider the effect a bad employee has on the overall team. If the person is an annoying and demoralizing presence, then it makes sense to let them go. The third aspect to consider is an outside opinion. If you have any doubts, it’s good to bring in an impartial third party and get their opinion on the matter. When all of this is taken into consideration, you should have a clear understanding of what needs to be done. No one wants to be involved in a firing, but there’s also a good chance that the departing employee needs to find a job that better suits his skills. There’s a good way and a bad way to approach team leadership. The bad approach is to think of it as an opportunity to boss people around. The right approach is to see your team as a great opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals. Nevertheless, many managers mistakenly believe their job is to tell people what to do, which will only lead to problems since leaders make mistakes. Steve Jobs knew he could be wrong, so he relied on his team to speak up and challenge him when they disagreed with his ideas. On at least one occasion, Jobs was furious when an employee gave up and let him win an argument because it later turned out the employee was right. Jobs had to remind the employee that he was hired to ensure Jobs didn’t make these kinds of mistakes, and not back down from a fight. So, how do you lead a team without giving orders? It might sound like a paradox, but the answer is collaborative leadership, and there is an art to practicing it. The first step is to really listen to what the people in your team have to say. When you do this, your team will feel safe to speak their minds and have the kind of discussions that lead to brilliant ideas. The second step is to give your team the time and space to develop their ideas. Otherwise, they can end up being shot down before they ever have a chance to be clearly understood. The third step is to allow for healthy debate so that the best ideas are presented and agreed upon. The final step is for you, the manager, to persuade other company executives that your team’s idea is worth pushing forward. Then it’s up to you to execute the idea and make sure everyone gains valuable insight from the results. This process gets repeated over and over again. There are a lot of tutorials on how a boss should speak, yet knowing how to listen is just as important. The first thing you should know is there are two ways of listening, and you should practice the one that suits your personality. On the one hand, there is quiet listening, which suits leaders who prefer to let others do the talking. Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is one such leader. He’s notorious for using painfully long stretches of silence to get others talking. If you’re practicing quiet listening, you should spend at least ten minutes of an hour-long conversation patiently listening to what the other person has to say. This is especially useful for people who want honest opinions. Too often, managers will interrupt people and share their own opinions. As a result, those who are talking will change their message to match the manager’s opinion. So, for quiet listening to work, you must provide the encouragement and freedom for your team to feel comfortable saying what’s truly on their mind. Only then can you settle in for a good, quiet listen. Loud listening, on the other hand, is good for leaders with a more confrontational personality. This was how Steve Jobs listened. He would make a strong statement and insist that others provide an equally strong response to keep the discussion going. Since loud listening pushes people into talking, it is an effective way to draw shy employees out of their shells. However, you will need to instill confidence in your teammates if you want them to speak up. For this to happen, you’ll need to respond positively to their opinions, even if you don’t agree with them, so that they’ll continue to speak up and challenge your ideas. Listening to your employees is key to promoting an effective and creative team. And as we’ll see in the final blink, it also puts you in a position to help move their careers forward. While there’s nothing wrong with working a job just to pay the bills, you’re bound to have people in your team who have big dreams they’re hoping to realize. Managers should support the dreams of their staff and help them approach those dreams in a realistic fashion. To do this, you must first talk (and listen) to your employees so that you understand their aspirations, and they know that you are personally invested in helping them get on the right path. When Russ Laraway was the director of sales at Google, he used career talks as a way to help keep his team motivated. One of his employees was Sarah, and when he asked about her aspirations, she initially responded with some hesitation and said she hoped to one day be a boss, like Russ. But Russ sensed that Sarah wasn’t being completely honest with him, so he asked her if she had any other visions for her future. Sure enough, Sarah described her dream of owning a farm that grew spirulina, an algae-like super food. Russ was now able to talk to Sarah about her upbringing and identify her main motivators, such as helping the environment, working hard, and being a financially independent leader. With this in mind, they could now focus on developing Sarah’s management skills rather than her analytical skills to make sure her current job was preparing her for running that spirulina farm. To understand your employees’ dreams and identify those important motivators, use one of three kinds of conversations. The first is the life story conversation where the employee tells you everything leading up to the present day, and you try to find their motivating factors. The second is the dream job conversation, where they describe their biggest career desire. The third is the 18-month plan conversation, where they look into the immediate future, and you identify everything that can be done to keep them on the right track. By following these guidelines, it won’t be long before you have a team of highly motivated individuals working together and achieving great things. The key message in this book: By using radical candor, you can become the best possible boss. Radical candor helps you listen and express genuine care for your employees. It also allows you to directly challenge your staff members in a constructive way to which they’ll be receptive. This makes leadership a collaborative and personal process that brings out the best in everyone. Actionable advice: Have a growth plan for your employees.  Don’t just think of your staff as people who are only there to do what you assign them to do. Think of them as individuals on a career path and work with them to develop a plan that keeps that career on track. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

If you start small, you need far less time and resources than you imagine. First, test the waters: don’t quit your day job to slave 100-hour weeks, but rather gauge your enthusiasm by squeezing in a few hours each week to work on your idea. You don’t need to take on crippling amounts of debt either; just use whatever facilities and equipment you have at your disposal or can easily afford. Only use external investment as a last resort, as it will not only dilute your stake in the idea but the process of looking for funding is time-consuming and distracting. In most cases, all you need is a laptop and an idea to get started; everything else is peripheral to your success anyway. When starting your company, focus all your efforts on building the core of your business. Without this core, your business cannot function. For example, hotdogs are the core of a hotdog cart operation. The core should be something you think will be stable in time. Amazon’s core isn’t only about books; it’s about fast shipping, affordable prices and a great selection. Publishing fads come and go, but these are things people will always be willing to pay for. Once your core is ready, launch immediately. Don’t wait for every aspect of the business to be fully complete. You can work out the details later. When 37signals launched its Basecamp product, they could not even bill customers yet. But with the monthly billing cycle, they knew they had four weeks to fix the issue. Just get started and wing it. You need less than you think to start your own company – launch as soon as the core of your business is ready. The only way you can attain the sense of urgency and devotion that running a successful company requires is by doing something that matters to you. If you’re going to do something, make it something you can be proud of. Some people start their business with an exit in mind from day one. This is the equivalent of entering a relationship with the aim of breaking up – absurd. Just like a relationship, running a business should be based on commitment and passion rather than the willingness to sell out at any moment. Making a stand for something that is important to you is also a great way to attract loyal followers and fans. Consider Vinnie’s Sub Shop in Chicago: they stop selling sandwiches in the afternoon because the bread is no longer as fresh as it was in the morning. The extra income they could earn in the afternoon would not make up for the loss of pride they would suffer from selling mediocre sandwiches. Their customers love this devotion to freshness. Once you have a stand, a great way to emphasize it is to pick a fight with an existing competitor. If you run a small coffee house that you see as a haven for individualists, position yourself as the anti-Starbucks. Having an enemy will provide you with instant positioning in the customer’s mind and a great story to tell. Do not, however, let your competitors dictate your own strategy. If your immediate goal is to copy the iPhone 5 or to come up with a response to it, you are doomed to always be one step behind your competition. Focus on what you’re doing, not on what others have done. Make a stand for something you care about. If your company is successful, others will try to copy it. Your only defense is to make your product inimitable by injecting it with what is unique about you. For example, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh is so obsessed with customer service that he decided to make it the guiding ethos of his company. While competing shoe stores can sell the same sneakers as Zappos, they cannot imitate this utter devotion to good customer service. A great way to find your passion is to make a product or service that you yourself would love to use. For example, when track coach Bill Bowerman wanted lighter running shoes for his team, he poured rubber into his family’s waffle iron, inventing the famous Nike waffle sole. Usually, people expect great things from products they buy but are disappointed at the actual performance delivered. Your product should be the opposite: make it so simple and easy-to-use that people will love it even more than they expected and tell their friends about it, too. If you accomplish this, you can sell your product like a drug dealer: give people a taste for free, knowing they will happily come back for more. Once you have a product that is unique and keeps customers coming back, you can share everything you know without giving away any secrets that would create imitators. Just as great chefs can promote themselves by publishing cookbooks with their prized recipes, you too can promote your company by sharing your valuable experiences and specialized knowledge openly. Better yet, teach people with how-to guides, courses and videos! Most companies – especially big ones – are so secretive that you can gain a real competitive advantage by actively teaching people about things you’ve learned. Make your product inimitable so that you can share everything you know. Many small start-ups long for mass and greater recognition, but bigger is not always better. Consider elite schools like Harvard and Cambridge. Do you think they aim to expand their campuses all over the world, educating hundreds of thousands of people annually? Unlikely. Instead, they are comfortable being the size they are, as should you. For example, having less mass and being off the media radar allows you to experiment with your business without potential screw-ups being publicized. Just like Broadway musicals are first tested in smaller cities before reaching New York, you too should take advantage of your obscurity in the beginning to experiment with different ideas and processes. Being small also allows you to keep your entire team on the frontline of the business, interacting with customers firsthand and hearing their requirements and feedback. A complex hierarchy can muffle that feedback and slow you down. When everyone is responsible for customer satisfaction, you can respond to any problems quickly, which is essential for effective customer service. Nevertheless, being small to begin with does not mean you should forget that you’re running a business. Many start-ups live in a make-believe land where they happily spend investors’ money without worrying about profitability. Such companies are not really businesses but merely glorified hobbies of their founders. If you want to build a successful business, you should have a clear path to profitability in mind from the very start. Relish the good sides of being small, but don’t forget you are running a business. When chef Gordon Ramsay fixes ailing restaurants in his TV show, Kitchen Nightmares, he always starts the process the same way: by cutting out around two thirds of the menu items. Similarly, when you run into problems with your product, consider cutting features from it. If you want to make something great, you need to chisel away stuff that is merely good. In fact, embrace your constraints. Just like Ernest Hemingway wrote Nobel-winning fiction with very sparse language, you too can make a great product or service with very few features. If your competition offers a product with lots of features, don’t try to one-up them by offering everything they do plus more. Instead, offer less features, making your product simpler and easier to use. Add value by deciding what not to sell. Think about it: great art galleries don’t display every painting in the world but rather a select few. You too must cut out the garbage and personally vouch for whatever is left. Keeping your product or service simple is not easy, though. As you gain more and more customers, you’ll start getting more and more requests to develop the product further, both from users and from within your own team. Never overreact to these requests by immediately modifying your product and adding new features as requested. If you do, your product will rapidly become unrecognizable, and probably scare away new customers since the changes have been catered to the wishes of existing ones. Say no to even the best-sounding ideas at first. If a customer request is truly important, it will keep coming up so often that you can’t ignore it. Less is more – start saying no and keep your product lean. There’s nothing wrong with having communications that reflect the true size of your company. Be proud that your small size lets you communicate frankly, contrary to the meaningless jargon-filled press releases of big corporations. For example, don’t talk about how “transparency is a corner stone of your communications strategy,” when you could just say you’re honest. Advertising and active marketing are expensive ways to connect with customers. Instead, build an audience by sharing information that they value and willingly come back for. This way you will get their attention without paying a dime. Remember that in a small organization, marketing is everyone’s responsibility. Every email, phone call, blog post and social media update constitutes marketing and can deepen your bond with customers. In fact, why not give customers a behind-the-scenes view of your company, so they can get to know you and your employees. When you do strive for actual press coverage, go for niche rather than mass media. An article in a well-targeted small magazine or blog will create much more website traffic and sales than a story in a well-known newspaper. This also allows you to approach journalists with personalized calls or notes rather than with mass press releases. The bond you form with customers will inevitably endure some rough weather as well, and being a straightforward communicator means being frank about your shortcomings and imperfections too. No one likes companies that try to sweep problems under the rug. If there’s bad news to be told, skip the pseudo-apologies in corporate lingo such as “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.” Instead, think about what kind of apology you would like to hear as a customer. Don’t emulate big corporations in your marketing and communications – be honest, personal and nimble. If you treat your team like children, they will act accordingly, and you will need to spend half your time managing them and making decisions on their behalf. Your team will quickly turn into non-thinkers and non-doers, and end up costing you a lot of time and effort while accomplishing very little. What you need are employees who can manage themselves, and such individuals only thrive in working environments where they are given trust, responsibility and autonomy. One defining characteristic of a good environment is directness in communication. Avoid abstractions and long-winded, high-level explanations. Get real, and show your team exactly what you mean. Don’t sit in meeting rooms discussing problems but go to the problem sites themselves to get a grip on what’s wrong. Criticism should be equally honest. If your team is too large and unfamiliar with each other, you will find that the discussion does not flow freely. You need frank, honest communication within your team so that bad ideas are criticized when they should be. Finally, there are certain words you should avoid when communicating within your team. Consider a situation where you’re facing a seemingly impossible task, and someone belittlingly says to you “We can’t survive without this; it should be easy for you to do.” It doesn’t exactly leave a lot of room for discussion, does it? Abrasive, value-laden words like need, must, only and can’t imply judgment about the realities of someone’s situation and can rapidly obliterate any hope of a fruitful discussion. Also, stop using the word “ASAP” entirely when asking someone for something. It suffers from inflation and merely makes other, non-ASAP requests seem less urgent. Create an environment where people manage themselves and communicate with each other honestly. As a small company, one of the key advantages you have over your larger competitors is your ability to make quick decisions without getting bogged down in bureaucracy. Start saying, “Let’s make a decision,” instead of, “Let’s think about it.” Don’t look for a perfect solution; get to good enough quickly and keep moving. Don’t over-analyze or over-plan. Unless you have a crystal ball, estimating and planning are basically guesswork anyway. If you start assuming your plans are correct and following them blindly, you lose your ability to improvise, which is downright dangerous. Instead, just wing it. Don’t make decisions far in advance but rather on the spot. Think about things that affect you this week, not next year. Small, reversible decisions that work for the time-being are much easier to make than big, life-changing ones where you have to worry about long-term consequences. Similarly, don’t make wide-ranging estimates like, “This one-year project will cost us about $1 million.” If you want to have any semblance of accuracy, chop your estimates into more manageable bits, like weeks rather than years. The impact of being wrong will also be far smaller this way. Finally, when you’re trying to make a decision, don’t be daunted by what might go wrong. There are always possible downsides to any decision but you can always deal with them when they actually happen. (Most never will.) Don’t over-plan – stay agile with quick and flexible decisions. Many people equate productivity with working long hours, when actually the opposite is true. The best employees have busy lives outside of work so they work hard to leave at five o’clock. Workaholics who stay late can even hurt the overall productivity of an organization by making non-workaholics feel guilty and less motivated. The way to maintain high productivity at work starts by stripping away interruptions that break people’s concentration. Ensure your team has some designated time during the day or week when there are no interruptions. The worst kind of interruption, of course, is a meeting. A one-hour meeting of ten people will in fact cost at least ten hours of aggregated working time. In some rare cases this may be warranted, but often meetings lack goals, agendas and any connection to actual work. In short, they only generate talk, not action. Another enemy of productivity is perfectionism. Getting bogged down in complex problems and trying to devise perfect solutions for them can consume weeks’ worth of effort, when in fact a quick fix would often be fine. To really be productive, go for solutions where you achieve the maximum effectiveness with minimal effort. “Good enough” is often better than “perfect.” One way to encourage this non-perfectionism is to chop large projects and tasks into small chunks and to-do lists. This not only makes complex endeavors more manageable but also provides more causes to celebrate along the way as minor milestones are reached. Such quick wins help sustain momentum and motivation. Productivity doesn’t follow from long hours, but rather from focused work and quick wins. Some companies are addicted to hiring people. They find someone great and decide to hire her, even without a specific job or title in mind. This is where trouble starts. When you hire someone, it should only be to solve an acute problem that is causing your company immense pain. Keeping your team lean for as long as possible will force you to adopt time-saving practices and an efficiency ethos, whereas hiring unnecessary people, no matter how great they are, will just lead to frustration and the creation of unimportant, artificial work to keep them busy. You might worry about missing out on “once-in-a-lifetime” hires, which might be a legitimate concern if your hiring pool is small. But if you are willing to hire employees from across the globe, you’ll always be able to find more great people. Almost anyone can work online these days, so the geographical location of your employees is basically irrelevant. When you do end up hiring someone, ignore the established recruitment doctrine of analyzing resumes, grade point averages and years of experience. Instead, trust your instincts and concentrate on what they have actually learned to do thanks to their past experience. Finally, test-drive your employees. No amount of interviewing will show you how a person will actually perform on the job, but giving them a mini-project to work on will let you judge them by their actions, rather than their words. BMW even went as far as to build a fake assembly line where recruiters could watch prospective employees in action. To better facilitate this on-the-job testing, always hire people to do jobs that you yourself have done at some point or another. This will also help you to manage them later on. Hire people only when absolutely necessary, and forget about resumes – trust your instincts. The key message in this book: Starting and running a company is far easier today than ever before. To build a successful business, you must inject your own uniqueness into your product and embrace the benefits of being small. Build a great working environment by emphasizing trust, independence and focus. The questions this book answered: How can you start your own business immediately? You need less than you think to start your own company – launch as soon as the core of your business is ready. Make a stand for something you care about. Make your product inimitable so that you can share everything you know. How can you use your small size to your advantage? Relish the good sides of being small, but don’t forget you are running a business. Less is more – start saying no and keep your product lean. Don’t emulate big corporations in your marketing and communications – be honest, personal and nimble. What is the new way of building and running a business? Create an environment where people manage themselves and communicate with each other honestly. Don’t over-plan – stay agile with quick and flexible decisions.

A worker behind every desk, typing away on a computer. Afternoon meetings in the conference room to discuss recent projects. Gossip at the water cooler; take-away lunch in a paper bag. Yet modern technology has completely changed the way we think of work. New ways of sharing information mean that sitting in an office from 9 to 5 is no longer necessary to get things done. More and more, company employees are working outside of a main office, and employers are also sharing in the benefits of this new type of working arrangement. But as more companies begin to offer more flexibility to their workers, both employees and managers have discovered that working remotely has its own complexities. Yet with the right attitude and a few simple ground rules, companies can benefit greatly from remote work. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: how office employees can spend just as much time browsing YouTube as working; why it’s a good idea to give employees the day off when the weather’s nice; and why a company only needs to meet with its remote employees twice a year. Recent technological developments have cut the strings of workers tied to their cubicles in an office, day in and day out. Employees can now choose remote work, or work done away from an office. Remote work is immensely popular with both employees and their employers. For employers, hiring remote workers gives them access to a larger talent pool, helping them to find the best person for a certain job. Even if you don’t live in a major metropolitan area, you can still access world-class talent if you consider hiring people who live elsewhere, allowing them to work from home. Technology has made it easier to work with someone on the other side of the world. For example, a basic (and free) Skype account allows you to videoconference with co-workers, regardless of where they are. But what about the employees you already have? Should they work remotely, too? Because people often switch jobs for personal reasons, offering your best employees the option to work remotely can help keep them on your team. Even workaholics have a life outside their job – the needs of family, friends or other interests outside work sometimes require an employee to move to a new location. Rather than simply firing workers who need to move, employers can instead offer the option to work remotely. After all, it’s better to hold on to a good, trained employee than to have to manage a new employee who needs extensive training and time to get up to speed. Media production company Jellyvision considered remote work options when a skilled employee needed to move with his spouse to another state. The company didn’t want to lose him, so they offered the employee a remote position, and since have opened up the option to all employees. Remote work isn’t just good for employers, but can also improve employees’ quality of life. Remote work offers an employee the flexibility to complete daily chores while still being productive. As workers can organize their time the way they want, they can make sure that they have time for work as well as for other things, such as housework or family  time. This sort of situation is perfect for employees who require a greater degree of flexibility in their day. For example, if you work in an office, your day is dictated by the office schedule, and cutting out for two hours to pick up your children requires permission, cancelling meetings, and whatnot. Yet if you worked remotely, you could easily stop what you’re doing and quickly take care of things. Moreover, not everyone works efficiently at the same time. Some people are energetic in the morning, while others prefer working in the late afternoon or even the evening. Unconstrained by traditional working hours, remote work allows you to work whenever you’re most productive. This is especially important for people involved in creative projects. It is almost impossible to force inspiration just because the “official” work day has begun! If you’re trying to develop a cure for cancer, you can’t guarantee that your muse will be ready to go exactly between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Finally, the flexibility of remote work means that you can start working toward your dream right away. Many people put their dreams on hold until retirement, as the daily grind – a long commute, time at the office  –  doesn’t allow enough time to pursue them. Yet with remote work, you can find more time without having to choose one or the other – your hobby or your career. For example, if your dream is to travel the world, you don’t have to wait – as long as you pack a laptop you can still work full-time and finance your next great adventure. Employers might be wary to introduce remote work as they might think that allowing employees to work outside the office would encourage them to be lazy. Think again! In fact, working in an office can be far less productive than working remotely. When you work in an office, you are surrounded by other people. Distractions are rife – a coffee break here, a little chat there, and soon enough half of your work day is already squandered. Additionally, much of your work is tied to the work of others. This can lead to you being peppered with and distracted by questions that probably could wait, but that your co-workers nonetheless harass you with, as you’re sitting right there –  and “it will only take a second!” Of course, if you work remotely from home or at a coffee shop there are bound to be interruptions and distractions as well. The difference is that you can better control such disruptions. You can ignore emails that aren’t urgent until you finish your own work; you’re protected from pestering co-workers; and you can tell your spouse that you’re unreachable until noon. In this way, remote work can allow you to better focus than you would if working in an office. In addition, remote work helps employers see through the noise of unimportant details of the work day to the true quality of an employee’s work. Many managers judge the value of an employee based on secondary factors, such as how often a worker takes breaks, how often he is late, or how nice they are to other colleagues, and so on. If an employee works remotely, an employer can evaluate that employee solely based on the actual quality of his work. Think about it: What does it matter if someone starts their work day half an hour later, if the work they submit on time is impeccable? We’ve seen the benefits that remote work can offer. But if working remotely is so great for both employees and employers, why do so many companies still resist it? One frequent argument against remote work is that having employees in many different places makes it more difficult to build a company culture. However, this perspective confuses “company culture” with “team building.” Company culture isn’t about ensuring that your workers have the same lifestyle and lunch hour; it’s about how your company’s values are reflected through your employees. Things like a positive attitude toward customer needs and long-term productivity goals are what counts in building a lasting company culture. Regular face-to-face meetings between colleagues aren’t necessary, however, to understand and implement that culture. Another reason that companies resist remote work is because they believe that innovation only happens when people collaborate face-to-face. Even if this is true, companies still struggle to implement ideas that have already been developed through such face-to-face meetings. If you can’t implement each day’s new idea, there’s no need for employees to meet every day! Furthermore, many managers think that a body in a chair in an office equals productivity. In other words, if you’re not at the office, you’re not being productive. However, a manager doesn’t have more control over an employee just because she’s sitting across the hall. If anything, a manager is simply fooling himself into thinking he has control. Consider this: Some 30 percent of the internet bandwidth at the headquarters for J.C. Penney is used to watch YouTube videos. Is that productive? Not in the least.   Many companies reject remote work offhand. These companies lazily contend that, while remote work might be fine for others, it just wouldn’t work for their organization. However, companies of all sizes from all industries have successfully introduced remote work, including some organizations you might think too traditional or too big to change – AT&T, Aetna, Intel and even the U.S. government! Simply saying no to remote work without giving it a chance is foolish. So now you’re convinced, and want to give remote work a try at your company. The following blinks deal with how to make this transition. Some companies believe that they are too invested in office work to make a successful shift to remote work. However, it doesn’t matter whether you manage employees at a start-up or at a multimillion-dollar established corporation: you can always introduce remote work into your normal work flow. “Going remote” simply means that your employees aren’t chained daily to their desks at the company office. It doesn’t mean, however, they can’t be there at all. Working remotely isn’t an all-or-nothing commitment. You might first test the waters by offering a few employees the opportunity to work remotely for a few days per week, for example. This way, you can see for yourself whether remote work is a good option for your company and can get an idea of what you’ll need to pay particular attention to, before allowing more employees to work remotely for a longer period of time. But whatever you do, don’t jump to make a decision. If you want to introduce remote work, don’t base your final judgment on one single employee who has worked at home for just one week. Instead, have an entire team work remotely for a few days a week over a couple of months to get a better sense of whether the concept works for everyone, you and your employees. Interestingly, you probably use remote work already without even thinking about it. It’s quite common for companies to outsource certain tasks to third parties, such as lawyers or accountants, advertising agencies, and so on. This is actually much riskier than allowing employees to work from home! As many companies already entrust work to professionals outside the company, it shouldn’t be so hard to imagine allowing your own employees to work outside company headquarters. Most work projects involve some sort of collaboration. Designers need to talk to web programmers, project managers reach out to clients. So how do you make sure employees are collaborating effectively while working remotely? One way or another, you’ll have to ensure that your teams can communicate with each other. These lines of communication don’t need to be open around the clock, but there must be at least some effective and consistent flow of information between remote workers and the home office. Make sure that your team members can work simultaneously – wherever they may be in the world  – at least some portion of the time, so members can discuss urgent matters together. At 37signals, the authors required a four-hour overlap between employees working on the same project. This way, each employee had a half-day to work however he or she wanted, but also had at least four hours to discuss topics of concern to the whole team. You can also make collaboration easier by making company information, aside from company secrets,  open and easily accessible online or in some shared space. One way that 37signals successfully does this is by creating a shared calendar, so that everyone knows who’s available and when. Importantly, you and your employees will have to be available for clients, who might be uneasy about dealing with remote workers. It’s understandable: building trust is just that much more difficult when a client can’t shake your hand or come visit an office to see your progress in person. You should then be upfront and clear about your remote working system from the start. Be sure to be very attentive to your clients and give them plenty of opportunities to contribute to projects wherever they may be in the world! This way, they’ll be able to see the fruits of their investment with their own eyes. Colleagues can turn into close friends or at least good acquaintances as people work together over time. But how does this work if employees never see each other in person? It’s a fact that no one can work 24/7 without having some sort of social interaction, and remote workers especially so. We all need to unwind from time to time, and it’s ideal when employees can do so with other colleagues to build and maintain a sense of team spirit. Of course, remote workers can just go for a walk if they’re feeling stressed. Nonetheless, it’s important for workers to get to know each other on a more personal level. To do this, 37signals created an online chat room for remote employees where they could spend breaks, just as an in-office team would in the coffee room or lunch room. Furthermore, remote workers and their employers need to be sensitive to how remote work can affect personal relationships. For instance, when you can’t see the other person’s smile or body language across the table, it’s easy to misinterpret just their words. From this, negative relationships can develop. Remote workers thus must be extra careful about the way they communicate with each other. Managers too must pay close attention to employees’ communications and encourage a friendly atmosphere. Finally, you have to recognize that technology simply isn’t a perfect substitute for real-life interactions. You’ll have to make sure there’s some socializing in the “real world,” too. While there are countless tools that make virtual collaboration possible, people still need to connect an online name with a face at some point. It doesn’t have to happen every day or even every month, but it does need to happen eventually to build trusting, loyal relationships. 37signals does this by inviting the entire company to meet twice a year, even when there is no particular project to discuss. By doing so, employees feel more connected, and the company as a whole is better united. Because of the flexibility inherent to remote work, the work day looks a lot different for remote workers. So remember to keep their needs in mind. For starters, remote workers run the risk of becoming lost in their work. While some people believe that these employees don’t do as much work as office employees, in fact, there is a real danger that remote workers actually do too much. Because they aren’t bound to normal office hours, remote workers might feel tempted to do a little extra here and there, and because of this, can eventually burn out. Be extra careful not to encourage this kind of behavior. After all, you can’t see burnout symptoms in front of you as you would if your employee was working in the office with you. To help avoid burnout, you might consider offering remote workers an extra day off between May and October, so that they can enjoy the weather and not be tempted to work too much. After all, you want your employees to be happy and productive; to ensure this, you don’t want them spending all day in their home office. Working out, meeting new people and other leisure activities might fall by the wayside if an employee lacks the social contacts that come with working in an office. Managers, therefore, have the responsibility to encourage remote employees to live a healthy and diverse lifestyle. For example, remote employees at 37signals receive help in paying for health club memberships as well as get extra money to buy fresh fruits and vegetables for healthier meals. Employees are also supported by the company in their pursuit of hobbies outside work, as company holiday gifts help bankroll travel, as one example. Finally, if remote workers aren’t a majority of your workforce, they can easily start feeling like  “second-class workers,” as they aren’t part of everyday office dynamics. Be sure to ask them what their needs are to make them feel included. Or, ideally, have a manager do some remote work as well to see how life feels in a remote worker’s shoes. The key message in this book: Modern technology means that employers and employees can easily benefit from remote work. However, the dynamics created by remote work are different than the normal office routine, so managers need to rethink how they manage remote workers to keep everybody happy and productive.

Maybe you make sure your educational background looks solid; maybe you make a strong personal statement. However, you probably place the most emphasis on showing how experienced you are. We believe that, while youthful passion will take us so far, employees are looking for, above all else, the know how of time spent on the job. And, to be fair, for a long time this was true, but not now. In the modern world, experience is no longer what we need. Instead, we need the drive, enthusiasm and flexibility found in rookies. These blinks show you how and why business of the future will be driven by the rookies. In these blinks, you’ll discover how after one world-breaking runner’s record led to several more; how we can become a perpetual rookie; and why one successful film director keeps reading the same book over and over again. Next time you’re faced with a stack of resumes, look beyond experience. The strongest candidates might be rookies, or someone without experience. Why? Because technology has changed the modern workplace in three distinctive ways that work in their favor. First, our knowledge about the world is increasing faster than ever. In fact, every year and a half or so, human knowledge doubles. Second, because of constantly improving research, new findings are rapidly proving old ones false. Therefore, mastery of old knowledge is becoming less and less relevant. Take for example, a 2005 study which showed that the annual knowledge relevance decay rate—or how much knowledge becomes irrelevant each year—is 15 percent overall and up to 30 percent for high tech knowledge. So if workers aren’t continuously learning, only about 15 percent of what they know may be up-to-date in five years. The final change is that technological advancements have expanded the workplace beyond the 9-to-5 day. Now, it’s standard practice to get an email from the boss at 9PM and be expected to respond. Due to these developments, experienced workers can struggle in this new environment. Many find it difficult to keep asking questions and learning when they’ve already accumulated a base of knowledge earlier in their careers. In addition, it’s harder for them to look for new solutions when they already have an old method that has worked in the past. On the other hand, rookies aren’t yet set in their ways, so they’re predisposed to deal well with change. They are willing and eager to learn and try new solutions. In the modern workplace, these traits are what translates into success. Because whether it’s day one on the job or day 1,000, the enemy of success is cutting ourselves off from new information and approaches. What makes rookies so valuable? Read on to find out how the rookie mindset leads to success and how everyone can have it. It’s a common way of thinking: if it worked in the past, it’ll work today. However, history has proven that the old ways aren’t always the best. So who can see new possibilities and improvements? Rookies can, because they aren’t bound by the status quo. Take, for example, runner Gunder Hägg. In 1945, Hägg beat the world record speed for running a mile, a record that had seemed unbreakable. A medical student named Roger Bannister disagreed. He developed his own unique training program to beat the record and did so in 1954. But then, only 46 days after Bannister broke Hägg’s record, someone else set an even faster one. Once people saw that breaking Hägg’s record was possible, the illusion of a limit was shattered and others were inspired to innovate as well. In contrast, rookies see and explore new solutions because they simply don’t know what is considered possible yet and aren’t fearful of tarnishing their reputation. Consider the story of Hara Kefalidou, a Greek politician who first entered politics with no experience, amidst a financial crisis. Government spending was being slashed across the Mediterranean country, and thanks to her rookie status, Kefalidou was able to offer a valuable suggestion. Unaccustomed to the status quo of living life as a Greek politician, she quickly pointed out unnecessary perks politicians enjoyed which were burdens on Greek taxpayers. For example, Greek legislators were paid extra when they attended committee meetings. To Kefalidou, attending these meetings was an important component of being a good legislator and not something deserving of a bonus, so she argued against them. She was a rookie, so she hadn’t gotten used to the old system and was consequently able to spot this cost-saving opportunity easily. After some convincing of the entrenched politicians, the additional pay was cut in half. It’s easy to assume that veterans know more than rookies simply due to their experience. However, that’s not always true. Why? Experienced workers tend to fall into the rut of opinion stasis, where they only seek out what confirms their own existing opinions and ignore everything else. Because of their background and confidence, they might actively put aside ideas which could prove their old ideas wrong–including new, better ways of working. Additionally, these blinders influence who they choose to associate with. Those with opinion stasis gravitate toward others with the same views. This makes them even less likely to get shaken out of complacency toward improved ideas and solutions because there are no differing notions around them. On the other hand, rookies actively seek out multiple opinions and ask for help. Rookies want to learn from a range of people and are more open to what they offer because they don’t have their own experience to fall back on. For example, a study showed that rookies reached out to experts 40 percent more often than experienced workers did. Additionally, rookies contacted six experts on average, while experienced workers only contacted one. Since they’re drawing information from so many different people and sources, the author estimates that rookies outshine experienced workers by five-to-25 times in terms of expertise. To that end, think of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel. Often considered his greatest achievement, it’s also the work of a rookie. Before painting the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo had focused on sculpture and had never painted a fresco. To overcome his lack of expertise, he hired assistants who were fresco experts to work shoulder to shoulder with him for weeks. He also consulted the papal court for ideas on content. Being a rookie pushed him to ask for help until he mastered the technique and could paint solo, bringing with him ideas from experts. Think of an experienced worker as a veteran marathon runner who moves at a slow, steady pace. There’s no reason to make a dash because she has run this before and already knows the pace needed to finish. In the workplace, this attitude translates into experienced workers having a hard time pushing themselves beyond their comfort zone because they’re so used to the current pace and attitude. This can be seen in the example of data processing company DATAPROF. The organization wanted a new headquarters that would improve its public image and passed the task onto Jack Peterson, an experienced facilities manager. After 12 months of work, Jack presented a potential project which worked from a financial and facilities point of view, but he failed completely at the task most important to the board: public image. His proposed construction looked identical to all the company’s other buildings. In contrast to experienced workers like Jack Peterson, rookies are eager to prove themselves, so they strive to overachieve. Because of their ambition, they reach and innovate. If rookies were running a marathon, they would sprint ahead and might well end up with a better time as a result. They’re unaware of their limitations, so they keep pushing. At DATAPROF, after Jack’s flop, the company brought in a rookie colleague to take on the project. The rookie made a slam dunk. How? Because he lacked facilities experience, he asked the employees who’d eventually work in the new building about their needs. And because he knew that public image was of utmost importance, he coordinated with the people who specialized in DATAPROF’s image, utilizing their expertise. Thanks to simply asking questions and considering new solutions, the rookie’s eventual proposal turned out to be perfect. There’s that saying: better the devil you know then the angel you don’t. Well, experienced workers tend to get stuck in this mindset: they get bogged down in protocol and how things were done in the past because it seems safer. Unfortunately, working within the confines of that safe zone limits their innovative potential. For example, a highly experienced New York-based sales manager received a promotion of greater responsibility, for a larger sales region. In the past, he had worked from an office in the city and relied on a narrow network of sales contacts. But when his region expanded, he failed to adapt accordingly. He needed more contacts and a new strategy to cover the larger area, but was too stuck in his ways to grow. Predictably, his performance plummeted. Unlike that experienced sales manager, rookies are always in a position in which they have to improvise and build something from nothing. They lack the knowledge, routine and network to do things in any set way. For example, at Stanford University, student Jane Cheng enrolled in a course with the goal of creating a baby incubator suited for the developing world. Jane and her team didn’t have a massive research team or a million dollar budget; they just had curiosity and ambition. So what did they do? They went out of their way to understand the countries to which they would provide incubators, learning about local issues like lack of electricity and how these countries couldn’t afford the traditional $20,000 incubators. The Stanford team developed an incubator that was, not only functional in a lab, but functional and realistic for the nations they were helping. They could provide incubators for just $25 which would serve the function of keeping an infant warm for four hours and could also be cleaned and recharged easily with boiling water. Happily, it’s not only recent graduates who can enjoy the rookie advantage. In the next blinks, you’ll learn how you can build a rookie mindset and reap the benefits, even when you are no longer a rookie. Despite what you might think, having the rookie advantage isn’t a matter of youth—rather, it’s all a matter of mindset. You can get the rookie advantage even if you’re a senior employee. There are perpetual rookies: people who are able to combine experience with rookie smarts. They achieve that practice by having hungry, curious minds, and always being willing to take on a challenge. They’re also humble enough to always allow others to teach them. A great example of someone who pushed himself to be a perpetual rookie is the 1970s world champion surfer Wayne “Rabbit” Bartholomew. Despite being one of the highest ranked surfers, he avoided the big waves other professionals sought out and preferred to surf at Huntington Beach, California. There, he was inspired and energized by the teenagers and other rookies who frequented the inferior waves. Another way to keep rookie smarts is to start fresh. Looking at your job and goals with fresh eyes is an easy way to start giving yourself the rookie advantage. Even if it’s a project you’ve tackled 100 times, imagine that this is the very first time you’ve done anything like it. The author learned this trick from business professor C.K. Prahalad. He regularly throws away notes he made from previous semesters, even if he’s teaching the same course, because he wants to share fresh thoughts. A final technique to adopt rookie smarts is to find inspiration among genuine rookies. Let their fresh ideas rattle your old ways of thinking. With these tools, you can take advantage of important rookie traits even if being a perpetual rookie doesn’t come naturally to you. Do you feel like you’ve lost the rookie mindset? Not to worry, thankfully there are ways to regain it. The first step to relearning rookie smarts is switching to learning mode, which is defined by a readiness to learn. Open yourself to new ideas; forget old notions of arrogance and routine; and use every source of inspiration available to you. This is a technique San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh used in preparing his players for a big game. While most of the team members were seasoned professionals, Jim saw the importance of their rookie enthusiasm and drive. He harnessed it by putting high school photos of each player above their locker to remind them of the learning attitude they had when they were young. It was that attitude that propelled them to the pros in the first place. One way to ease yourself into learning mode is to put yourself into a new, fresh situation. Try volunteering or swapping jobs for a day. By jumping into a new setting, it’s easier for your brain to switch over to learning mode, asking questions and enjoying the rookie advantage when you’re doing something new. You can also develop rituals and patterns that will help bring back your rookie mindset: trick your mind into stepping back in time to when you were a true rookie. Award-winning filmmaker Francois Truffaut had a rookie mindset ritual. Early in his career he went into a small bookstore and discovered a book about filmmaking which left a lasting impression on him. Even though he directed films for a quarter of a century afterwards, every year he would go back to the same shop and relive that defining moment by buying the same book and rereading it. How can rookie smarts help entire teams perform? Keep reading to see how great leaders harness rookie power. So how can you as a leader help harness the power of rookies in your organization? One way to do that is by remembering that rookies don’t just bring new ideas to the projects they’re working on, they can inspire whole teams. For instance, when Nike bought Converse in 2003, head of innovation Peter Hudson brought the brand back to the top of the industry by hiring new talent and entrusting older employees with bigger responsibilities, helping to instill a rookie mindset. Beyond coming up with just fresh clothing designs, the reborn team also suggested structural changes like working directly with factories. This made Converse much more agile and adaptable by shortening the process from design to finished product by several weeks. However, it’s important to remember that in order to make the most of rookies’ energy, leadership needs to point them in the right direction. Rookies need clear objectives to strive for. In addition, rookies need to be given enough responsibility and challenges so they can shine. These challenges should not be so big they can damage the organization, but not too small that they settle into minor roles and get bogged down in the status quo, ultimately losing their edge. When it comes to hospitals, experienced doctors often complain that resident doctors need to be reined in because they’re not adequately experienced to handle a dying patient on an operating table. However, such dire scenarios constitute only 5 percent of all circumstances, so actually, 95 percent of situations could be handled by the rookie residents. That’s lots of responsibility rookies can safely assume. So the next time a task needs dedication, creativity and enthusiasm, consider a rookie. He or she just might surprise your whole organization! The key message: In today’s fast-paced workplace, learning and innovating are the keys to success. This means rookies can often outperform experienced workers thanks to the rookie advantage. Thankfully, even senior executives can keep their rookie advantage by staying open to new ideas and inspiration. Actionable advice: In the office, assume a new role or swap jobs for a day. Or, volunteer somewhere outside the office. Is someone at work going on holiday for a few days? Offer to take on some of their tasks and responsibilities. New challenges trick your mind into stepping back in time, to when you were a true rookie. It’s an easy way to get the brain used to learning, asking questions, innovating and enjoying the rookie advantage again.

Sutton and Huggy Rao","summary":"Why can’t all the stores in a city be as popular among customers as the ones in the city center? Why can’t all the research units in a university top the league tables? Why can’t your favorite football team play as well as the one from the neighboring city? If those questions have ever crossed your mind, you’re probably interested in finding out how you can replicate something excellent in another place and with other people. Because we all want more of the good stuff, right? In Scaling Up Excellence, co-authors Sutton and Rao help readers understand the challenges involved in spreading outstanding practices and behavior. The book is not only packed with the latest research and a range of examples but also provides you with practical advice for your individual scaling challenge. In this book, you’ll find out: why military knowledge is essential to spread best practices, how knowing about Buddhism and Catholicism can help you to better scale up, how disruptive employees can start to outperform all other employees, and how watermelons saved the lives of university students. Scaling is one of the major challenges that every leader or executive in a successful organization faces. Scaling refers to the practice of spreading the excellent performance that always exists somewhere in the organization to more people and more places. That’s why scaling is also called the “problem of more.” But creating more commendable behavior looks very different in each different organization. For instance, scaling can mean growing a technology start-up from twenty to forty employees, opening a new burger store in another country, or reducing treatment errors in hospitals. Moreover, scaling not only requires replicating best practices but improving performance along the way. In other words, the “problem of more” is also a “problem of better.” Scaling requires the drive to keep innovating, change organizational behaviors and structures, and find better strategies of delivering your product or service. Take the Bridgewater International Academies, a chain of elementary schools in developing countries. It scaled up from one school in 2009 to over 210 today. During its scaling process, the leadership team not only focused on growing the organization but also on improving their practices. For instance, they’re currently working on a new initiative that equips teachers with customized content to work better with students who have different abilities. Scaling is an important yet tricky organizational challenge. And while there’s no easy recipe for effective scaling, if we look at successful examples, we can glean some fundamental principles and strategies for success. So, you want to spread excellent behavior in your firm? Before you start any kind of scaling effort, put your running shoes on – and you’re not just going for a sprint! Scaling is like running a marathon, so be prepared for a long, strenuous journey before feeling the satisfaction of finishing the race. When setting out to improve your organization’s performance, you need endurance to overcome unforeseen setbacks and nasty roadblocks. You can imagine scaling as waging a ground war instead of an air war. While an air war is a fairly quick and safe way to attack an enemy, it is rarely enough to defeat them. In terms of scaling, the analogy implies that you need to invest time, manpower and resources to “conquer” each opponent. For instance, during Facebook’s first years, Mark Zuckerberg worked with every employee to make sure they were fully committed to the company’s vision and values. Even now, new hires go through an intensive, six-week program where they need to prove themselves in different teams, understand the company’s culture and work with a mentor. Facebook fights the ground war and knows that investing hard work and a considerable amount of time into training new hires will grow their commitment and improve their contributions to the company. Having perseverance means starting from and with the people. So don’t think about scaling as pushing one person a thousand feet forward but, rather, as pushing a thousand people one foot forward. Here’s one great example of the way persistence and people orientation make it possible to outperform competitors: After a successful college football career at Stanford, Andy Papa worked in the pit crew for a motorsports company. Recognizing inefficiencies in their system, he used his know-how from the sports world to scale up. He recruited members from different crews and had the team follow a strict exercise, practice and learning regimen; in the end, the crew was able to significantly speed up its work during races. Now that you’ve decided you’re in it for the long term, it’s time to learn about one of the most important trade-offs on your scaling endeavor. When trying to spread outstanding performance, you’ll most likely navigate between two poles. The first one is standardization. Standardization describes a process in which much of what you’re trying to spread is pre-determined – usually an ideal model. The authors call this approach “Catholicism” because it’s reminiscent of the highly centralized approach of the Catholic Church. One Catholic Church example is the successful US burger chain In-N-Out Burger. Every store is an exact copy of the other, and employees wear the same clothing, receive the same training and follow the same rules. The second pole is local variation. In this practice, a commonly shared mindset guides people’s overall behavior, but specific actions can vary tremendously. Due to its similarities with the religion, the authors call this approach “Buddhism.” Swedish furniture giant IKEA takes a locally varied approach. Although it sells its items in pieces for customers to assemble themselves in most parts of the world, it offers home delivery and assembly services in China because the DIY approach is not very popular there. But let’s get one thing straight: your main question isn’t to choose “Catholicism” or “Buddhism” but to find the balance that best suits your company. The healthcare company Kaiser Permanente is a good example of a company with a mixed approach. When implementing an electronic health record system across the organization, it defined a couple of non-negotiable points and allowed for regional adjustments. Although the name “KP Health Connect” was mandatory and the sensory experience – the look, feel and touch of the application – had to be the same in every region, each local chapter could choose their favorite configurations of the same software. In the following blinks, we’ll discuss some of the practical principles, methods and tools you can use to scale up successfully. Imagine you’re at the beginning of your scaling endeavor. Where exactly will you start? Your first step is communicating the scaling effort in a way that motivates your organization to want to scale. There are two ways to go about this message: either you target people’s beliefs or their behavior. Some say you need to change people’s beliefs first because beliefs guide people’s actions. Imagine you want to increase the number of students who wear a helmet when they ride a bike to campus. You could work the belief angle by asking a student who has had an accident without wearing a helmet to share his story. This will most likely create a strong emotional connection to the issue and might cause students to change their beliefs about wearing a helmet. Stanford University took this approach and, lo and behold, it worked. However, some studies show that it’s best to target people’s behavior first because it can change their beliefs. Applying the behavior approach to the same example, you could, for example, encourage students to wear personally designed helmets so wearing a helmet feels fashionable. Studies suggest that, over time, their beliefs would change and they’d prefer to wear a helmet. Both approaches work in practice. So whichever approach you choose, just try to remember one thing: it doesn’t matter where you start to get people on board your scaling effort. All that matters is that you start where it works best for you. So you’ve taken the first few steps in your scaling journey. Now what? As your scaling effort grows, you’ll need to bring in more people, more organizational layers and more resources to keep it growing. However, one of the main pitfalls of scaling up is adding too much complexity before it’s necessary. If you add too many people, standards and rules too fast, you’ll get what experts call the disease of a “big dumb company.” Let’s say you’re working as a sales manager in a shop and a customer requests a refund on a damaged product. Could you imagine if you had to obtain the approval of nine people at your company before deciding that small matter, rather than just relying on your own competence? That’s exactly what happened to the sales staff of West Coast gas stations, where red tape had gotten out of control, and employees often needed months to solve minor issues. But however careful you are, you can’t always prevent unnecessary burdens from building up because things change over time; what might have worked well for years could become unwieldy down the road. The solution is for you to always be on the lookout for redundant rules and practices. For instance, at the software company Adobe, leaders decided to abolish formal annual performance reviews. Instead they installed more frequent, personalized check-ins, i.e., regular conversations about performance and career progression, between line managers and their employees. Switching to informal check-ins cut out unnecessary formal documentation duties of leaders, while simultaneously creating space for managers to have more effective talks with their employees in support of their personal development. Involving the right people in your scaling effort is critical to its success. But you don’t only need excellent people with the right skills and training, you also need people who are accountable and act in the company’s interests at all times. The difficulty is to find people with both excellent skills and accountability. Tamago-Ya, a Tokyo-based food delivery company, solved that problem by employing mainly high-school dropouts as drivers. It may sound paradoxical, but once the drivers are properly trained, Tamago-Ya has the best employees it could wish for: they know Tokyo’s quirks better than many other locals, they’re good at dealing with customers, and they pick up local news that might be interesting for the company. Plus, the drivers are accountable to the organization, as they depend on being trained and paid, and are grateful for getting the chance to work for the company. Wondering what specific practices could help you build a company like Tamago-Ya? There’s a whole spectrum of things you can do to help build talent with accountability. One good method is to build a feeling of shared purpose and collective belonging. At multinational gas and oil company BP, managers treat the company as a sports team and foster an excellent team spirit by mobilizing employees against the competition. The company wants to be better than Shell, its main competitor, by “slamming the clam” (the clam being part of Shell’s logo). By following BP’s example of promoting pride, belonging and identity, and by building on internal values and strengths in your organization, you can clearly set yourself apart from your competition. What’s even better than having excellent and accountable people who spread exemplary behavior throughout your organization? Deep connections between as many of them as possible: the power of spreading good behavior lies, not only in people, but in numbers. In other words, diversity will help spread good behaviors more reliably than anything else. Diversity helps to anchor your effort in many different departments, locations and functions in your organization. It also helps to show that scaling benefits different stakeholders across the organization, not just one group. When airline JetBlue tries to solve a fundamental operations problem, a manager invites a wide range of employees with varying backgrounds to discuss the situation: baggage handlers, gate control agents, mechanics, pilots, flight supervisors and managers, of different ethnic origins and ages. The rule of thumb for making the most of your company’s diversity is to target your employees by using many different tools in many different ways. Imagine you want to spread best practices for reducing energy use in your company – you may want to combine two strategies to publicize your initiative. On the one hand, the CEO of your company could openly embrace the campaign by issuing a message that calls on people to reduce their energy use. On the other, you could also hold a bazaar-style event where employees share their stories about how they minimize energy use, thereby allowing them to connect on a more personal level. By employing these two different strategies, you’ll be more successful in catering to the diverse needs, preferences and motivations of the people within your organization. One of the biggest threats to your scaling effort is bad behavior: it is extremely contagious and can cancel out the benefits or even destroy excellent behavior. Many of us have lived through it before: we’ve worked in a team where one member undermined the entire group’s performance by lying or taking credit for others’ performance. Research on group effectiveness has also shown that group performance decreases by 30 or 40 percent if just one person with a disruptive mindset joins the group! That’s because negative emotions are likely to infect the whole group. Plus, team members need much more time and energy to figure out how to deal with the grumbler. Experts in social research summarize this using the “broken windows theory.” In a neighborhood where there are broken windows, criminals will start breaking more windows, and others might join in by breaking into houses. The problem is that destructive behavior proliferates and escalates quickly. Even small acts can be extremely damaging to the performance of your organization. Since destructive behavior is so infectious, leaders need to address it with vigilance and perseverance before trying to spread excellent practices. Having no tolerance for bad behavior is a good mindset to start with. From there, many tools and practices can help. While firing might be an option, there are other ways to deal with people that undermine the performance in your organization. Coaches at d.school, Stanford University’s design school, put together a group made up of only disruptive characters to work together under the guidance of a coach. Some of the results were remarkable! Although they were all people with big, extroverted personalities who tended to undermine others, when these disruptive people were among similarly disruptive people, they were on the same level and thus balanced each other out. There’s just one last piece of the puzzle necessary for completing a successful scaling approach. Namely, positioning yourself in the future and imagining that your scaling initiative has already been completed. Experts call this technique performing a project premortem. To practice this technique, split your team into two groups. Tell one group to imagine that the scaling effort has been a spectacular success and the other that it has been a huge disaster. Then, both groups share their story as if it had already happened, identifying as many causes of the respective success or failure as possible. For instance, someone in the first group might say, “The scaling effort was a big success because we devoted our attention to keeping our care patient-centered.” You’ll quickly see the advantages of this technique. It helps address possible roadblocks more openly and keeps overly optimistic tendencies in check. Management research shows that this technique increases people’s ability to accurately identify the causes, barriers and enablers for future results by 30 percent. When you reason from a place in the future, you can ask many more questions. Was the scaling effort actually feasible? Was spreading excellent behavior worth the time and money spent? Imagine you’re trying to grow the start-up you recently founded. Position yourself in the future and ask: Am I content with the company I’ve created? Chances are you’re similar to Mitch Kapor. He started Lotus, a technology company, in 1982. It soon became very successful and grew quickly. However, once Lotus was operating like a big corporation, Kapor realized it wasn’t a place for him anymore: he didn’t feel at home running a large company with all its hierarchies, routines and standards. A premortem could’ve saved Kapor his disappointment! The key message in this book: Spreading excellence is one of the trickiest challenges facing organizations. To successfully spread outstanding performance to more places and people, leaders need to engage as many different people with determination and persistence, cut unnecessary complexity and ruthlessly eradicate destructive behavior. Actionable advice: Take scaling efforts one step at a time. The next time you’re thinking about taking the next big step forward – whether it’s improving the performance of your team, accelerating the start of your new career or influencing a group to take on your policy proposal – remember to take a ground war mentality. Rather than focusing on making one big leap forward, you need to press all people steadily and persistently towards your goal. Try on a new pair of shoes every once in a while. If you’re faced with conflict between people, teams or whole departments, use the “Freaky Friday” management tool. Just switch the roles of the opponents around, and you’ll see how walking in each other’s shoes for some time will help each of you recognize your part in the problem and get the group to cooperate. Don’t underestimate the power of fun. When you’re thinking about ways to create buy-in for your effort, make it fun. People are more likely to support you wholeheartedly if doing so gives them joy and pleasure. Throw people a “birthday” party on their first working day or create an online market where people can playfully vote, back, invest and improve each other’s ideas.

Hare","summary":"Do you know people at work who lie constantly for apparently no good reason? Do they also seem slick and charming, but really just work people like tools to get what they want? Do they avoid responsibility and act impulsively? Do they take credit for the work of others? If so, that person might be a psychopath. Not all psychopaths wind up in jail; some wheedle their way into big corporations and become so-called corporate, or white-collar, psychopaths. Once they’re in, they manipulate their bosses, colleagues and subordinates to get what they want while destroying everyone in their way. In the following blinks, you’ll find out what psychopaths are like and why they’re able to easily identify and take advantage of your weaknesses, even if you’re a trained psychologist. You’ll also discover the simple divide-and-conquer tactics psychopaths use to manipulate their way into power in a company while keeping coworkers and bosses in the dark about their true nature. Finally, you’ll discover how you can prepare yourself for the unfortunate event of having a psychopath in your life. Because although they’re a rare occurrence, it’s likely you’ll meet one sooner or later, and you don’t want to become their lunch. For most people, the mention of the word “psychopath” evokes images of serial killers and evil villains from movies, like the disturbing character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. But how accurate of a depiction is that, really? Some one percent of the general population fit the criteria of the personality disorder known as psychopathy. We will dive into the traits of such individuals soon, but first we must acknowledge that there is some truth to the Hollywood image: psychopaths do tend to be more violent and prone to criminality than the general population. Though they represent only one percent of the general population, they are responsible for over half the serious and violent crimes that occur in society. Their violence is especially chilling since it tends to lack any emotional component; rather it's usually a cold means to an end. However, not all psychopaths are violent criminals and, in fact, the definition and diagnosis of psychopathy is a complicated and difficult matter. Perhaps the best description can be extracted from a diagnostic tool called the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R). The checklist states that psychopathic behavior is exhibited as abnormalities in four domains of personality. In each domain, the specific psychopathic traits can be identified as follows: In the interpersonal domain, psychopaths are superficial, deceitful and grandiose. In the emotional domain, psychopaths lack empathy, remorse and the ability to take any responsibility for their actions. In the lifestyle domain, psychopaths tend to lack life goals and act in a very irresponsible and impulsive way in general. Finally, in the antisocial domain, psychopaths typically have a history of lacking behavioral control, evidenced by delinquency in adolescence and adulthood. These traits paint a compelling picture of remorseless, impulsive predators who take what they want and care little for the rules of society. However, a word of caution: readers should not jump to conclusions about themselves or someone else being a psychopath based on these criteria, as only qualified professionals can make such diagnoses, and even perfectly normal people may exhibit several of these traits. Unfortunately, sooner or later, you’re likely to meet a psychopath. When this happens, you’ll probably have no idea who you’re dealing with. Most psychopaths wind up in prison because they lack the skills to manipulate people to get what they want, forcing them to resort to a more direct approach: violence. But psychopaths who are not incarcerated are much more subtle and capable manipulators. They often use the following three-stage process: First, in the assessment phase, psychopaths will evaluate their victims’ utility to them, e.g., the victims’ ability to provide them with money, power, sex, celebrity, recognition and so on. At the same time, psychopaths will also assess their victims’ weak spots. Not distracted by emotions or social inhibitions, psychopaths are experts at reading people, and can easily identify their needs, likes, vulnerabilities and emotional hot buttons. Second, in the manipulation phase, psychopaths extract what they wants from the victim. They do this by changing their personality into a completely fictitious character: whoever is needed to manipulate the victim. Psychopaths are pathological liars and can quickly make up whatever stories they think will strengthen the bond with their victims. They are incredibly adept at managing the impression they make on others and can change their apparent personality to suit any situation: anxious victims find them soothing and bored victims find them exhilarating. A chameleon changing its color to snare a fly seems an apt analogy. Finally, in the abandonment phase, when victims are no longer useful to them, psychopaths discard them abruptly, typically cutting off all contact. The victim is often left in emotional turmoil, shocked at the betrayal of a supposedly close friend or lover. Psychopaths do not feel regret or remorse over this action like normal people. In fact, they don’t feel any emotion at all: brain imaging experiments have shown that psychopaths’ brains do not react to emotional material like the brains of normal people. They know that other people have things called emotions, but they neither feel nor appreciate them themselves. Just like any other predator, a psychopath also knows where to find his victims. Favorite targets include affinity groups like charities or religions, because such groups are built on mutual trust, which is easy to take advantage of. Consider the example of conman Bryan Richards, who became a prominent member of a small-town religious community by claiming he was a Christian. He even had his own radio show as “the rock jock who spins for Jesus.” Secretly, though, he was running numerous scams like selling fake timeshares to fellow Christians and a Christian dating service so he could chase numerous women. Big companies are also attractive targets for psychopaths because their employees need to trust each other, and the corporate world often offers handsome rewards like money, power and prestige. However, the organizational controls in big businesses make it difficult for psychopaths to thrive. Psychopaths are not team players and have no interest in the company’s goals, nor do they care about the rules, processes or regulations of a company, so, normally, they would be quickly spotted and ousted. This is where corporate psychopaths come in. They’re psychopaths who have the necessary skills and self-control to not only avoid prison, but to manipulate coworkers, management systems, and so forth, so that they can thrive in companies. As you can imagine, employing corporate psychopaths can ruin companies. Their abusive behavior increases employee churn, as motivated, talented employees leave. At the same time, psychopaths’ grandiose risk-taking nature and their disregard for rules leads to erratic strategic choices and even law-breaking, putting the entire company in jeopardy. So how do corporate psychopaths weasel their way into companies? The answer is simple: through lies and charm. As pathological liars, psychopaths can easily make up impressive resumes and concoct stories of their prior experiences to suit the role at hand. Since interviewing and selecting candidates is always a subjective process, psychopaths can also greatly benefit from their ability to charm interviewers. Once psychopaths have entered an organization, they start assessing the utility of everyone there. This is made easier by the fact that new employees are actually expected to actively seek out and meet everyone in the company in their first months. Psychopaths can thus easily assess the utility of coworkers, bosses and support staff, and then charm the relevant ones. Of course, all new employees try to be charming when, for example, they meet their boss for the first time – that’s normal. The difference is that psychopaths have no intent of ever delivering any actual work. When meeting their new colleagues, a psychopaths is primarily interested in identifying and bonding with pawns that can provide him with useful resources: money, information, expertise, influence, and so forth. A corporate psychopath can, for example, deliberately build a bond with technically proficient coworkers with the goal of manipulating them to do his own work. Psychopaths often target people who have informal power in an organization, meaning those who are well-liked and whose opinions are valued. In one example, a psychopath bonded with a secretary just to hear gossip circulating around the company and also to spread glowing rumors about himself. Through their charm, charisma and ability to change their personality, psychopaths convince pawns that they are their trusted companions. Often, the pawns become so enamored and loyal that they refuse to believe anyone who speaks ill of the psychopath. In addition to pawns, psychopaths also look for patrons. Typically, a patron is a high-level executive who has had only limited interaction with the psychopath, but their few meetings have been so impressive that the patron is willing to take the psychopath under his wing, fast-tracking the psychopath’s career and even protecting him from detractors. Eventually, the psychopath is likely to depose the patron, who has expended his or her organizational influence to promote and protect the psychopath. Thus the patron becomes a patsy. In addition to pawns and patrons, psychopaths also put people in companies into other categories. If a psychopath sees that an employee has no utility to offer, that person is deemed a low-utility observer, and ignored. This means that, in fact, such employees are in a uniquely objective position to observe the psychopath and realize that he’s manipulating others. Unfortunately, few voice these concerns to management because they fear the psychopath’s or his patron’s influence. Companies typically also have some form of organizational police in departments like Human Resources or Security. Their job is to protect the organizations from harm, and they pose a clear threat to psychopaths because they’re so adept at spotting fraudsters. Unfortunately, they often lack the necessary management support to take action, especially as psychopaths often have supporters in upper-management positions. One additional challenge for corporate psychopaths is that they can’t discard pawns easily once their utility is depleted. The shared work environment makes the sudden shunning and abandonment all the more obvious. Initially, the pawns often wonder if they’ve done something wrong. Eventually though, some pawns may actually confront their former “friend” or even bring the matter to management. Unfortunately, by this stage, the psychopath has already spread false rumors about the pawn to undermine the latter’s credibility. For example, the psychopath may have given upper management the impression that the pawn is not a team player and complains a lot, so the pawn’s complaint about the psychopath only serves to verify this. In the mean time, the psychopath has probably taken all the credit for the pawn’s work, so he seems like a glowing employee by comparison. It’s not hard to guess who of the two will get fired when a conflict arises. How can organizations protect themselves when psychopaths come charging at their gates? Naturally, the best defense is to never let them in at all, so the interviewers who make hiring decisions have a great responsibility. Unfortunately, discerning impostors from promising candidates is not easy: psychopaths are pathological liars, have no social inhibitions or fears, and are experts at reading people, making them very impressive or even downright dazzling in interviews. Luckily, there are ways that interviewers can avoid being taken in by a psychopath. First of all, make a plan of the topics you want to cover in the interview and stick to it. Psychopaths are experts at avoiding inconvenient questions and changing the topic to something more beneficial to them. Whatever you do, don’t lose control of the interview; ensure that you’re the one deciding which questions are answered. Second, never settle for vague answers because psychopaths like to speak in grandiose terms and gloss over any inconsistencies with deliberate vagueness. In fact, it always makes sense to dig deeper for details until you get tangible examples of the skills the candidate claims to have. Third, ask for work samples. Psychopaths rarely have any actual technical expertise, so they can’t demonstrate things like reports they’ve written. This may help in deterring them from applying. Fourth, try to get multiple data points. Take copious notes in the interview so you can objectively see if the candidates answers change in follow-up interviews, and also compare notes with other interviewers to spot any discrepancies. Finally, call references and do background checks on the internet. These are simple yet crucial steps in uncovering fraudulent applicants. Of course, when organizations promote people internally, they must also be careful. One potential red flag is if the candidate has been consistently unable to form a team. This could indicate a psychopath’s unwillingness to share credit or accept blame, which often derails teams quickly. If you’re unlucky enough to become the target of a psychopath, you are in for a wild, emotionally draining and eventually devastating ride. Most likely, you won’t realize what you’re dealing with until it’s too late, but there are a few ways to prepare yourself. First, know your enemy: learn about psychopathy. Understand the traits of a psychopath to see past their “mask” of normality. However, be careful you don’t start diagnosing people around you, especially not based on a mere few traits. It takes a qualified professional to make such judgments, and the “psychopath” label is too serious to be wielded carelessly. You should also familiarize yourself with the three-stage manipulation process described earlier. Second, learn about yourself. What are your weaknesses, likes and emotional hot buttons? What riles you up? What makes you like someone? Psychopaths are experts at reading people, and will easily spot and push these buttons to manipulate you. For example, you may be insecure about your looks and always respond positively when complimented on them. A psychopath will take advantage of this to build rapport with you and extract favors. In addition, it’s important to understand how you might be useful to psychopaths. Do you have a resource that they want? Or do you wield power, formal or informal, in a group with resources? Psychopaths have been known to target people like hurricane victims who have lost everything, so don’t think not being wealthy will protect you. Finally, try not to get sucked into the psychopath’s game. It’s very easy to be swayed by a psychopath’s charm, so when you feel you’re bonding with someone unnaturally quickly, try to think critically about your first impression, and how plausible their stories really are. Of course, this is easier said than done. In fact, even one trained prison psychologist was so taken in by a psychopath that she lied at his parole hearings in the hope that they would get married once he was released. She lost her job and her reputation as a result. Now that you know that corporate psychopaths exist, you may well want to know what you can do when you meet one at work? Besides the tips presented in the previous blink, the work environment presents a few additional considerations. First, as always, relationships and reputation are important, but especially so when dealing with a psychopathic boss or coworker. You should also try to build a reputation as a high performer. By always doing your best, you build a solid reputation against any rumors the psychopath may spread about you, and also stop him from using any poor performance against you. Second, you should get to know your company’s formal processes and procedures, such as your personal obligations and the best channels to voice concerns. Know your options for filing a formal complaint against an abusive boss or coworker, for example. Third, whenever possible, try to get work assignments, performance feedback, and so forth, in writing. Even if your boss isn’t a psychopath, this approach ensures that you’ll have a mutual understanding of what is meant. For example, when you see your performance review on paper, make sure it’s detailed and clear. Always ask for justifications if there is any negative feedback. Fourth, whatever you do, avoid confrontations and always keep calm. The psychopath will deliberately push your buttons to try to make you explode at a moment that will make you look bad. If attacked, defend your decisions with reason and calmly state the facts, that’s it. Finally, if necessary, leave on your own terms. If your boss is a psychopath, truth be told, you are likely in a no-win position. It may be that your only recourse is to find another job. Try to get references from all over the company, not just from your boss, and try not to burn any bridges on your way out. The key message in this book: Not all psychopaths are in prison: many of them put on suits and roam corporate offices. They use their incredible impression management skills to charm victims and extract whatever favors they want, often rapidly advancing up the corporate ladder at the expense of their colleagues and the company. The only hope for those involved is to quickly spot these predators before they destroy the organization. Actionable advice: Know thyself. Ask your family and close friends – the people who know you best – to describe how they see you: strengths, weaknesses and all. You might well be surprised at what you hear, and this will help you better understand what emotional hot buttons you have that a psychopath may take advantage of. Know your company. If you don’t already, spend some time getting to know the rules and formal processes of the company you work for. It is good to know what options are at your disposal, and also it will help you spot any situations where someone – psychopath or not – asks you to do something which may be in violation of those regulations.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Whether you’re looking for a good Java developer or a bookkeeping expert, sifting through resumes or querying colleagues is time consuming. The kicker? As technology gets more complicated and the job market evolves, it’s only going to get harder and harder to find the best potential employees to work for you. This is where the magic of magnetism can help you. Great recruiting strategies aren’t really about your personal contacts or social media networks, but about attracting people to your company with a force so strong, it feels like you’re not even recruiting at all. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why like all good relationships, recruiting is about mutual love; how Apple as a company has mastered magnetism; and how LinkedIn rewarded its employees and caused a social media uproar. Why is it so hard for CEOs and senior executives to find good talent today? Since there are so many people looking for work, you’d think that this would signal an abundance of great talent. But this isn’t the case. Many positions remain vacant due to an underlap between the skills people possess and the skills for which most companies are looking. In sum: there aren’t enough people with the right kind of skills to fill open positions. Why is that? For one, it’s extremely challenging for workers to keep their skills up to speed with changing technology, tech that today’s companies need to use. So companies should invest in programs today that will attract tomorrow’s talent. Statistics argue that by 2018, 1.4 million tech-related jobs will open up in the United States alone, yet only 400,000 college graduates will able to fill these positions. To tackle this dilemma, savvy companies such as Neustar have already started to think ahead by sponsoring a technology, information and digital media center for young adults. Another way to promote talent and make personal connections beneficial to your company’s future is  to sponsor or get involved with a club or program at a local university. Bear in mind it’s not just employees’ skills that are evolving, it’s also their needs and wants. Failing to take these issues into account may mean you are running your company on a myth that can hurt its prospects. We’ll explore these concerns in the following blinks. With dynamic economies all over the world and countless possibilities to grab potential employees, you need to stop betting that people will stick around even if you don’t treat them well. The days when you could smugly assume your employees were lucky to have any job are gone, so eliminating such assumptions is your first step toward drawing and retaining great talent. For a relationship between a company and an employee to gel, there needs to be mutual attraction. So how do you make your company irresistible to a potential employee? Employee rewards and recognition are pivotal in attracting and retaining talent. For instance, the CEO of LinkedIn gave all the company’s employees an iPad Mini to show his gratitude for their results. Straight away, the news swept over Twitter and Facebook as employees gushed about their gift. This generated more genuine buzz than any recruiting advertisement could have. Such gestures make others want to work for such an organization. But such a strategy isn’t just about having a big budget. Start by acknowledging top employees by giving them a few hours off, or gifting something memorable but not so expensive, such as concert tickets. Even modest offerings go a long way, as they make employees feel appreciated. Aside from actively recognizing your employees, create a magnetic organization that attracts only the best talent by standing out from the crowd. Make sure your company’s benefits satisfy those who don’t just want to pay the bills but who also are seeking challenges and training opportunities in addition to professional and personal growth. Instead of squandering 20 to 30 percent of annual revenue on job boards and recruitment events, create a domino effect of employee satisfaction! The next time you pass an Apple store, take a quick look inside. You’ll notice a magnetic organization where employees and customers are smiling and energetic. Apple’s happy employees are the reason they don’t have a problem recruiting top talent. Their employee satisfaction leads them to work better, which leads to satisfied customers, which loops back to positive energy and a highly appealing organization. It’s no wonder so many people want to work for Apple! While you may be the best and most innovative company around, do people know? Image is everything, so working effectively to influence how people perceive your company is vital. This means targeting your employment brand. Your employment brand is made up of how your current and past employees perceive your company. To have a strong employment brand that draws in employees, you need to ask yourself some questions. What makes your organization attractive? What keeps the best talent at your company? What makes your company better than others? Do you have a creative company environment? How would you describe your company: is it innovative? Intense? Relaxed? Rewarding? How do people outside the company describe your employees?   Enlist the help of employees, customers or even vendors to answer these questions. Then compare the results with how you believe your company’s culture should be. To further promote your brand, go online. Glossy brochures communicating your brand image no longer cut it. You need to get sophisticated. Communicate your brand through social media outlets and through your website. Put together a team of employees who represent your brand and ask them to work together to design recruitment pages on the site. It’s also worth budgeting for the resources you need to project the image you want. This could mean employing videographers, professional photographers and so on. Next, create a job board on your Facebook page where resumes can be uploaded directly, and tailor your advertising campaigns to the location, education and interests of the kind of talent you want to attract. Recruiting and attracting people through social media is fairly low risk and cost-effective. And if it turns out that another approach better fits your organization, it’s easy to drop this plan. Did you ever think how your recruitment strategy can determine whether you are triumphant over your competitors? While competing companies are battling to find the talent to match their short-term goals, you can get ahead by employing the right people from the outset. You should aim for a sustainable work environment, where your recruitment strategy not only meets your organization’s long-term goals but also keeps your employees happy and loyal. When recruiting new employees, keep in mind they need to possess a blend of knowledge and technical skills in addition to well-rounded skills, which are crucial for long term success. It’s easy to spot well-rounded skills when employees go the extra mile to please clients. So your goal is to get your employees to want to make this difference. For instance, the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain has a policy which allows employees to spend up to $2,000 to encourage guests to feel completely at ease and happy with the hotel’s service. It’s not necessary to be quite so lavish, of course; on a smaller scale, this might mean offering a $5 certificate and an apology in an effort to correct a mistaken food order at a restaurant, for example. Instead of waiting to change until your business is flailing or your competitor ups the ante, take the upper hand now by investing in your staff. Show your employees that you trust them and cultivate a safe, comfortable environment where they can develop personally and professionally. One way to do this is to make sure they feel that you respect and value their efforts. Nobody wants to let people down who believe in them! This not only benefits the organization, but comes back around and benefits your employees, too. The key message in this book: There must be mutual attraction for a employer-employee relationship to work. Through offering attractive, tailored benefit packages to employees, employers can be confident that the best talent will seek the company out. By building a magnetic company, firms can also cut recruiting costs and benefit from a constant influx of motivated, qualified young recruits, proficient in adapting to modern technology and a changing economy. Actionable advice: Don’t lie. One way to be a trusted employer is to tell the truth. For example, don’t say that you’re “laying off” people when you’re firing bad performers. Layoffs that are actually a euphemism for firing is toxic to your reputation and makes it hard to rehire. If a staff member asks you if there will be cuts in the future and you think it’s a possibility, don’t lie. Say the situation is being looked into, as opposed to making promises you can’t deliver on.

Palmer","summary":"We have so many meetings. Why do so many feel like a waste of time? Whether it’s a team meeting, a one-on-one with your boss, colleague, or employee, or even the conversation when a boy likes a girl and doesn’t know what to say to her, we all struggle with saying what we want to say. That’s where these blinks about lean talks come in. Talking lean means saying something clear, direct and to-the-point, in a polite, calm, courteous manner. That’s the best way to stop wasting everyone’s time and get the most of meetings! In this blinks, you’ll find out when to start a sentence with “You” vs. “I”; why rhetorical questions can kill a meeting; and how to make sure what you say gets across. How many times have you had an unproductive meeting just because you were afraid of expressing what was really on your mind? Well, you can change that by announcing your intentions from the very first minute of the meeting. It’s important you make your purpose clear early on; the longer it is unclear, the more likely the other person or people will start to wonder or get suspicious that there’s something you’re not saying. Express your purpose in language that’s straightforward and direct without being brutal or rude. That way, you’re setting a polite, courteous precedent for the rest of the conversation. For example, imagine a manager has a talented but habitually tardy employee. She keeps reminding him to be on time, but since her tone is aggressive, he leaves remembering that his boss was rude, rather than remembering her point. What not to say: “Why on earth do you insist on arriving so late day in, day out?” Something better: “John, what can I do to ensure your punctuality in the future, so that we can avoid future confrontations on this matter?” The second way, John has to think about his actions and propose a plan for improvement, likely leading to a positive outcome. Preparation is important if you want your meetings to follow a similar trajectory. Think about what you want from the other person, and then work your way back to figure out the best way to achieve it. Then, you’ll be able to lead the conversation in a way that invites desirable responses from the other person. In other words, ask yourself, “What do I hope will happen at the end of the meeting?” Use the answer to structure your opening comments. This way, you’ll be able to communicate exactly what you’re thinking and ensure that the other person is following your message from the get-go. Now that you know how to successfully open a meeting, here’s how to proceed. Often we go into a meeting with thoughts and feelings we don’t have the courage to express. Instead of saying what’s on our mind, we make blunders or inadvertently communicate those unsaid ideas through gestures, facial expressions or body language. In other cases, we inhibit other people, preventing them from sharing their own perspectives on the matter. Irony and rhetorical questions can often have the effect of allowing us to impose a view of superiority, diminishing others’ interest in contributing. That’s why the best approach for any meeting or conversation is to speak from your own point of view. To that end, start sentences with the personal pronoun I, not you. For instance, instead of saying, “You are wrong,” you could say, “I disagree with you.” It’s also helpful to listen carefully to yourself and others. It’s not just a matter of listening with your ears: pay attention to the language other people use and let your intuition guide you. It’s easier said than done, because most of us tend to best remember information that has an emotional impact. Take notes and jot down the exact words and phrases others say, rather than paraphrasing or putting into your own words. Having other people’s words in your notes will allow you to later construct an accurate account of the meeting, as well as respond appropriately in the moment. And if you notice that you don’t fully understand something the other person said, just ask! Of course, as we mentioned earlier, it’s important to listen to yourself, too. While you’re writing down your colleagues’ words, ask yourself how you feel. And if you notice any doubt or unclarity in yourself, you can bring it up and talk it out. As we just learned, listening carefully is an important part of having a productive meeting. But that’s not all: responding appropriately to what the other person says is crucial, to elevate the conversation to a higher level. After all, you don’t want your response to block further discussion. This often occurs when people respond in a negative way, saying things tantamount to “That sucks!” Those kinds of responses leave little room for the other person to expand on their statements or further negotiate. Essentially, you need to find the right balance between making others feel more comfortable and making your own needs clear. To this end, it helps to pay attention to your sentence structure. For instance, if you don’t understand something the other person said, it’s a good idea to use the past tense and the pronoun, you: “What did you mean by what you just said?” or “What led you to agree to see me today?” On the other hand, if you want to project a certain amount of forcefulness, state your opinion using the present tense and the pronouns, I or me, using phrases like “I need,” “I like” and “I want.” Also, if you’re problem-solving, the other person may likely have a good solution. You want your language to create an invitation for the other person to take a position, make a proposal or unblock a situation. Either way, it can be elegantly done in order to move a meeting forward. Along those lines, if you want to identify a solution together, it’s best to use the future tense and the pronouns, we or us. For example, “What do we do from here?” or “If I [fill in the blank], what will you do to [fill in the blank]?” Ultimately, as long as you choose your words carefully and respond appropriately, you’ll eventually be able to resolve the problems or tasks at hand. Are you wondering why your conversation partner spent the whole time staring at the ceiling while you were making your opening remarks? We all do our best to interpret human gestures, but even after years of study and practice, there’s no hard science to body language. Thus, you’ll never properly surmise what someone’s thinking based on his or her body language. So, just ask! After all, by being open and curious about what’s happening around you, you’ll gain more respect and trust from the other people at the meeting. That clarity is conducive to productivity. By the same token, other people pick up on our body language as well. Your gestures and facial expressions will reveal your true thoughts no matter how hard you try to hide them. That’s why whenever we express an idea that we really believe in, our message has a tremendous impact on others. On the other hand, trying to conceal your true thoughts with gestures that don’t match your ideas will expose your lack of conviction. That will garble your message and make others suspicious. As we’ve seen, nonverbal communication can make things confusing, which is why it’s helpful to conduct a quality control at the end of your meetings, to check the impact of the thoughts and solutions discussed. Make sure your ideas have been fully understood and that everyone is happy with how the meeting went. Conducting quality control is easy. Ask these simple questions: The key message in this book: Productive meetings stem from having the courage to state openly what you want out of them. Try to listen carefully to what others are saying too, and avoid responding negatively, as this will only block further discussion. Also pay attention to what signals your body language might be sending. Actionable advice: Define your meeting goal. Next time you have a meeting planned, take a few minutes to think about exactly what you want to achieve with the people there. Then find a constructive way of expressing this goal and do so at the very start of the meeting.

Malone","summary":"We’re all familiar with the myth: the entrepreneurial giants of the world – people like Elon Musk and Bill Gates – had to fight their way to the top, single-handedly and against all odds. And of course that’s the story we’re fed. The tale of one person’s trajectory is more engaging than an exploration of a team’s dynamics. It’s also easier to put one person’s face on a magazine cover. But such success stories mislead. Behind each successful individual is a team. Indeed, good teams are at the heart of every thriving business. But what is a good team? And how do you create one? In these blinks, you’ll learn that there’s no “I” in Steve Jobs; what the cast of Friends can teach us about teams; and why you and your teammates should celebrate more. Technology is developing faster than ever; our world is increasingly interconnected; life as we know it may never be the same again – you’ve heard it all before, right? These days, we’ve more or less accepted that the world is changing, and fast. But have we learned to keep up with it? Businesses that want to survive within rapidly shifting markets must have one crucial skill: Maneuverability, that is, the ability to change direction quickly so that enterprise stays afloat. To get an idea of what maneuverability looks like in action, let’s take a look at Apple. Back in 2002, the future of the company was uncertain. And yet, in 2012, as other companies such as US Airways, Enron and Adelphia Communication Corporation were struggling with poor performance and bankruptcy, Apple was worth a whopping $656 billion. How did they pull this off? Well, Apple had met the needs of changing markets by successfully introducing not one but five groundbreaking products: the iPod, iTunes, the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple store. Time and time again, Apple proved capable of discerning what customers wanted, and acting on this information fast. At the heart of the company is a culture of risk-taking, agility and efficiency; employees simply wouldn’t dare approach Steve Jobs with a design or plan that was anything less than daring. This culture allowed the company to attract and keep talented employees through thick and thin. Maneuverability, risk-taking and brilliant employees are the three key ingredients to Apple’s recipe for success. But what brought it all together? Powerful teams. What exactly makes a team powerful? Find out in the coming blinks! The Egyptian pyramids are one of the world’s great mysteries. Not only are they filled with strange traps and untold treasures, their construction is also hard to fathom. Our best guess is that they were built with sheer manpower: 10,000 workers built them over the course of ten years. The pyramids demonstrate that humans are meant to work together. Teamwork is a common thread that runs through our evolutionary history. By connecting and cooperating with others, humans have made their own survival possible. This is even reflected in our very immune systems. Research shows that making genuine connections with other human beings boosts the genes that control our immune system. Further scientific investigations have also demonstrated that teamwork is what distinguishes us from other species. In one study, chimpanzees, capuchin monkeys and human children were given a puzzle to be solved in three stages. The capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees, with, respectively, low and moderate levels of intelligence, attempted to solve the problem alone. The human children, however, chose to work in teams, teaching each other tricks to solve the problem together. They even shared the reward for solving the puzzle! Of course, it’s no secret that we can work wonders when we work together. Think of open-source software, where tech whizzes all over the world collaborate to build new computer programs. The HTTP protocol and the Mozilla Firefox, for instance, wouldn’t exist without such collaborative efforts. Wikipedia is another great example of success through teamwork. The most viewed site in the world, Wikipedia is the culmination of efforts made by volunteer writers and editors that work together to make knowledge about our world more understandable and accessible. Even our pop culture is filled with stories of great teams. Think of Charmed, Friends or The Three Musketeers. Films and television shows that focus on the power of teamwork are often well loved for their portrayals of dissimilar individuals that come together and connect with each other. This is something companies can learn from, too! The president of Nissan Design, Jerry Hirshberg, has taken this lesson to heart. He kick-starts innovation by encouraging people with contrasting skills and abilities to collaborate. Their different ways of approaching a problem make them more likely to hit upon a unique solution, a process of innovation that’s at the heart of many of Nissan’s most popular vehicles. Teams at Nissan are diverse – that is, every individual has a unique set of strengths and weaknesses, of cultural and personal experiences. This gives them a specific mode of cognition. Some of us are holistic thinkers, for instance, while others are analytical thinkers. Great solutions result from a combination of these approaches. Holistic thinking entails seeing the big picture and then zooming in on particular details to solve problems. Solving problems analytically is a matter of focusing on the nitty-gritty details and then gradually building up a more comprehensive understanding. This contrast has been the subject of some interesting research. One study saw Japanese and American participants view a 20 second clip from an animated underwater video. American subjects focused on the brightly colored fish – that is, the objects in the foreground. The Japanese subjects, however, were more interested in the background images and the relationships between different fish and plants in the scene. How can we interpret this? Well, the American participants demonstrated analytical thinking, by focusing on specific details. Japanese participants had a more holistic approach, with their focus on the broader scene. Cultural differences like this should be a source of strength, not tension, in your team. With some members grasping the big picture while others pick out the details, there’s no problem your team can’t solve! Lovers and couples embody the most natural partnership humans can form: pairs. Pairs are common in businesses, too – particularly in stories of success. Although we all dream of making it big on our own, we often need a partner to overcome unforeseen challenges. Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz was determined to expand his business in the early ’90s. After opening a few hundred new stores across the United States, however, his company began to suffer. His ambitious expansion caused many problems; customer service deteriorated and communication between different levels of the company became poor. It was clear to Schultz that he needed someone that could return the art of customer service and employee engagement to Starbucks. Enter Howard Behar, who became president of Starbucks in 1995. Behar, whose personality complemented Schultz’s, had big ideas about employee culture, and he used his expertise to create a work environment that met the needs of employees. This inspired them to provide top-notch customer service, which made a world of difference at Starbucks. Thanks to the Schultz-Behar partnership, the company expanded internationally. Partners can differ in two ways: they can have contrasting personalities or contrasting skillsets. While Behar and Schultz had complementary personalities, the pair of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak was a winning one because of complementary skillsets. Jobs was a charismatic, entrepreneurial leader, while Wozniak was a veritable tech genius. However, even partners that aren’t total opposites can achieve success: they can simply push each other to be the best they can be. Bill Gates and Paul Allen exemplify this. These two former computer nerds took control of their destiny when they teamed up to form Microsoft. But, pairs in business don’t always remain pairs. Sometimes you need another person in the mix to really get the ball rolling. Find out about the power of trios in the next blink. Trios are a rare constellation. Why? Well, they tend to become pairs, by losing a member, or quartets, when another member joins. But when a trio is maintained, it can thrive like any other team. Trios often begin as pairs, but the way they gain their third member varies. This in turn can shape the nature of their teamwork. The two plus one trio is particularly common. They often form after an original pair with similar skillsets joins an individual with different strengths to achieve a common goal. Take Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, for instance. Brilliant physicists at Bell Labs, Brattain and Bardeen made a good team. So when their boss, William Shockley, was tasked with designing a solid-state amplifier, he enlisted the help of the Brattain-Bardeen duo. The two physicists worked together on the project, while Shockley used his supervisory and leadership skills to keep the project running smoothly. The result was their invention of the transistor in 1947. Less than a decade later, they were awarded the Nobel Prize as a trio for their efforts. When a partnership welcomes a third person to collaborate with each member of the pair individually, another type of trio forms: the parallel trio. An example of this trio type is the collaboration between Federico Faggin, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor, who all worked together in the ’70s at Intel to invent the microprocessor. Faggin and Shima were responsible for hardware design, while Faggin and Mazor worked on the operating code to load into the chip itself. This trio dynamic is particularly powerful because of third members like Faggin, who act as a synthesizer between two contrasting partners, preventing one from dominating, and ensuring the trio members’ objectives are aligned. Here’s a question for you: How many digits can you memorize at once? Most humans can only manage somewhere between five and nine. And here’s another question: How many team members can you handle at once? The answer is the same. Teams that range from five to nine members are the most effective, and the most common. Why? Well, teams this size are very functional. With five or more members, your team is large enough to elect an internal leader without their role causing tension or becoming redundant. Your team is also small enough that your leader is able to engage with each member personally. But it’s not too small, allowing for diversity among members. A sweet spot indeed! However, a leader of a five-to-nine team can sometimes be all too aware that he’ll need to have direct contact with the members he selects for the team. This often results in leaders making biased decisions when finding new members. But, in order to really make use of this optimized team model, a five-to-nine team leader must disregard personal preference, and choose members based on how they would benefit the whole team. What do wedding receptions, baby showers and New Year’s Eve parties have in common? Well, they all celebrate new beginnings. It’s something we all love to do, so why not celebrate the beginning of a new team, too? In a team’s life cycle, the first and most crucial step is always the team’s formation. The way a team begins will shape everything it does in the future, so it’s worth considering the three factors that matter most: diversity, communication and size. Diversity, as we learned in the previous blink, can give a team a major edge. A team with mixed strengths and backgrounds always has a better shot at success. But only if these teams are able to develop a common culture that keeps them together. Communication is another vital element for new teams. Communication allows teams to build a shared culture, to resolve personal disagreements, to designate roles effectively and to ensure everyone is aligned toward the same goal. It’s a simple solution, but regular meetings work wonders for team communication. If your team is too big for one room, you could look into video conferencing. But you’d be better off forming a smaller team in the first place. This brings us to the third crucial factor for forming teams: Size. Smaller teams not only have an easier time communicating; they’re also better at building strong bonds necessary for great teamwork. The team leader also plays a central role in ensuring these bonds develop and flourish. Why not commemorate the day your team came into existence with a “birthday”? On the very first day that your team gets to work, gather everyone together so they can meet and greet, and share their stories and contact information. This is also a great opportunity for the team leader to introduce the culture and values envisioned for the team project. But not by listing them in bullet points on a slideshow! Get your team engaged with its culture by designing a kickoff event that encourages the attitudes you want your team members to exercise during your project. The key message in this book: Humans can achieve great things when they work together. So make the most of teamwork by building teams that are diverse, connected and motivated. This will give your business the edge when solving new problems and embarking on projects.  Actionable advice: Show your team members you care! When a team member leaves a team, it’s best to take the opportunity to acknowledge their contribution to the project and show your appreciation. This practice is a cornerstone of great team culture. Similarly, when a new team member joins, welcome them with an event that introduces them to their fellow members and reinforces a uniting, positive team culture. Got feedback?

Maybe your computer suddenly crashes, maybe an important business partner (or an entire country) goes bankrupt or maybe your competitor unexpectedly invents a powerful machine that causes setbacks across all of your business’s departments – you never know. So how do you cope in such situations? You need to make sure you have the right teams in place. These blinks summarize the authors’ valuable advice on how organizations should be built and operate as a team of teams, appreciating the adaptability an organization needs to cope with unpredictable challenges and threats. In these blinks, you’ll discover why today’s madness for efficiency is indeed mad; how to prepare your organization for unpredictable threats and challenges; and what a plane crash at Portland’s airport and an emergency landing in the Hudson River can teach you about the structure of your organization. No matter what your job, the concept of efficiency won’t be new to you. In fact, you probably use it even when you’re just arranging your pencils on a desk! Efficiency is widely recognized as something worth achieving, and most of today’s organizations have set efficiency as their principal goal. Even outside of business, our society is obsessed with efficiency. From organizing our leisure time and life hacks to the management of international companies, everyone is trying to achieve the best results with the least effort; in other words, they want to be as efficient as possible. Our love for efficiency can be traced back to 1900, when Quaker Frederick Winslow Taylor laid the foundations of scientific management. By measuring various work processes in order to shave off every second he could throughout the production process, Taylor produced unprecedented results.   But in a complex world, efficiency does not equal success. The rapid development of information technology has changed the world we live in. Not only has it become much faster, but also more interdependent, meaning that a seemingly endless number of factors interact to produce highly unpredictable outcomes. Much like the theory that a butterfly’s wings in New York can start a hurricane in China, a YouTube video can start a revolution. In 2010, a man named Tarek protested police corruption in a small town in Tunisia by setting himself aflame. His cousin, who filmed the whole thing, posted it on YouTube where it was seen by millions of people. These people then started their own protests, which eventually led to the end of the 30-year reign of President Mubarak in neighboring Egypt. This outcome was entirely unpredictable at the time of Tarek’s protest. Taylor’s scientific management was designed for a world where an all-seeing manager could more or less accurately predict the outcomes of a given action. As our example shows, things are very different today. If today’s world is complex, so are the threats that lurk within it. These threats can come out of nowhere, from any direction and in any form. Looking back to the old way of doing things, Winslow Taylor’s logic teaches us to prepare for every problem and protect ourselves with the help of robust mechanisms. For example, if you live in a region where storms are frequent, build a backup generator in case the power goes out. Or if you have a poor relationship with your neighboring country, build a wall so they can’t get in. However, designing these protective mechanisms requires you to understand the nature of each threat. In a complex world, where you essentially don’t know where setbacks will come from or what they will look like, you can’t rely on these mechanisms alone. So how can we hope to protect ourselves from these unpredictable threats? The answer lies in adaptability. Modern-day organizations must be adaptable, able to respond quickly to unexpected dangers, or risk their doom. We can look to the author’s tenure as commander of the American Task Force in Afghanistan in 2003 as an example. Although this elite military unit had access to better resources than those of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and the American forces could win battles, they were still losing the war. They simply weren’t able to adapt to a war against an enemy that didn’t have a clear hierarchical structure, and that reacted to each attack with lightning fast reflexes. More firepower simply wasn’t doing the trick when the enemy could re-group in the blink of an eye. When you were in school, your teachers probably divided your class into groups for certain tasks. Why? Because teams can solve problems that one person alone cannot. It’s no different for companies. Working as a team ensures that companies can adapt to the many threats and challenges of the modern world. Compare this with efficiency-minded organization, where companies are structured around commands; the only person with access to all structures is the head honcho, and everyone else just follows her orders. The problem with this type of organization is that a single person simply can’t grasp the complexity of modern problems.  That’s exactly what happened in a 1978 plane crash at the Portland International Airport, which resulted in ten deaths. After a minor malfunction, the captain prolonged safety preparations until there was no more fuel, ignoring the advice of crew members telling him that the fuel was depleting. Clearly, they should have worked as a team. But what is it about teams that makes them so adept at navigating complexity? The trust and purpose that they share makes them perfect for solving complex problems. On a structural level, teams function completely differently from command structures. Team members, as opposed to bosses and subordinates, share a common purpose, and their common experiences inspire trust in one another.  This enables them to respond quickly in critical situations, with a shared understanding of which outcome is desirable and which actions each member must take to achieve that outcome. For example, after the accident at Portland’s airport, United Airlines recognized that the plane’s technology was too complex to be handled by one person alone. So, they introduced the Crew Resource Management program as a way to build teams. Did it work? Yes. Just compare the 1978 crash to the emergency landing on the Hudson River in 2009: although the crew only had a few minutes to land the plane, each team member immediately identified the specific actions they needed to take to ensure a safe landing without prior coordination. By now it’s clear that teams are advantageous in any environment that requires specialized knowledge. But how do you go about creating a team from your company’s thousands of employees? Simple. You build a team of teams!  A single team can’t include an endless number of members and still be effective. So, large companies must instead build multiple teams. By definition, team members work together closely, and trust each other greatly. To work closely, these teams have to be small; you simply can’t know and trust an endless number of people. Thus, companies with more than 150 people need to build multiple teams to stay effective. Once you’ve built your smaller teams, they will then work together as a larger team, just as individual team members work within their smaller teams.  Teams are a double-edged sword: Their structure allows organizations to enjoy the benefits of a quick, adaptable workflow. On the other hand, the close relationships built between the team members involves the necessary exclusion of those outside the team. When you have multiple teams working in your company, you need them all to share an understanding of the overall purpose and work processes of the other teams. Otherwise, you’ll only have half-finished solutions with pockets of incompetence that no one is overseeing. The author’s experiences in the American Task Force show what can go wrong when teams don’t understand one another. For example, when he visited the Task Force’s intelligence facilities, he found a storage room with unopened garbage bags full of intelligence that had been gathered on raids. The operatives on the field simply lacked the understanding of how the intelligence team operated. As a result, the time-sensitive intelligence wasn’t handled as such, and was thus delayed for several hours. When it was finally processed by an analyst, it was already too old. Clearly, teams are essential to effective organizations. But how do you build teams in a way that maximizes their effectiveness? Keep reading to find out! People sometimes say that knowledge is power, and this is absolutely true.  The right information can be a precious commodity. Traditionally, companies keep information secret – even within the organization – unless sharing it is absolutely necessary. For our purposes, information covers everything from sensitive data, like sales and marketing strategies, to simple things like how individual workers perform and how salaries are calculated. According to Taylor, sharing information is not only unnecessary, but also dangerous. Each employee needs to stay concentrated on their own part of the whole production process, meaning information should only be handled by the manager who oversees operations. However, today's complexity demands a more open approach to handling information: it should be shared. Sharing information, and thereby sharing an understanding of the complete system in which a team operates, is a prerequisite for good decision-making under complex conditions. If a team lacks a shared understanding of the overall context of their actions, they’ll make decisions that are good for the team, but not necessarily good for the company as a whole.  Think back to all the sensitive intelligence that was tucked away in garbage bags in a closet. The field operative thought they were doing their job well. After all, the raid was successful. They just lost sight of the context of their work: the success of the American Task Force! The author made a point of sharing information once he took command of the American Task Force in Iraq. He set up a Joint Operation Center in their base in Balad, where Task Force members could access all relevant information about their operations.  In addition, e-mails were sent to people who might be affected by certain operations, and the weekly Operations and Intelligence brief was televised to ensure that everyone in the Task Force could follow the development of operations. This way, information was no longer wasted. For a team of teams to really work, the smaller teams need to form bonds just like those the individual team members have within their own teams. As mentioned before, one of the reasons teams are so effective is because of the closeness and trust among team members, making them a tightly bonded group. In contrast, simply throwing a bunch of people into a room and telling them to work together doesn’t make them a team. Similarly, calling an organization a team of teams doesn’t make it one. Rather, the teams that comprise a team of teams must emulate the trusting relationships shared by members of a single team. The shared understanding, as well as the trust that the teams develop, form a kind of shared consciousness that causes them work together just like a single team would.  So how do you get entire teams to share the type of bond that is usually developed over the course of years between individuals? Well, the mechanics are basically the same: they simply need to share experiences.  As an example, consider the challenge the author faced when he decided to develop relationships between the different parts of the American Task Force and between the American Task Force and its partner agencies, such as the FBI and the CIA. Within the American Task Force, he started an exchange program, whereby members of different teams would spend at least six months in another division – a Navy SEAL would go to an Army Special Forces team, and vice versa.  When looking at your teams, if a member of one team can’t remember at least one friendly face from another team, it’s probably a good idea to have them share more experiences. This way, they’ll create tighter bonds. Imagine that you’re part of a team of teams. Everyone is communicating and working well together, but then challenges emerge that the teams want to tackle as a unit. As you begin to plan, your boss stops you in your tracks, loudly declaring that he alone makes the decisions. Strangely, that’s often how decisions are made. But is it right? In short, no. As we know, things change at amazing speed; to match that speed, companies must enable their teams to make decisions on their own. Today’s complex problems are the result of a fast-paced, interconnected world. Luckily, a team of teams with shared consciousness mirrors this interconnectedness. But that won’t mean much for you if your teams don’t enjoy a healthy amount of autonomy. Take it from the author: after introducing the shared consciousness program, he soon realized that his approval was essentially a matter of protocol. Teams already had all the information they needed to make informed decisions, but they still needed his signature to act – waiting for this approval just slowed things down. So, he initiated a practice called empowered execution, which allowed the teams themselves to handle situations that required immediate action. Empowered execution is simply the logical consequence of shared consciousness. However, it should be noted that empowering the teams to make decisions is the logical step after arming them with the information they need to make the decisions. Handing over control and power to a team that doesn’t have sufficient information could be disastrous. Companies would thus be well advised to ensure a strong structure and free flow of information before delegating decisions to lower-ranked team members. Without a shared consciousness, empowered execution is just irresponsible. But if your teams are empowered to act autonomously, why would they need a leader? Our final blink will reveal what the leader’s role in all of this is! If the team already has all the information and control they need to make effective, informed decisions, do they even need a leader? Yes, they do! But not a traditional leader. Rather, they need one who respects the team’s autonomy. Traditionally, leaders are viewed as commanders of an army, sitting in the background and barking orders to subordinates who dutifully carry out their tasks. Ultimately, the leaders are the ones who determine where everyone goes, what they do and by what means. Such an approach doesn’t take into account the amazing problem-solving power of a team of teams. What’s the point of having dynamic, highly functional teams who handle enormous amounts of information, and are capable of making great decisions, if they’re never allowed to act? Even in the rare instance where there’s enough time to consult a leader about their opinion, it would still be better to allow teams to make their own decisions. Not only is this more effective, but it also gets the team more invested in the execution of their plan. So what role does the modern leader play, then? Their job is essentially to make sure that the culture, the glue that holds these teams of teams together, stays intact. The leader’s role is different than that of a puppet master. In a team of teams, it’s the leader who sparks the conversations and makes sure everyone is participating in the discussion. She’s the person who makes sure that teams are empowered to make their own decisions, and that even the lowest-ranked operatives are also part of this empowered execution. In other words, the leader tends to the culture like a gardener would, while the team manages the day-to-day operations of the company. The key message in this book: Today’s complex world is highly unpredictable, and companies rely on the teamwork of those within their organization to make sense of this complexity. By organizing teams of teams, companies can turn their workforce into a single, highly adaptable working organism with a single vision.  Actionable advice: Use whiteboards. PowerPoint presentations have their place, but the best way to get your teams ready for innovation is much more low-tech: whiteboards. Displaying information in this way gives your team the means to brainstorm ideas dynamically, while making sure that they understand the complexity of the problems at hand.

Pretty much everyone has, at one time or another, been entrenched in a conflict with a troubled teen, a disenchanted spouse or a pestering neighbor. And, as you probably know, confronting the difficult person usually leads to all the blame being put on you. Truth be told, it’s difficult to sustain a conflict when one person chooses not to play along. So, if there are feuds or quarrels in your life, you’re at least partially responsible. But how can you pinpoint where your responsibility begins? And how can you remove yourself from conflict? That’s what these blinks are about. As you’ll find out, even your well-intentioned efforts – trying to help someone overcome a drug habit, for instance – can result in a never-ending cycle of reproach and resistance. The crucial part in this is your mindset or, more specifically, how you see and address people. This is good news, because your mindset is something that you can change. In these blinks, you’ll discover how the sultan Saladin won a war with a peaceful heart; what it means to be in an “I-deserve box” and why that’s a bad thing; and why your partner never does what you tell him or her to do. Let’s imagine that you were raised to fear and hate left-handed people, because two thousand years ago a group of left-handed people attacked your family’s right-handed ancestors.   But one day, you notice a man leaving a store that sells left-handed goods. As he’s in the middle of crossing the street, he falls and drops his bag, spilling his belongings. What do you do? There are basically two options: you can have a heart of peace or a heart of war. To have a heart of war is to see the person in need of help as inferior, or as an object rather than a human being, which is a sure way to perpetuate conflicts. Your inner-voice may tell you not to help him because you were taught that his people hate your people. But this frames him as only being part of a group or concept, rather than recognizing him as an individual. The heart of war suppresses our sense of compassion and urge to help; it’s the kind of mindset that creates and perpetuates hate, conflict and war. The better option is to have a heart of peace and listen to your sense of compassion – to see those around you as human beings. Even if you are forced into a war, you can still treat your opponent with compassion, which is what the sultan Saladin did in the twelfth century after the Crusaders massacred the people of Jerusalem. Eventually, Saladin’s Muslim army retook the city from the Christians, but he did not slaughter the innocent, as the Christians had a century before. He forbade his people to harm them, provided them with safe passage and even kept the city open to Christian pilgrims in the years that followed. This is what a heart of peace looks like: you choose compassion and treat others as human beings, burdened by their own fears and desires. Once this happens, others will be more likely to treat you the same way, increasing the likelihood of peace. No one enjoys getting into an argument with their spouse, child or coworker. Yet all too often we end up starting and restarting conflicts by engaging in the very behaviors that we don’t like.   This is what happens when we have a heart of war and see those around us as enemies. We go around thinking everyone is trying to cheat us or work against us – a mentality that inevitably leads to conflict. Making matters worse, this approach to life results in our attracting like-minded people who support our mentality, which only draws more people into the conflict. We can see this play out on the world stage as well, with groups of people being demonized and categorized as “others” who can only do harm. Many of these conflicts escalate to the point where solutions are virtually out of reach. Even when negotiations can be arranged, one nation will often believe that the talks were actually set up as a subversive trick. This is basically the situation that Israel and Palestine find themselves in. And when two people have a heart of war, it can result in collusion – when two conflicting parties inadvertently perpetuate the conflict. This happens when two people deny the fact that the other person can have a different yet equally valid perspective. Furthermore, they’ll refuse to admit that their assumptions may be wrong and insist that they’re always right. All of which means that negotiations, and any hope of finding common ground, are repeatedly crushed.   This happens in the home as well, when parents insist that they always know what’s best for their children. But let’s not forget that children are individuals with their own thoughts, just like anyone else. And they actually know a lot about their own needs, which we can learn about if we treat them respectfully and listen to their perspective. When was the last time someone said you did something wrong? How did you react?   Oftentimes, people will try to change a person when they find something wrong, but this only ends in further conflicts. Let’s say your partner hasn’t done his or her share of the chores in the past month. Your natural inclination is to say something about it, but that doesn’t mean you should try to force your partner to behave or think in a certain way. This will only be taken as criticism – something nobody likes. Indeed, criticizing usually only makes matters worse. Whether you realize it or not, your partner has a reason for thinking or behaving as he or she does. So try to listen to your partner, to relate to whatever he or she has to say about the issue at hand. Remember, we can’t force people to change, but we can create an environment that will invite them to change. Let’s take a more serious problem and say your partner is addicted to drugs or alcohol. Instead of trying to stop the behavior by force, you can improve a vital part of the environment by reaching out and being compassionate, which will strengthen your relationship. This will work far better than blaming or trying to change your partner, because now the drugs or alcohol won’t be used as a way to prove that you don’t have all the control. Once you move away from arguing about who’s right and who’s wrong, you can start listening to each other and find out what your partner needs to feel better. Similar situations can arise in the workplace when employees are discontent and unmotivated. This can happen when individuals are being isolated for praise or blame, which can divide people and create envy. Again, rather than trying to fix individuals, create a harmonious work environment and always listen to what your employees have to say. The human capacity for self-delusion is spectacular. How often have you convinced yourself that some hurtful actions were completely justified? One strategy that we use to justify our poor behavior, and to blind ourselves to the perspectives of others, is to create boxes for ourselves. One of the more popular boxes is the Better-than Box. This is built when we tell ourselves that we’re more special, gifted or talented than others. As a result, we’ll look at others as being “less-than” we are – less important, worthy or respectable. This outlook justifies our treating others poorly. Or we can put ourselves in the Victim Box, which works in the other direction, causing us to see everyone else as privileged and the world as a bad or unfair place. Since we have it so bad, we take it out on everyone else around us, and we’re justified because the world has shortchanged us and we deserve so much more than we get. Naturally, this can also be called the I-Deserve Box. Building a box not only justifies unpleasant behavior. It also prevents us from seeing anything other than our own perspective, which is how conflicts are created and perpetuated. But we can get out of these boxes and approach the situation in a new way. One of the best ways to escape the box is to think of these situations from the perspective of others. Does your behavior seem justifiable when you put yourself in the other person’s shoes? If you tend to treat the customers at your job with disrespect, just imagine going to a business and receiving the same service you provide. Once you step out of your box, you can start to see the world with some much needed perspective. In the end, whether you’re surrounded by war or peace depends on how you deal with situations and where your heart truly lies. If your life needs some change, the first step is to leave your box. Then you can start seeing the world with clear eyes and a heart full of peace. The key message in this book: Our normal approach to conflict is to fight for our position and correct the other person. But this doesn’t lead to peace and success; it only perpetuates the chance of further conflict. Instead, we have to change the state of our heart and how we view the people around us. The path to peace is to overcome the justifications we create for our poor behavior and to see others as individual human beings. Actionable advice: Get out of the Better-than Box! Sometimes we won’t help someone because we tell ourselves it wouldn’t be polite or we don’t want to create an embarrassing situation. But this can also be a different way of us staying in the Better-than Box and seeing the other person as a lesser-than who doesn’t deserve help. Don’t prevent yourself from humanizing those around you. Once you see others as people with feeling and emotions, you’ll be more willing to help, and it might be the event that changes their lives for the better. Got feedback?

If you do, then you may be in the minority. According to one study, 84 percent of all US workers feel disengaged, and that percentage has stayed more or less the same since 2002. Many companies don’t seem to be doing anything about this. Very few seriously consider ways to improve their working environment. They should. It is clear that a happy and more enthusiastic workforce will perform better, and customers will be happier as a result. These blinks help explain how businesses – both large and small – can make the positive changes to their environments, allowing staff to break the trend and start enjoying work. In these blinks you’ll discover how to exploit the power of napping; why staff hate sitting with their back to the room; and why winning an Oscar can prolong your life. What’s the best way for you as a workplace leader to manage the productivity of your staff? According to traditional thinking, productivity is best achieved when employees spend nearly all their time working as hard as possible. But although this old-fashioned approach was well-suited to the mechanical work that proliferated during the Industrial Revolution, today it’s seriously outdated. Instead, modern society’s most successful managers eschew the rigid nine-to-five formula, encouraging staff to carve out flexible work schedules. In other words, they let employees work when and where they feel most comfortable. For instance, old-fashioned managers might view napping as a waste of time. But in fact, napping is a great way for staff to keep their energy levels up for longer. (Of course, we’re talking about a 20-minute power-nap – not a long, deep sleep.) So to that end, a manager wanting to promote productivity might skip the new espresso machine and buy a cozy futon instead. Similarly, managers should create firm boundaries between work and home life. For example, Volkswagen and Daimler cut off e-mail access after business hours, allowing employees to recharge at night and be more productive during the day. Practices like these are sure to boost productivity, but if you really want to ensure that your employees achieve at the highest level, you also have to embrace failure. After all, no one can work at their full potential if they feel pressured to produce flawless work hour after hour. That’s simply too much stress! A stress-free environment isn’t the only advantage of embracing failure: This attitude will also promote experimentation, leading to a culture of innovation. To really understand the link between failure and innovation, consider this: The greatest inventions in human history followed repeated failure. Edison, for example, spent years trying and failing before he finally managed to invent the lightbulb. Imagine this scenario: Your boss expects you to come up with a creative solution by the end of the day. Working under pressure, you try as hard as you can, and yet the solution you’re looking for couldn’t be farther away. Unfortunately, this is an all-too-common workplace dilemma. Because after all, it’s hard to be creative when you’re under pressure. That’s why as a manager you should establish an environment that promotes play; this will take the pressure off and relax your staff, ultimately encouraging creativity. What’s the best way to do this? Well, you can start by freeing up your staff’s timetables and carving out space for games and athletic activity: For instance, your company can organize a running club or a football team. You can install some game consoles or simply buy a few board games. Although there are benefits to bringing actual games into the office, it’s also advantageous to incorporate the logic of play into your working processes. Think about it like this: One big reason games are so compelling is that they provide instant feedback. For instance, when you successfully play a video game, you’re instantly rewarded: You pass to ever-more advanced levels and secure high scores. Everyone likes this kind of recognition because, simply put, it makes us feel good about ourselves. And in fact, it can even make us healthier. Because believe it or not, studies have shown that Oscar-winning actors outlive mere nominees by an average of four years! Bearing that in mind, make sure that your staff’s hard work is noticed and recognized. And don’t rely on that old standby, the Employee of the Month Award, because recognizing one person at a time is too limited. Instead, take advantage of social media to call out great work and recognize each and every success, whenever it happens! Try to recall a childhood experience you loved wholeheartedly. Maybe it was a vacation at the beach, maybe it was a sporting event. Whatever it was, you probably get a warm feeling when you remember it. And it probably makes you feel more energetic. Well, companies should promote these kinds of positive emotions in their staff, as that will lead to increased productivity. There are many ways to do this: You can hold office events during holidays like Easter or Halloween, or you can organize sports teams and book clubs. These events needn’t be costly or grandiose. In fact, instead of focusing on extravagance, simply focus on frequency. That way, you can provide staff with many positive emotions and memories, large or small – ultimately creating a positive environment. Think it’s impossible to create a pleasant atmosphere at a boring old office? Well, think again: Any environment can be a positive one with just a few simple tweaks. For example, casinos are depressing because they aim to enable patrons to lose as much money as possible. However, if you swap out money for valueless plastic chips and offer free drinks, a casino becomes a fun, pleasant place. Of course, people can’t be happy all the time, because we all have a dark side. But that’s not a bad thing – embrace it! Think about it like this: When positive emotions are overly emphasized and negative emotions are disregarded, people stop thinking critically and become less receptive to substantive feedback. As a result, the whole company becomes more error-prone. It’s also worth noting that not every department requires the same level of positivity to promote good results. Because although an uplifting atmosphere benefits salespeople – who need positive energy to build successful relationships with clients – it would not necessarily benefit accountants, who need to be more meticulous with their work. Although it’s common knowledge that effective teamwork is an essential component of any company’s success, many managers mistakenly believe that friendship isn’t necessarily conducive to this kind of collaboration. But in fact, truly high-performing teams are made up of friends, not mere acquaintances. And there are many reasons that’s true. Friends are far less likely to let each other down, which means they support each other and deliver on their promises. From a business perspective, that means friendship-centric teams are less likely to fail. Friendship also negates loneliness. This is not a trivial point, as loneliness can have devastating effects on your body and your work. But unfortunately, loneliness is too common in many offices when employees feel alienated from their colleagues – the emotional equivalent of working in a cubicle. It does not promote happiness and productivity among staff. So what can you do to mitigate the negative effects of loneliness and cultivate friendship among your employees? Well, it helps to understand how people become friends in the first place, and that is through physical proximity, familiarity and by reaffirming similarity. In other words, people become friends when they work together on the same tasks again and again. You can make sure your workplace is conducive to this process by eliminating cubicles and any other barriers. Additionally, you can organize group activities like obstacle races or running competitions. Physical activities like these promote friendship by producing a rush of adrenaline, a powerful hormone that makes it easier to connect with those around you. Ultimately, an environment that supports friendship will help generate a communal feeling of pride in the organization itself. And when your team is proud of the work they do, they’ll be motivated to produce better work. Although looks aren’t everything, humans are visual creatures. So to that end, what does your workplace look like? Do you feel happy when you look around? Or do you feel depressed every time you step into the office? These are important questions to ask, but few companies bother. Most managers assume that a good employee can do the same good work anywhere. But this kind of thinking is seriously misguided. After all, just think how much more inspired you’d feel at the Sistine Chapel – with its majestic frescos and high ceilings – than in an office cubicle, with its dark, oppressive barriers. But unfortunately, too many offices are negligent on this point, settling for drab, badly designed spaces that depress workers and damage productivity. However, there are a few easy guidelines you can follow to improve your office space for the benefit of your employees. First, allow human evolution to guide your design process. So for instance, today we don’t like exposing our backs because the same position would have left our distant ancestors vulnerable to a predator attack. Therefore, to make your staff more comfortable, don’t make them sit with the back of their chairs facing the open room. Also, humans have an deep-seated love of nature, so make sure your office has lots of windows and that your staff can see outside. It’s also worth noting that no matter how well you design your office, the best way to make your staff comfortable is by letting them choose their own workplace. Optimally, employees should have a choice of working in three different rooms, as well as the option to work from home. In other words, create lots of alternatives and cede control to your employees. After all, creating a comfortable, pleasant environment will boost workplace productivity – so do your best to create an office people love. No matter how decisive and visionary you are as a leader, you also need to be a good communicator if you want to carry out your plans and ensure that your workplace operates smoothly. So how do you ensure that you’re a good communicator? The key is to listen and be nonjudgmental. And when it comes to listening, you need to be an active listener, which is all about showing the other person that you’re listening carefully, in order to build trust. To achieve this, maintain direct eye contact and make sure that your body language shows that you’re paying attention. Also, make sure you only speak half as much as the other person. And to stay nonjudgmental, keep your emotions in check. That way, any feedback you give won’t be taken personally. Being an active, nonjudgmental listener is an important part of being an effective leader, but it’s not the only thing: You also have to set a good example for your employees. After all, people naturally mimic their superiors. When we see success in other people, we automatically try to emulate it in order to become more successful ourselves. In other words, the way you conduct yourself as a leader will trickle down to employees. And in fact, studies have shown that CEOs who are naturally warm lead more cohesive teams; similarly, curious-minded CEOs tend to have flexible and risk-tolerant teams. This means you should take steps to ensure that you’re promoting good behavior. For example, behave calmly and never get angry, even when confronted with frustrating challenges. This will create an environment of trust, leading to a calm and happy staff. So now that we’ve discussed all the factors that make a workplace great, let’s talk about what you need to do to find the right people. How would you hire a new employee? Well, most of us create a job ad, wait for applications and then interview the candidates who have the best technical skills and experience. That’s the traditional recruiting process, and it’s pretty popular. However, it’s hardly ideal. After all, this process only targets job-seekers, narrowing your search to candidates who are unemployed or unhappy with their current jobs. Another problem with the traditional recruiting process is that it’s hard to get an accurate sense of candidates’ actual technical expertise from the interview alone. Because believe it or not, studies show that 81 percent of interviewees lie. Furthermore, it’s difficult to accurately gauge expertise because you, the interviewer, are probably biased. Even when you focus on evaluating technical skills, subconsciously you’re making your decision according to other factors. For instance, people who are tall and have deep voices are more likely to get hired, because interviewers connect these qualities with good health. Since there are many problems with the traditional recruiting process, you need to change your approach. We recommend getting creative with interviews and also giving your employees a larger role in the process. So when you need to make a new hire, rally your employees. Let them ask around and tap their own networks. This way, you stand a better chance of finding great employees outside the basic applicant pool. And then, once you have your candidates, introduce creativity into the interview process. To avoid the lies, avoid questions relating to technical expertise. Instead, ask questions to determine whether candidates would fit in with your team. For example, while interviewed for a job, the author’s wife had to answer the question, “If you could be any fabric, what fabric would you be?” She answered velvet, because that fabric is warm on the inside and smooth on the outside. Ultimately, this answer showed her interviewer that she was a team player – and she got the job! The key message in this book: Every workplace can improve – and as a leader, you can change yours for the better. All it takes is a willingness to prioritize your employees’ happiness and well-being. You have to be seriously committed in order to create a more positive environment, but it will be well worth it, leading to increased productivity and better results.  Actionable advice: Encourage your staff to take breaks, naps and sometimes work from home.  Although some people fear that these practices only waste time, creating a more flexible approach to scheduling and workspace will lead to better productivity.

Even the most brilliant geniuses among us need a helping hand now and then to get their ideas off the ground. But pulling together to achieve a common aim isn’t as easy as it looks on paper. Whether it’s in the office or on the sports field, a dysfunctional group dynamic can quickly sour the atmosphere and lead to all manner of infighting. So what makes a team more than the sum of its parts? Drawing on evidence ranging from a study of kindergartners building a spaghetti tower, to the way today’s most successful companies run their workplaces, Daniel Coyle’s The Culture Code explores the importance of the way we interact with our teammates, while providing plenty of tips on how to avoid inadvertently throwing a wrench into the works. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a group of children can easily beat lawyers in a simple teamwork exercise; what makes us feel safe and why that matters; and why stories are so effective when it comes to establishing a shared sense of purpose. Whether it’s a family, a circle of friends or work colleagues, we’re all members of different groups. And big or small, every group has its own distinctive culture. So what’s a group culture? In essence, it’s the relationships between people working together to achieve a common aim. Not all group cultures are alike, though. Some work well, while others are dysfunctional. You can spot a poor group culture a mile off. If you’ve ever worked in an office or lived in a house with a defective group culture, you’ll know the atmosphere is so thick and tense that you could cut it with a knife. That’s often the result of group members focusing on the wrong thing. Rather than paying attention to the quality of their interactions, they struggle to determine their position within the group and spend time worrying about their own status. As soon as you start doing that, you’re no longer focused on the work at hand; everything becomes a question of whose ideas can be criticized and which rules are open for debate. That’s a recipe for disaster. Take a study carried out by engineer Peter Skillman. He asked groups of kindergartners, business school students and lawyers to take part in a simple competition. The aim of the exercise was to build the tallest possible structure using uncooked spaghetti, tape, a yard of string and a single marshmallow. If you were the betting type, you’d surely put your money on the students or lawyers, right? After all, they’re the ones with the most expertise, experience and general knowledge. As it turned out, it was the kindergartners who usually won. So how did they prevail over their older and presumably wiser competitors? The answer lies in group dynamics. The business school students, for example, always began by analyzing the task at hand, discussing the right strategy to follow and quietly establishing a hierarchy. The kindergartners pursued a radically different approach. Rather than trying to figure out who was responsible for what, they simply got on with the task. Hardly wasting a word, they huddled together and started experimenting. If one attempt failed, they tried something else. They ended up winning the competition because they were focused on interaction; they were cooperating to achieve a shared goal rather than competing amongst themselves. So how can you make your groups more like that of the kindergartners? In the following blinks, we’ll delve deeper into the question of group culture to find out. Imagine you’ve been assigned a complex task demanding every ounce of your skill and expertise. You’re given two choices as to where to work: your own home or a room full of complete strangers. In which setting would you be more likely to succeed? Most of us wouldn’t hesitate – of course, it’d be much easier in your own home, right? It’s a safe environment, and the same principle applies to groups. A group performs at a much higher level if each of its members feels safe. It’s worth thinking about the concept of safety a little. What is it and why is it so important? Safety is ultimately about a sense of familiarity and connections. When we feel safe, we know that there aren’t unseen dangers lurking around every corner. A strong group culture nurtures that sense, and that, in turn, boosts individual performance. Take a study conducted by Will Felps, an associate professor at the University of South Wales. Felps instructed a man called Nick to assume different roles among various groups that had been tasked with developing a marketing plan for a company. Taking on the guise of an obnoxious idler, Nick would slack off and obstruct the progress of the group’s work. In most cases, his behavior was contagious: those around him mirrored his attitude and started behaving in the same way. Only one group proved immune to this behavior. This was a group in which one of the members – Jonathan – consistently countered Nick’s bad attitude with warmth and positivity. By making those around him feel safe and comfortable, he helped the group perform well despite the presence of a “bad apple” among them. This finding underscores an important point: we perform best when we receive belonging cues that bolster our perceptions of safety. Further proof of this can be found in another study of group performance by professor Alex “Sandy” Pentland at the MIT Media Lab. Pentland had two groups of students play the roles of bosses and employees engaged in negotiations about salary, health benefits and vacations. Pentland then used a so-called sociometer – a data-collecting sensor programmed to pick up belonging cues like eye contact, mimicry and physical proximity – to analyze the negotiations. Paying attention to these cues allowed Pentland to gauge the sense of safety of the participants. Our brains are wired to be constantly alert and on the lookout for signs of danger, so these behavioral traits are a good indication of when we feel safe in our environment. Pentland discovered that he could predict the outcome of the bargaining sessions just by looking at the first five minutes of the data he had gathered. It was the interaction that determined the outcome, not what was being said. So we know that the success of groups depends on making everyone feel safe. But creating a safe environment isn’t something that can be picked up from a book. Like honing your soccer skills, it’s something that takes time and practice. That said, there are a few tips that might help you along the way. If you want to create a safe working environment, it’s essential that you let the people around you know that you’re listening to what they have to say. Take an insight developed by Ben Waber, the founder of the behavior consultancy firm Humanyze. Whenever he visits companies or organizations with a successful group culture, he invariably sees the same things. People show that they’re listening to each other; they tilt their heads toward the speaker, raise their eyebrows and hardly blink. They also use linguistic markers to show that they’re paying attention, interjecting words of affirmation like “uh-huh,” “right,” “yes” and so on. It’s a simple and effective way of making people feel safe. Try it out sometime! Interjecting occasionally to show you’re following someone’s train of thought isn’t the same as interrupting them, however. Great listeners know when to hold back. That’s important because interruptions disturb the smooth flow of interactions that foster a sense of belonging and safety. Waber also noticed this when he was looking at group dynamics. Salespeople who interrupted their potential buyers, for example, weren’t nearly as successful as those who spent more time listening to them. Another top tip is to let people see your weaknesses. Demonstrating that you’re aware of your own imperfections and admitting that you also make mistakes early on in an interaction lays a foundation for a feeling of safety. That’s not an easy thing to admit to, of course. Usually, we’re determined to dazzle others with our competence – but that just isn’t the best way to put others at ease. A much more effective strategy is to make others feel like you need their help. This can be as simple as using a phrase that invites input like “I might be wrong, of course,” “did I miss anything?” or asking someone what they think. So that’s the first key skill you need in order to create a safe environment. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at a second, essential strategy. Take a moment to think about how you interact with others. Have you ever exaggerated your own know-how and gone to great lengths to demonstrate your competence? If that sounds familiar, you should stop! While it might sound counterintuitive, sharing your vulnerabilities is essential to boosting group performance. But how does this work? Mirroring is a common dynamic in groups. We pick up on the way those around us behave and take up the same patterns. Admitting weaknesses and mistakes signals to other group members that they can do the same. That’s a great way to build trust. Jeff Polzer, a professor in organizational behavior at Harvard, calls this a vulnerability loop. This essentially refers to a feedback loop between the members of a group, which generates the sense of closeness essential to cohesive group performance. A dramatic example of this occurred during a plane crash in 1989. A domestic flight to Chicago piloted by Al Haynes suddenly ran into drastic problems when an engine exploded mid-flight. Haynes then made a decision that ended up saving just under 200 lives. Instead of trying to resolve the issue by himself, he told his colleagues that he needed their help. By admitting his vulnerability, he allowed the other crew members to also ask for help. Once they started doing that, they began working together to regain control of the plane. The plane eventually crashed and 100 people were killed, but there were also 185 survivors, which was something close to a miracle. When the incident was later recreated in simulations, it was impossible to achieve the same outcome – every simulated flight resulted in the deaths of all passengers and crew. This close connection between admitting vulnerabilities and cooperation has been confirmed by several other studies. Take an experiment conducted by psychology professor David DeSteno. The participants in the study were asked to complete a time-consuming and laborious task on a computer. As they neared completion of the task, the computers would suddenly – and seemingly spontaneously – crash. DeSteno had planted an assistant amongst the group. When the computers crashed, he would come to the rescue of the participants and restore the work they’d just lost. Later, while playing a specially designed game, the participants showed a much greater willingness to cooperate both with their rescuer and the other computer users, despite the fact that they remained complete strangers to one another. This was because they had experienced a moment of vulnerability and had then been “rescued,” a series of events that had resulted in a sense of trust and safety. So how do you go about building a strong team? A good place to start is to communicate your expectation that people should cooperate with each other. To say that you want to cooperate with someone is another way of saying that you need their help – which is also a way of sharing your vulnerabilities. When you let people know that you’re reliant on their help, it lets them know that they can also feel comfortable admitting their shortcomings. It creates an environment in which no one is expected to go it alone and manage everything by themselves. It’s a nifty trick that’s been put into action by Tim Brown, the head of the international innovation consultancy agency IDEO. At the start of each assignment, he’s explicit about the need for cooperation and tells his colleagues that the trickier the problem, the greater the need will be for the team to work together to develop solutions. That philosophy of cooperation is at the heart of IDEO’s success. That might leave you wondering about the role of leaders in all this. The answer is in the word itself: their task is to lead. And that means being the first to walk the plank and admit their vulnerabilities. You can see why this is so important by imagining an office meeting with both your colleagues and your managers. It’s unfortunately common for the former to “fear” the latter, as they’re worried about keeping up appearances and demonstrating their knowledge and competency. But it’s normal to make mistakes – we all make them! They’re a part of the learning process, which is why leaders need to be role models and lead the way. By admitting their vulnerabilities and imperfections, they help foster an open environment in which everyone can admit mistakes and work with others on solutions. Take the example of the successful American restaurateur Danny Meyer. The morning after he’d given a TED Talk, he held a staff meeting and watched the footage of the talk with his employees. After they’d seen the video, Meyer asked them for their feedback and shared his experiences. He told them how nervous he’d been, how much his legs had been shaking and how badly he’d messed up the rehearsal. Finally, he thanked two colleagues and told them that he wouldn’t have been able to give the talk at all without their help. This is a great way to lead by example. By sharing his vulnerabilities in such a candid manner, Meyer created a working environment in which every employee felt free to do the same. If you’ve ever played or even just watched a team sport like soccer or basketball, you’ll know that the teams that regularly put in a great performance share a strong vision of how to play together and what they want to achieve. That’s because a common sense of purpose is key to group performance. Let’s pause for a second to define that. A sense of purpose is simply a set of beliefs and values underpinning people’s actions. It’s what shapes a group’s identity and tells others what it stands for. Cooperative cultures can’t do without it. A shared sense of purpose provides group members with a common stock of ideas and aligns their behavior. Because a shared sense of purpose is so important to group cohesion and performance, companies often try to create high-purpose environments. This is a way of guiding action around a repeatable purpose that’s always at the front of group members’ minds. High-purpose environments are packed with signals connecting members of the group to a shared future goal. Think of it like a bridge spanning the present and the future. Before setting foot on the bridge, the members of the group are confronted with a sign saying, “This is where we are today, and this is where we’ll be tomorrow!” Psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen has demonstrated in several studies that communicating common goals, like “Customer safety is our first priority,” helps unite the members of a group while making their shared aim accessible. “Bridges” are like stories with a distinctive narrative arc. This is an important factor because our minds are highly receptive to storytelling, and data from brain scans consistently proves it. When we’re confronted with a simple fact, our brains are fairly inactive; at most, we grasp the meaning of the fact. Stories, on the other hand, actively engage our minds – we can’t help but start thinking about cause and effect as well as the greater meaning of the story. That makes storytelling a powerful spur to action. It motivates us to pursue a common goal like, for example, putting customer safety first. Establishing a sense of purpose isn’t something you can do overnight; it’s not as simple as carving a mission statement into a block of granite and putting it outside the company headquarters. So take your time, as it’s a process that involves failures and learning from past mistakes. Even so, there are a few tips that can help you along the way. Repetition is integral to a shared sense of purpose. And repetition really does mean repetition. You should be blue in the face once you’re done extolling your company’s core convictions! Because we know what we mean when we say something, we often assume that our priorities have been communicated to others – but they’re often about as clear as mud. That’s why you shouldn’t be shy about repeating yourself; if you want something to be clear, say it ten times over. To get a sense of why this is so important, take a survey by Inc. magazine that asked managers how many people in their firms knew what the company’s top priorities were. The average among the executives’ answers was 64 percent. When the magazine asked the employees, however, it soon became clear that the actual number was only 2 percent! A clever way of boosting awareness is by overcommunicating your company’s sense of purpose in regular meetings. This is especially effective when you invite people to actively engage and encourage them to reflect on and even challenge the company’s goals. That’s something that the American healthcare company Johnson & Johnson does to great effect. They hold frequent meetings with senior managers designed to encourage robust discussion of the company’s credo – conveniently enough, it’s also carved in granite just outside the building where the meetings take place. Johnson & Johnson’s core aims haven’t changed much as a result, but it does encourage active engagement with their priorities. Another effective way of establishing a common sense of purpose is to use short and snappy catchphrases. These can be corny, of course, but that doesn’t mean that they’re not effective. Think, for example, of online shoe and clothing company Zappos’s memorable slogan “Create fun and a little weirdness,” or consulting firm IDEO’s “Talk less, do more.” Cheesy or not, they’re useful reminders of what a company stands for. So embrace them! The key message in this book: Group dynamics determine outcomes. When a team focuses its attention on the wrong thing, it loses sight of what’s most important to its performance – the interactions of its members. But a healthy and productive group dynamic is possible. The best way of achieving it is to create a safe environment in which everyone can share their vulnerabilities. When you add a common sense of purpose into the mix, you’ve got the perfect recipe for success! Actionable advice: Learn how to be a great listener. Whether it’s your family, local soccer team or workplace, chances are that you’re part of at least one group. So how do you go about contributing to its success? Your individual performance is essential, of course – but you shouldn’t forget about working to create a healthy group dynamic. Openness and attention to detail are key, which means not only listening to what other members have to say but also showing that you’re listening. And when it’s your turn to speak your mind, make sure to invite others to participate and share their feedback. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Chris Edmonds","summary":"Nowadays, culture has become a mystical and elusive ideal for all organizations. Fix your culture and all will turn to gold! Of course, you can’t just snap your fingers and overhaul your organization’s culture from one moment to the next, but when you consider companies like Zappos, it’s clearly a goal worth pursuing. After all, Amazon paid big bucks for Zappos, and it’s no secret that part of what they were buying was Zappos’s unique culture. As you’ll see in these blinks, research backs up the importance of organizational culture: Great company culture helps companies last longer and be more successful. It makes for more engaged employees, more loyal customers and more creative offices. So how do you start transforming your culture? Read these blinks to find out. In these blinks, you’ll learn why Zappos pays new hires to quit; how a mission statement can help you outlast your competitors; and a five-step method for addressing people who resist the new culture. Want to revolutionize your work culture and transform your business? Start by writing an organizational constitution – a formal document that sets out the core principles of your company or team. Here’s how it works: Organizational constitutions lay out specific rights for employees and standards for them to follow. Think of it like the rules of the road, guidelines you use to navigate an ambiguous situation and govern your behavior. For instance, when arguing with a colleague, it’s easy to go too far and insult them. But if your organizational constitution includes a zero-tolerance policy for rude conduct between co-workers, you would likely choose your words more carefully. But an organizational constitution should also answer important questions: What are our company goals? What performance targets can help us meet them? And what are our standards for how we treat each other? For example, when Tony Hsieh founded the online shoe store Zappos, his intention was for the company to have a fun, familial atmosphere. To facilitate this, he defined ten values that would form the basis of the company culture. Here’s why an organizational constitution is essential for your business: Without an agreement to guide it, your company will struggle to develop a good work culture, and your organization’s culture has a huge impact on its success. Take Zappos’ renowned customer service. Since Zappos’ employees like their jobs, they’re full of enthusiasm, which they then pass on to their customers. The customers then associate this enthusiasm with Zappos, which is a big plus for the company. In fact, Amazon cited Zappos’ great office culture as a major incentive for purchasing the company in 2009. Zappos owes their culture to their constitution, because when there’s a formal agreement governing how people are treated, everyone feels safe, respected and engaged with their work. And engaged employees are better employees: a 2013 Gallup study found that engaged workers are more productive, with less turnover, fewer accidents and better customer satisfaction. When designing the rules that’ll govern your organization, it’s important to first decide the values you’ll hold yourself to. Inspiring a culture as revolutionary as Zappos’s also means looking at your own capabilities. Remember, as a leader, all eyes are on you. You need to be a living example of the rules that guide your company and its culture. Everything the person in charge does affects the team culture for better or worse. How? Well, if your behavior varies, or if you contradict the organizational constitution, your employees might think that you’re not truly invested in changing the culture, and that your shallow, short-lived attempt to do so is now over. For instance, if you fail to reprimand people who break the rules set out in the organizational constitution, your employees won’t take it seriously. And what kind of message would it send to, say, give a speech about respecting your colleagues one day, and then to honk aggressively at an employee in the parking lot the next? So, living by your organization’s constitution is essential to changing its culture. To do so, you’ll need to have a personal constitution, that is, a personal statement comprising four values, and four behaviors that correspond to those values. Start with your purpose. Think of it as your foundation, your personal mission statement. For example, the author’s purpose is to push workplace leaders to foster inspiration and discover their own values. Next, search for your values and the behaviors that reflect them. To find your values, think about what you’re proud to be known for, things like wonder, stability, creativity and so on. Then, assign a clear and measurable behavior to each value. For instance, if you choose “wonder” as a value, a corresponding behavior might be to read at least two books a month or to ask more questions. Now that you’ve got your personal constitution, give it a leadership philosophy: something that describes how you believe people should be led and motivated! Now that you’ve written your personal constitution, use the same techniques to write your organizational constitution. Start with your organization’s purpose statement, then define its values and assign each value a behavior that will help put it into practice. When writing your company’s purpose statement, make it captivating and inspiring, but also be sure to explain what your company does, for whom and why. Remember, this will be the mission statement for your organization. Make your purpose statement even better by learning from others’ mistakes: Avoid saying that the only purpose of your company is to make money, or simply describing what products or services you offer. For your purpose statement to work, it needs to be memorable and inspiring for your customers and employees alike. Take this example purpose statement: To help save trees – one person and one water bottle at a time. Why does it work? It immediately gives you the company’s reason for existing: to make water bottles while aiding the environment. Don’t doubt the importance of your purpose statement; a 2001 study found that purpose statements are an important factor in a company’s long-term survival. Once you have your purpose statement, it’s time to decide on your values and behaviors. Now that you know how to choose personal values, the next step is to figure out what your company’s values are and define them as specifically as possible. For instance, if your two values are excellence and respect, you could say that excellence means going beyond the expectations of your customers, while respect means being considerate to everyone, both inside and outside the company. Once you’ve defined your values, you can assign them behaviors that will make them a reality. For the value of excellence, you could be sure to embrace feedback and know everything about your business. Likewise, behaviors that reflect respect might include choosing your words carefully and encouraging employees to give each other honest praise. But don’t get too carried away. When setting your values and corresponding behaviors, try to keep the list to between three and five of each. So, you’ve designed your organizational constitution and are excited to revolutionize your company culture, but when you introduce your ideas they’re met with some resistance. How can you handle employees who don’t support your approach? Start by understanding that resistance comes in many forms.   The first opposition will probably come from the leaders of your organization, like managers and supervisors. After all, they’re the first ones you’ll ask to embrace the new company culture. They’re likely to express their resistance in one of two ways: One possibility is that they won’t walk the walk, meaning that although they promise to adopt the new practices, their behavior will suggest otherwise and they won’t become the ideal example you need. Or, they’ll actively oppose the initiative by disregarding it or voicing complaints about the organizational constitution, claiming that it’s a waste of time. Don’t panic, dealing with resistant leaders is easy: First of all, don’t take it personally. Naturally you’ll be upset, but take a deep breath and remember that they’re not opposing you, they’re opposing a change to their habits. Once you’ve calmed down, explain the issues with your resistant employee’s behavior as non-judgmentally as possible. This will show him that you’ve noted the problems and that they need to change. When confronting your employee, you should only discuss their clear, observable behavior, and not the beliefs or motivations behind it. Now that you’ve told the employee how you perceive his behavior, give him a chance to voice his problems with the organizational constitution. It’s important that you work to understand his perspective, even if you disagree with it. After hearing his stance, don’t budge. Explain to your employee that this is non-negotiable; every leader must be in line with the values of the company. Once your employee has heard your needs, give him a chance to change his behavior. If he doesn’t, he needs to be let go. Now that your organization has adopted its constitution, there’s still one last hurdle to clear. It’s essential that all new employees are in line with the company’s stated values. Why? Because hiring just one person who’s against the organizational culture could unravel all the hard work you’ve invested. It’s important to attract the right people. Say you hire a new manager with great experience and the right skills. If he rejects the organizational constitution, your employees will assume that you don’t care about it either. Pretty soon, this new manager will erode the trust and engagement between your employees that you have worked hard to foster. So, instead of looking for the most skilled people, look for the ones with both the right skills and the right commitment to your organization’s mission. How? Ensure prospective candidates understand your organizational culture. Make this information available by including your company’s purpose, values and expectations for behavior in every job posting you make! This way you can be sure to attract only people who share your values. But hiring the right people won’t matter if they don’t adjust to your culture. So make sure to take the time and effort necessary to integrate new hires. When taking new employees on board, make sure they experience cultural exposure, an explicit educational session on your organizational culture. Explain the expected behavior and praise new hires when they display it. Another way to orientate new employees is through a mentor, ideally someone other than the employee’s supervisor. The mentor and employee should meet every couple of weeks for the first few months to talk about whatever the new employee wants. The topic of conversation isn’t limited to issues that HR can resolve, but can be about anything work-related. The mentor-mentee relationship is productive because the mentor can answer questions the new employee might be scared to ask publicly, while showing him how to abide by the organization’s purpose, values and behavior. The key message in this book: The culture of a company is one of its most valuable attributes, but building a culture that an entire organization can embrace is no simple task. Using an organizational constitution to formally outline an entity’s purpose, values and associated behaviors can provide a clear and organized format for any group to rally around.

No matter your calling in life, there’s a good chance you’ll hit a rough patch where things aren’t going as planned and progress is at a frustrating standstill. Many of us have watched as colleagues get promoted ahead of us, sales figures plateau, relationships grow cold or felt like our work is getting worse rather than better. In the words of author Seth Godin, this difficult time is known as the Dip, and it can be found in just about every facet of life. But don’t despair! Even though the Dip is virtually unavoidable, there is often light at the end of the tunnel. Those who show patience and determination will be rewarded when growing pains come to an end and promotions, customers and relationships take a turn for the better. As Godin points out, the Dip is just a natural progression for any endeavor and by being prepared for it, you’ll be better suited to succeed. In these blinks you’ll find out how the Dip can be used as a helpful tool; how the Dip has benefitted giants like Microsoft; and why you should stop worrying and learn to love the Dip. Let’s say you want to master figure skating. Learning how to gracefully glide across the ice, and even skate backward, can happen pretty quickly. But learning how to land a perfect quadruple jump will take a great deal of time and strenuous effort before you can perfect it. This is the time when you’re struggling – deep in the Dip. The same experience can happen when you’re bringing a new business to life. At first it’ll be smooth sailing as you fall in love with your exciting and innovative ideas. But then there’s the inevitable mountains of paperwork to overcome and figuring out how to solve the many problems that will arise during the early stages. Chances are, it’ll be years before the Dip is over and you’re comfortably running a successful business. Sometimes the Dip can be purposefully built-in to a process as a way of finding out who the most dedicated and hardworking people are. Imagine you’re a student in the US, thinking of going to medical school. One of your mandatory classes in the first year will be Organic Chemistry – a fiendishly difficult subject that will eat up a great deal of your study time. While Organic Chemistry isn’t the most important class in the curriculum, it creates a Dip that causes many students to throw in the towel early on. A lot of people entertain the idea of becoming a doctor, so creating a Dip early on is an easy way for universities to reduce the class size to only the most dedicated students. A similar strategy is used in the hiring processes of companies around the world. In order to whittle down the applicant pool to only the best talents, many job applications require an excessive amount of documentation and include multiple rounds of stressful interviews. The good news is, by recognizing these Dips for what they are, you can find comfort in the knowledge that they’re supposed to be difficult and that it will get easier if you just stick with it. When you were growing up, there’s a very good chance you were taught to have modest, realistic goals rather than bold, grand ambitions. The truth is that if you aim for being the best at what you do, the rewards can be phenomenal. Take ice-cream flavors, for example: coming in at number one is vanilla, which accounts for 30 percent of all ice cream sales in the US. Meanwhile, chocolate comes in at second, but only accounts for 10 percent of the sales. That’s a huge difference between the best and second-best – and this phenomenon applies to more than just snack foods. According to Zipf’s law, a significant gap between first and second place can be found everywhere, from record sales to the top colleges. Naturally, Zipf’s law also means that being number one comes with huge profits, but there are also less obvious perks to being the very best at what you do. One such advantage is the word-of-mouth boost known as the snowball effect. Imagine being in a foreign city and wanting to find a decent place to eat. If you ask a local, you’ll likely get pointed toward whatever restaurant is the number one local favorite. So, if you’re the owner of that establishment, you’re all but guaranteed to have those hungry travelers regularly showing up thanks to all that free word-of-mouth promotion. Another perk is related to how much you can charge. Since being the best is such a rarefied thing that sets you far apart from anyone else, you’re free to charge more for your premium product or service. This applies to just about everything, whether it’s about popular actors, musicians, hotels, restaurants, food brands or manufacturers – it pays to be the best. The average grade school experience is about getting an all-around general education, with rewards tending to go to the students who get good marks in every subject. But in the post-school world, being good at everything isn’t as important as being at the top of your class in one important subject. In other words, success is about specializing in something. Specificity has many advantages. For starters, some people aren’t sure about what career to pursue. But if you’re lucky enough to already have a specific skill that you excel at, this can make career decisions much easier. Even if you’ve already begun a career, you should know that customers aren’t interested in average – they want exceptional, and providing world-class service is just another form of specialization. If you’re an accountant, your customers aren’t going to care if you’re an amazing golfer or a virtuoso at playing the guitar. The only thing that matters is that you’re the best accountant they can get. An important part of specializing is learning how to strategically quit the things that get in the way of you being the best at what you do. However, most people have been taught that quitting is wrong, and that they should stick with any project they’ve started and never give up. Unfortunately, people can’t be truly exceptional and the best at a wide range of things. Instead, people need to make distinct choices, which means quitting intensive pursuits that aren’t related to your central focus. For example, let’s say you have a passion to produce the world’s first flying car, but you also want to play trumpet in an innovative jazz band and start a non-profit that promotes the use of eco-friendly green energy. All of your interests may be worthwhile, but it just isn’t feasible to do it all and be the best at everything. The better strategy is to make the clear choice of focusing on the one project that you’ve got the skills for and feel most passionate about. But as we’ll find out in the next blink, even if you’ve chosen wisely, you can still end up in the Dip. Fortunately, you can have the advantage of knowing exactly what to expect. As the saying goes, “knowing is half the battle.” And knowing that a Dip is on the way is an important insight that gives you time to plan ahead and to familiarize yourself with what your particular Dip will look like. Since every type of business has its own Dip, let’s take a look at some of the most common ones, starting with manufacturing. If you have a passion for manufacturing, you may have already enjoyed the thrill of building something in your garage. But if you’re hoping to take things to the next level, it’s going to require substantial investments in technology and tools. You may also need to invest in learning new skills, like how to create an integrated electric circuit. So, in this case, the Dip is going to be the amount of time, effort and money it takes to transition from the garage to a professional production operation. It will involve the lengthy and unpleasant business of raising funds, finding partners, creating a production line and securing your first clients. And during each step of this slow and frustrating process, it will be tempting to call it quits, so it’s important to remember that the Dip will end as long as you persevere. If your business is in sales, you’ll find that coming up with a good idea and getting investors on board might be the easy part. The Dip happens afterward, when you’re trying to expand your business and build an effective sales force. This is when the dreary business of recruiting and onboarding new employees begins, since it requires the tedious work of setting up everyday operational structures and ensuring legal compliance. It’s also worth knowing when the Dip arrives in personal projects too. Let’s say you want to learn Chinese. At first you’ll be intrigued by the unusual characters and their meanings and fascinated by the new sounds as they take on new meanings for you. But it won’t take long before these initial pleasures give way to the Dip, which will take months or years of hard work to overcome and get to the point where you’re speaking the language fluently. And then there’s the dreaded relationship Dip. It follows the honeymoon period, and is characterized by the new couple engaging in everyday squabbles as they try to cement their relationship and commitment while fighting off boredom. If it wasn’t for the unpredictable nature of the wind, windsurfing would probably be pretty easy. In fact, many people are drawn to windsurfing and experience an initial thrill, but then end up cursing the wind and giving up what at first seems like a fun hobby. But despite the difficulties it may occasionally bring, you obviously can’t windsurf without wind! In fact, the wind is the best part, which brings us to the key in withstanding the Dip: embracing the challenge. Ultimately, whatever your project is, the sensible thing to do is to welcome the challenges it presents and be thankful for them rather than trying to resist them. Indeed, finding ways to overcome challenges is what makes an activity stimulating and rewarding. Think about it: if windsurfing was so easy that anyone could do it, it would probably be boring. The point of taking on any job is to meet and overcome challenges. For example, if you were to work at a retail store and only ring up the items being purchased, there would be little challenge and you would be easily replaceable. But if you also help the customers, especially the really difficult ones, and take care of their needs, you will show that you’ve got skills that are less easy to replace. Taking on challenges is the very essence of growth and development. So if you really push yourself to your limits, you will not only survive, but thrive in the Dip. Take exercise, for instance. If you wish to have a good physique, it will take entering the Dip purposefully and pushing yourself to the limits. However, many people will stop too early; they’ll reach a certain comfort level and not press any further. If you hope to truly develop muscle, you’ll have to push to the point of exhaustion. Only those who push beyond their limits each and every time will be able to achieve a bodybuilder’s physique. The same is true of any endeavor, whether it’s mental or physical. Competition is rarely a pleasant business. Dealings with competitors can be full of treachery and resentment. Often, one of the primary motivations of a competitor is to lengthen your time in the Dip. Specifically, an established competitor will create a marketplace that makes it very hard for you to gain a foothold. The tech giant Microsoft, for example, turned programs like Word and Excel into industry standards. As a result, the market for word processing and spreadsheet software has been virtually impregnable. Given how extremely hard it is for a rival to catch up, they’ve effectively put any potential competitor into a prolonged Dip. Nevertheless, it isn’t impossible. A company called Intuit released the accounting software Quicken and since it was an innovative product comparable to Microsoft’s, they were able to persevere, highlighting the quality and security their program offered. Competitors have also succeeded in changing the platform on which the services are offered. In order to successfully compete with Microsoft, Google has focused on web-based word processing and spreadsheet services that are built-in to a customer’s Google account. Another benefit of sticking with it and challenging yourself to get through the Dip is that it will keep you from settling for mediocrity. While there’s nothing wrong with settling for a job as a cashier in a quaint suburban shop, there’s a good chance this won’t help you to reach your full potential. On the other hand, persevering through the Dip can bring out the best in you and even make you more talented than when you started. For example, if your new online photography blog doesn’t catch on right away, you can use this Dip time to sharpen your writing, photography and web design skills and make your online destination more attractive. This way, even if your blog never catches on as you’d hoped, you’ll have gained valuable skills that can be put to use on your next online project. If you’ve ever been stuck in a long line at the supermarket, you know how tempting it can be to switch to another checkout lane in the hopes of getting out a little bit quicker. But there’s always a chance that once you switch to the other line, that first one will start to speed up and you’ll end up waiting longer than you would have in the first place! This supermarket scenario can be applied to careers and personal projects too. If something seems to be slowing down or stalled, you may be tempted to move everything over to a new endeavor – but what’s really needed is patience and grit, otherwise known as determination. This is certainly true for sales: In one influential study, researchers found that if a salesperson can’t convince a customer to buy after five sales pitches, they’ll give up on them. However, the study also showed that 80 percent of customers were more likely to make a purchase after hearing seven sales pitches. Therefore, most of the salespeople were calling it quits too early. If they’d just shown a bit more grit and patience they might have sealed the deal. Patience and determination is also needed for surviving the Dip time before your product catches on. You may think that we’re living in a time where people are quick to buy whatever the latest innovative product is, but that’s not always the case. Even if you have a clever idea or a game-changing product, the general public always wait for new things to be regarded as high quality, reliable or prestigious before they even consider parting with their hard-earned money. As a result, even ingenious ideas can spend a long time in the Dip before they become popular. A good example is the shoemaker Jimmy Choo. Born in 1948, Choo had been making quality shoes since he was 11 years old. But his career didn’t take off until he was in his late thirties, a couple of years after he moved from Malaysia to London and opened his first American shoe store in 1986. While he was always a talented craftsman, it was his grit and perseverance through the Dip that really allowed him to become an iconic international fashion brand. While it’s undoubtedly beneficial to have grit, it’s nevertheless wise to know when to cut your losses and quit a project that’s clearly falling apart. But there’s also a smart way to both quit and simultaneously stick with your chosen field. When something is clearly not working, there’s no sense in letting it continue to drain your time, energy and resources. But that doesn’t mean you should quit the market that you’ve grown familiar with and gained experience within. Doing so would just be yet another waste of your time, energy and resources. Let’s say you’ve decided to shut down a magazine that was no longer financially feasible. You may be so heartbroken over the magazine’s demise that you want to abandon the publishing world altogether and start a restaurant. But the smart plan would be to stay in the media market and use the experience you’ve gained to become an editor for someone else’s magazine or newspaper, or perhaps start an online publication. The next time you feel like quitting, make sure you consider all your options before throwing in the towel. It’s best to take the time to think creatively – beyond all the obvious choices. David is a friend of the author, and at one point he was so unhappy at work he felt like quitting. The problem was that his boss was so incompetent that he was making it impossible for David to produce good work and feel satisfied about his job. David’s frustrations finally reached the point where he wanted to hand in his resignation. But instead of overreacting, he wisely took the time to consider all the other options at his disposal. In the end, he had productive conversations with his boss as well as his boss’s superior. David was candid in explaining the reasons why he felt unable to contribute his best work under the current circumstances. As a result, David was transferred to another department where he was given a new boss and a promotion! Certainly, this was a better outcome than being unemployed. So remember, when you find yourself in the Dip, don’t doubt yourself and your commitment or abilities. Instead, lean into it and think of it as your friend, not your enemy. In the end, you’ll find yourself stronger and in a better position for having risen to the occasion. The key message in these blinks: In life, you should strive to be the best at what you do. And to make this happen, it’s important to focus your time and energy on the one thing that you’re skilled and passionate about, and to let go of projects that are competing for your interests. Once you get going with a project, you will eventually face a Dip – a period of struggle, effort and little reward. To make it through this period, you must use grit and patience. Once you make it through the Dip, you’ll find that your skills have improved and that you are now in a better position than many of your competitors. Therefore, the Dip is the path to success. Actionable advice: Keep going, especially when it hurts. We’re most inclined to give up during the moments when we feel hurt and discouraged. For example, in 1988 the Democrat Joe Biden was a promising candidate for the U.S. presidency. But then a scandal erupted around a trivial accident involving a quote in one of Biden’s speeches that had been mistakenly attributed to the wrong person. Biden was so discouraged by the overblown reaction that he withdrew his candidacy. However, if he’d persevered and allowed the minor scandal to blow over, he could very well have won. So think twice about retreating when you’re feeling wounded and vulnerable. It’s probably best to take a moment to lick your wounds and then forge ahead. Got feedback?

It’s certainly not an accident, and it’s not just because they throw their money around either. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to build (or rebuild) your organization from the ground up, with the cooperation of your employees. You’ll learn how to create a work environment that nurtures their talent and helps them get the most out of their jobs. And you’ll be surprised by how even simple changes can inspire them to reach higher levels of performance, resulting in financial success. As we go along, you’ll also learnt: why Facebook’s offices are more than just fun-filled working environments; why thinking about your organization’s wider impact on the world is crucial to its success; and how a NASA janitor inspired President Kennedy! What if every single one of your organization’s employees arrived at work truly excited about their jobs? What if they couldn’t wait to get started with their work each and every day? Some businesses have already figured out how to turn this dream into a reality. What’s their secret?  Well, its begins with the realization that focusing on employee experience is very different than focusing on employee engagement.  When seeking to promote employee engagement, companies try to find ways to better motivate their workers by making them feel more involved in the workplace. Unfortunately, they often end up simply trotting out the same old half measures that businesses have been rehashing since the 1980s.  For example, consider so-called “engagement initiatives.” Many employees have come into work one morning to find free snacks, a beer fridge or a sporadic team-building trip thrust upon them. Sure, they’re a great way to make employees feel better – for about five minutes. But these short-term cosmetic changes are outdated and wear off quickly. Focusing on employee experience instead leads to a very different approach. It involves a more holistic, long-term redesign of your entire organization. Here’s a useful metaphor for understanding what that means and why it’s important. Let’s say you’re rebuilding an old car. You can repaint the exterior and refurbish the interior, but without a new engine, the car’s performance is exactly the same!  To improve employee experience, you need to upgrade the engine of your organization. And what is that engine? Well, it can be split into three main components: the physical, technological and cultural environments of your workplace.  Let’s start with the physical environment. Facebook provides a well-known example of a company that has enhanced its employee experience by creating highly attractive, innovatively designed offices. But the social media giant didn’t build them just because they looked cool on paper. It spent a lot of time talking with its employees to figure out what they needed, and then it designed a physical environment to meet their requirements.  That’s one of the reasons why Facebook has become such a coveted place to work. By carefully listening to its employees’ expectations, desires and needs, a company like Facebook becomes an experiential organization – an organization that is truly focused on employee experience.  In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how an experiential organization can create an optimal physical environment for its employees. Then we’ll look at the technological and cultural environments.  When designing their workplaces, organizations often forget that their physical environments have to reflect their core values. A failure to remember this fact can spell disaster when you’re trying to create an optimal employee experience.  To see why, imagine you join a company that actively ignores the principles it claims to care about – like having a lack of recycling bins, despite professing eco-friendly values. Wouldn’t you feel lied to and betrayed? Experiential organizations always lead by example. We’ve heard that Facebook has great offices, but why are they so brilliant? Well, Facebook’s core values are: “Be bold. Focus on impact. Move fast. Be open. Build social value.” They have created a physical environment that reflects these values. For instance, its campus is filled with open floor plans, eclectic art, easily accessible spaces, a diverse group of employees and regular guest speakers. And why does Facebook make sure its campus looks and operates this way? Because they understand that employees perform better when they control how they work.  In today’s hyper-connected world, work/life balance has been replaced by work/life integration. Traditional notions like nine-to-five schedules and fixed workspaces are things of the past. Today, employees expect to be able to work from anywhere, anytime. This truth was corroborated by a study conducted by the professional services firm EY in 2015. They surveyed 10,000 employees around the world and found that flexibility is almost as important as a competitive salary. Offices therefore need to be imaginatively redesigned. To do so, organizations have to forget the simplistic open/closed debate – employees are away from their desks up to 60 percent of the time anyway. Instead, picture your office like a house with different spaces for distinct functions, moods and people. You could have private cubicles, cafes, lounges, co-working spaces, conference rooms, quiet areas and outside work areas. Organizations that undertake such radial changes reap equally radical rewards.  That was highlighted by a report from FlexJobs, a service that allows people to find flexible work options. They found that when people control when and where they work, it makes them more productive, healthier, happier and less stressed. And their organizations enjoy less absenteeism, increased trust and financial savings. However, don’t just copy Facebook or Google because they’ve got cool stuff! Your organization has different employees with different needs, so talk to them. Design with them, not for them. Over the last few decades, technology has revolutionized the world of work and knowing how to use the latest technology to make your employees’ lives easier is central. Experiential organizations know this. Consider the radical changes that the San Diego Zoo made when updating its technological environment. This 100-year-old nonprofit organization moved from conducting analogue training sessions in classrooms to implementing a free, flexible online learning system that employees could access anytime, anywhere.  The zoo also offered interest-free payroll deductions to its employees on their purchases of computers and tablets. This allowed hundreds of them to afford these technologies, which then enabled them to gain 24/7 access to the training. All of this led to better employee performance, as well as the conservation of natural resources. In the first year alone, the zoo’s human resources department cut down its paper usage by 100,000 sheets!   But be careful! It’s pointless to make technology available to everyone if it’s frustrating to use. Too often, internal technologies are geared towards IT professionals, resulting in clunky and confusing interfaces. You should avoid these by investing in consumer-grade technology: tools that are so well designed that ordinary people would be happy to use them in their personal lives. Here’s a case in point: the Royal Bank of Scotland, or RBS, recognized that most of its 100,000 employees used Facebook, so it rolled out Facebook for Work, the business version of Facebook, which combines next-generation technology with easy-to-use features.  If your employees already enjoy using it in their free time, why not let them use it at work? But first, you have to talk with your employees to find out what they actually need. To facilitate this process, you might consider teaming up your IT specialists with your human resources department. Otherwise, you might end up wasting money on great technologies that nobody asked for. The physical and technological environments are simple enough to understand. After all, you can touch them and see them. But the cultural environment is more intangible. You feel it on an emotional level. It leaves you with that pit-in-your-stomach feeling when you don’t want to go to work –  or that thrill you feel on Monday mornings when you do! Either way, your organization already has a cultural environment, and it has a huge impact on how your employees feel about their jobs. That’s why it’s arguably the most important environment to improve.  But where to start?  The answer can be summed up in a single word: teamwork. Strive to make all of your employees feel like they’re part of a valuable team. For example, Facebook tries to eradicate the idea of the individual altogether. When the company enjoys a success, it doesn’t highlight any of the particular people who contributed to the endeavor; instead, it only praises the teams involved.  There’s plenty of evidence in favor of taking a team-centered approach like Facebook’s. For example, in an experiment at Stanford University, participants were challenged to solve a puzzle on their own. Half of them were given clues that they were working as part of a larger team. The others were told nothing. The first group worked 48 percent longer and said the puzzle was more interesting than the second group did. The study’s conclusion? Simply feeling like they’re part of a team provides people with extra enthusiasm when they’re completing tasks.  Another way to boost your employees’ motivation is to help them feel a strong sense of purpose. To do this, try to actively show them the direct impact of all the hard work they do. If you then connect this work back to your organization’s core values, the results can be astounding. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than at NASA. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy was being shown around when he saw a janitor carrying a broom. He introduced himself and asked the man what he was doing. The janitor looked Kennedy dead in the eye and said, “Well, Mr. President, I’m helping put a man on the moon.” Unless you’re working for SpaceX, your organization is probably not trying to literally land a person on the moon – but what’s the metaphorical moon you’re aiming for? What’s your organization’s overarching goal? Whatever it is, make sure all of your employees have a clear understanding of it, so that even the janitorial staff feel like they’re a part of something great. It can take a lot of time and effort to implement the three key environments, so what’s the upside? Why should you care whether your employees have an amazing experience at work? Simple: people value experiences far more than material things. Research gathered across the Universities of Cornell, Chicago and California found that when people spend money on experiences, they feel happier over time. In contrast, when they spend money on physical items, their happiness nosedives in the long run. Following in the footsteps of that research, experiential organizations have figured out how to completely change their employees’ relationship with work. It’s no longer a physical purchase – their time in exchange for money – but an investment in a valuable experience. And to make that investment and deliver that experience, you have to cultivate the physical, technological and cultural environments of your workplace. The proof is in the pudding. Experiential organizations consistently perform at a higher level than their competitors. If you look at a combination of financial metrics, ranking lists, stock price performance and anecdotal evidence, you’ll find that experiential organizations consistently score the highest in customer service, innovation, employer attractiveness, employee happiness and brand value, to name just a few criteria. And the net result of all of this? Financial success.   Data provided by organizations such as Yahoo! Finance, PayScale and Fortune reveal even more incredible stats. Not only do experiential organizations have a 40 percent lower employee-turnover rate, but they also bring in more than double the average revenue and quadruple the average profit! Keep digging and you’ll find they have almost three times more revenue and over four times more profit per employee.  Take a moment to let those figures sink in. No matter your industry, your people are the key factors that ultimately separate you from your competition. If people actively want to work in your organization, you’ll attract the best talent. And if you have the top people, performing at their peak, then success will follow.  So what does a great employee experience look like? We’ll look at that in the next blink.  Most businesses are familiar with the idea of a mission statement – a formal summary of the company’s core aims. However, mission statements tend to be a little vanilla. They typically focus on things like profits, customer satisfaction and shareholder value.  For example, one major retailer states it aims “to be a leader in the distribution and merchandising of food, pharmacy, health and personal care items, seasonal merchandise, and related products and services.” While that’s a clear and honest ambition, it’s not exactly going to fill employees with rousing inspiration.  Experiential organizations go beyond a bland mission statement to create a more inspiring reason for being. A reason for being needs to focus on the impact your organization has on its community and the world at large. It shouldn’t have anything to do with financial gain. Instead, it should rally employees around a lofty goal that provides them with a calling for which they can continually strive to work better. Paradoxically, that means it should be an objective that’s both feasible and unachievable at the same time!  For example, Salesforce.org’s stated objective is to utilize one percent of all its resources, including its technology and people, to help improve communities around the world and encourage other companies to do the same. There’s no mention of profits, and it’s an ambition that can never be fully realized. After all, communities always have room for further improvement, and there’s always more that companies can do to help them. Thus, Saleforce.org’s objective provides its employees with a compelling reason to stand behind the company and continually strive to do better work.  Creating your reason for being is an exciting and foundational part of the process of becoming an experiential organization. However, as you’re pursuing it, make sure you seek out your employees’ input. You have to ask them what they believe your organization stands for and how it makes a difference in the world. Business changes fast – really fast! And this makes a great employee experience a moving target. To make sure your organization doesn’t get stuck in yesteryear, you need to create an infinite design loop. This means you have to listen carefully to your employees. To arrive at valuable insights, you have to seek out their input and analyze what they have to say. You can then use these findings to design solutions that can be launched quickly, so feedback can be gathered almost instantly. In other words, an infinite design loop is all about actively involving your employees in the process of improving their organization.  For example, Airbnb have created a highly successful design loop in an unlikely-seeming place: a dedicated food team. Airbnb now provide three meals a day for employees, who provide feedback directly to the food team. To solicit the employees’ input, the food team sends out an email before every meal with a menu and a link to a feedback form. When they design a new dish, they fire off an email to invite all employees to come taste it straight away – first come, first served! Thanks to this innovative design loop, 90 percent of employees say the food program helps to make them more productive, and more than half of them report that it’s a strong incentive to stay at Airbnb. Of course, to make a design loop successful, you have to really care about getting to know your people. Anyone can say they want to get in shape and then go for a run. But if someone really wants to be healthier, they have to make a long-term commitment to their fitness, and they have exercise on a continual, ongoing basis. .  The same holds true for creating a successful design loop. For example, annual reviews aren’t a bad thing, but they shouldn’t be relied on. When an annual review is the organization’s only point of contact with its employees, the design loop is too slow to work. It must be constant. With that in mind, try to make it super simple for employees to get involved in the design loop every day. Then provide the teams with the freedom to develop solutions and the power to launch them quickly. If you place your workers at the center of the design loop, then they will be literally creating their own employee experiences.  The “employee life cycle.” We’ve all heard the term, and we’ve all cringed. None of us thinks about our work in these terms, but for some reason organizations do. In truth, employe life cycles couldn’t be further from reality.  It’s therefore time to rethink this concept! So how can you design employee experiences based on how life actually works? Throw out the concept of life cycles and replace it with the idea of moments that matter.  A moment that matters is any event that significantly affects your experience of work. It could be starting the first day of your job, getting promoted, having a baby, attending a team-building exercise or celebrating a birthday. There are literally hundreds of possible moments that matter! But the only way to find the most important moments in your organization is by talking to your employees. This will have an instant and profound effect – your organization will begin looking at its employees as human beings, not job machines.  For example, despite having 70,000 global employees, the technology company Cisco has found a way to make each of them feel special by identifying 11 key moments that matter. One of these moments involves giving every employee five paid days off to volunteer for causes close to their heart.  Once you’ve found your organization’s moments that matter, they need to be supported by its three key environments. After all, there’s no point in working to improve these environments if they don’t feel personalized to each and every employee. You need to create environments that evolve with your people. How do you do that? Here’s one idea: on an employee’s first day of work, you could arrange for them to meet a customer who’s been positively affected by your organization. It’s an opportunity to showcase your cultural environment and provide your new team member with a strong sense of purpose.  Or maybe when an employee is in the middle of moving, you could mould their Physical Environment around them. You might offer additional flexibility of working hours and workspace options for example. But that’s just one possibility. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. The only road to success begins with talking to your employees. Ask them which moments and events have had the biggest impact on their experiences of working for the company, and take it from there. Who’s in charge of creating an optimal employee experience in your organization? The simple answer would seem to be, “everyone,” or, “the people at the top.” However, there’s a more complex, but also more productive way to think about how the optimization process works. It’s essentially a ripple effect, which kicks off with your organization’s senior leaders and then reverberates all the way down its hierarchy. The process has to be conceived and nurtured by the CEO and executive team. Ideas can come from anywhere, but they’re the ones who implement the organization's reason for being, and they must be the biggest ambassadors of the organization’s core values. Few leaders do this better than T-Mobile CEO John Legere. He spends weeks on the road talking to what he calls “the frontline” – employees who interact directly with customers. He passionately encourages them to complain to his face so honestly that they would fear getting fired if they were talking to a normal boss. His mantra is “listen to your frontline, shut up, and do what they say!”  Once the executives have rolled out a new employee experience, it has to be taken to heart by the organization’s various teams. To that end, experiential organizations have dedicated employee experience roles, which revolve around steering the optimization process. Airbnb has a chief employee experience officer, Adobe has an executive vice-president of employee experience, and Cisco has a chief people officer. These officers and their teams must then support the individual managers who drive the optimization process forward. The managers, in turn, have to encourage their own teams to speak up and not be afraid to complain.  And the employees themselves must also take responsibility. They have to constantly provide feedback, ideas and suggestions that might help improve the organization. Fostering an optimal employee experience therefore has to be a task that is championed by everyone. An experiential organization can only see the benefits if the concept of employee experience is embedded at every level. If you can achieve this, you’ll find your organization operating more like a laboratory, rather than a factory. Like a lab, experiential organizations don’t claim to have all the answers. In fact, they constantly test new ideas and embrace failure. They experiment every day to gather data and feedback. And most importantly, they support and encourage their people to do the same. If your organization can do all of this, then greater success will likely follow. And beyond the financial rewards, your organization can become a positive force for change in both the corporate sector and communities around the world. The key message in these blinks: In today’s business world, experiential organizations are far and away the most successful when measured by almost every metric. The key to their success is that they provide their employees with optimal physical, technological and cultural workplace environments. These environments, in turn, are fine-tuned by infinite design loops, fueled by a focus on teamwork and driven by a strong sense of purpose, which provides an experiential organization with its reason for being,  Actionable advice: Talk to someone at work about your gripes. Ask yourself, “If I could bottle up what it’s like to work at my organization and turn it into pill-form right now, would I swallow it?” If the answer is no, then ask your colleagues the same question. If they feel the same as you, speak up and instigate the requisite change.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

In fact, HR is responsible not only for the acquisition, training, appraisal and compensation of an organization’s employees, but also for dealing with issues like health and safety. So, if an organization truly wants to be successful, it needs to link its HR planning to its greater organizational strategy. For instance, it’s important for every organization to build a strategy that lays out exactly how its goals will be achieved. To make these goals a reality, the managers then allocate available resources. And here’s where HR comes in, because the people working in the organization are one such resource – and a very important one at that. After all, a typical human resources department will generally receive a hefty chunk of an organization’s budget to spend on things like salaries and benefits. So, if the organization fails to put its HR planning in line with its overall strategy, broad success will be hard to achieve. For example, if an organization hasn’t put together a strong benefits package for its current and future employees, it might struggle to attract the high-quality talent it needs to succeed. It’s important to keep HR updated on all organizational targets; doing so will help the department understand the role employees are meant to play in achieving these goals, which is the first step in determining whether the right people are on staff, and who still needs to be hired. It used to be that talent hunts could be conducted simply by running an ad in the newspaper – but times have changed. These days, you have to keep your competition in mind when attracting job applicants. Job seekers of today have much wider access to open positions through the internet. So, while your website is helpful, remember that applicants will be accessing those of your competitors as well, not to mention general job sites like monster.com. You’ll have to deal with the competition one way or another, and to do so you’ll need to let applicants know why they should apply to work for you and not someone else. This means clearly stating the benefits you offer and outlining exactly why working at your organization is so great. Once you’ve done that, you need to decide who you want to invite for an interview by reviewing resumes, comparing them to the specifics of the position and conducting brief screening interviews over the phone. You should begin by understanding the position you’re hiring for, which means determining what will be expected of applicants, what goals they need to achieve and what skills will be essential to their job. After those bases are covered, you can screen for basic requirements; for instance, is the applicant qualified and what are their salary expectations? After all, if they don’t meet these basic conditions, it’s not worth your time to interview them in person. Finally, you’ve gotten to the fun part: conducting a behavioral interview. This type of interview assumes that an applicant’s past performance is the best indicator of how they’ll do in the future. For such an interview, you’ll want to formulate questions that bring past performance to the fore and show you whether the candidate is a good match for the position. So, if you need someone who is flexible and adaptable, you might ask, “In previous jobs, did you ever have to change rapidly between different tasks? If so, how did you handle it?” So, you’ve found the perfect person for an open position and it’s his first day on the job. What should you do? Well, once you’ve brought a new employee on staff, it’s crucial to get him oriented at the organization. If he doesn’t know the basic facts of what you do, it’ll be difficult for him to know what he was hired to do. And remember, an orientation isn’t just a rapid overview of the organization; rather, it should accomplish several key objectives. One critical facet of the orientation is to make sure the new employee understands the organization broadly – that is, in terms of its history, corporate culture and vision – as well as in a detailed sense, such as how specific procedures work and how certain departments operate. Once you’ve done that, you should incorporate the new hire into the company and make sure he’s brought on board as efficiently as possible. If an organization wants to keep the employees it hires, it needs to make sure they’re onboarded properly. For instance, using Laurie Friedman’s Strategic Business Consulting as a benchmark, the authors explain that organizations have plenty of great opportunities to win over a new employee. In fact, one of them presents itself right away. It’s extremely beneficial if the organization makes a good first impression – after all, first impressions tend to be the ones that last. Early on in an interview, the prospective employee will make up his mind about the organization, determining whether he feels welcome there, among other things. So, if the organization makes a good impression here, it stands a much greater chance of holding on to the employee if and when he is hired. For example, the space in which the interview is conducted should be pleasant and comfortable, and careful attention should be given to the environment the prospective hire is walking into. Once you’ve hired, oriented and onboarded the right people, your work is done, right? Actually, there’s still a fundamental step left in the hiring process: training. Training is essential for both an organization and its employees. However, there are lots of different ways to do it, since different needs call for different forms of training. It’s in everyone’s best interests that employees are constantly developing their skills. Any organization will want competent, well-trained employees, and for them to be invested in developing their professional skills in order to stay competitive. So, while there are lots of different trainings out there, here are two particularly useful types: The first type is used to ensure employees, usually new ones, gain the skills necessary for the organization at the present moment. For instance, a new customer service representative will need to learn how to deal with customers in a polite, effective manner. The second type is for people who have been with the organization for a long time, but need additional training that adapts their behavior to organizational needs. For example, maybe one employee is not a great team player, but their current job requires much better teamwork skills. Then, once you’ve conducted a training program, you should take stock of how effective it was. Luckily, there’s an easy system for doing so: the four-level model developed by Professor Emeritus Donald Kirkpatrick in 1994. Here’s how it works: Level 1 is reactions. Here you want to identify how the employee responded to the training; did they like the material? Was it relevant? Level 2 is learning. Put simply, did the employee’s skill level increase? To determine this, you can conduct pre- and post-training tests to ascertain the degree of change. Level 3 is transfer. The aim here is to determine how much of the newly acquired skill gets transferred to an employee’s actual work. And finally, in level 4 you look at results. For this step, you measure the extent to which the training resulted in increased quality, sales or any other measure you choose. If you determine the training program was ineffective, you can change it the next time. For plenty of people in HR and management, monthly employee evaluations are a source of real stress and anxiety. But don’t worry – if done correctly, performance evaluations are a huge benefit to your organization, your employees and yourself. How? First of all, evaluations are a chance for you to tell an employee about the organization’s goals, and doing so will definitely increase their productivity. Knowing exactly what she is working toward will sharpen an employee’s focus and provide her with a motivating sense of purpose. But these evaluations will also help you hone your managerial skills and build a good rapport with your employees. After all, a good performance evaluation is a dialogue, not a lecture. Engaging in one is a chance to make your employees appreciate you and your listening skills. Finally, the evaluation process is a chance for employees to learn how they’re doing and identify specific changes they can make to improve. So, there are plenty of good reasons to conduct performance evaluations and to do so often. But to make these evaluations truly worthwhile, you’ll have to give both positive and corrective feedback in the right way. Here’s how: Positive feedback is used to encourage and reward employees. You can use the acronym FAST to guide you. It stands for frequent, accurate, specific and timely.  Positive feedback shouldn’t be rare or random; instead, it should be given out frequently, with accuracy and using specific information to avoid generalizations. But it’s also important for positive feedback to be timely, which means you shouldn’t offer it while having a casual lunch or on the way to a meeting. The second form, corrective feedback, can be a bit more challenging. Here you can use the acronym BEER, standing for behavior, effect, expectation and results. You’ll want to start by addressing the exact behavior that’s problematic, explaining the negative effect said behavior has on the organization and what you expect instead. And to close this constructive criticism on a positive note, you can tell the employee what positive results will come from altering their behavior. Does every one of your employees have the same attitude, nationality and gender? Of course not, and the workforce is growing more diverse by the day. A 2004 study done by the consulting company Hewitt Associates predicted the following for future US workforce trends: By 2008, 78 percent of the workforce was expected to be female and/or belong to a minority group. And by 2014, 75 percent of the United States’ new workforce was expected to come from Asia, making it increasingly likely for western corporations to employ people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. So, while we have obviously passed 2014 by now and these estimates should be checked for accuracy, the trend is apparent: the American workforce is growing in diversity, and is shifting in both conspicuous and subtle ways, such as its thinking patterns and religious beliefs. So what does this have to do with you? Well, it’s your job to manage diverse employees by ensuring an inclusive environment, one that accommodates all employees regardless of their knowledge, skills and abilities. For example, when you communicate with your employees, it’s essential that everyone understands you even if they might not be fluent in the language you’re using. After all, it’s hugely important that a new Chinese engineer on your team understand the procedure manual just as well as everyone else. Diversity is on the rise and, simultaneously, technological innovation is transforming the workplace. However, just because technology exists, this doesn’t necessarily mean it should be used. Your job is to determine how any given technology might help your company operate and adapt your investments as well as your policies to suit it. Technology has, for example, transformed the way we communicate. In many cases, face-to-face meetings have grown obsolete since you can just have a quick Skype call, leave a voicemail or shoot over an e-mail. But in some cases, technology is no substitute for meeting in person. As a manager, it’s your responsibility to know when that’s the case and have clear communication policies. The key message in this book: Human resource management is often underappreciated and left to fall by the wayside – but it’s actually a core aspect of any organization. As such, for any organization to be successful, HR should be well integrated into its daily work. Actionable advice: Act fairly and according to procedure when firing people. As an HR manager, it’s inevitable that you’ll have to fire people. Here are a few tips on how to do it in the best possible way: Always make sure the employee knows the reason for the termination of his or her employment; if the reason is poor performance, let them know so they have the chance to improve at their next job and into the future. Remember, if your organization has a standard procedure, you should follow it to avoid any possible claims of violation of contract. Got feedback?

Kahnweiler","summary":"Would you say you’re an introvert or an extrovert? If you’re unsure, it might be high time to find out, because, as these blinks make clear, being successful is often a matter of partnering up with your opposite. Although it might be easier to work with someone who is just like you, such partnerships rarely lead to new insights. Working relationships between extroverts and introverts, on the other hand, often result in true innovation.  In these blinks, you’ll learn why there is no John Lennon without Paul McCartney; the foolproof way to tell whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert; and how Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak overcame their differences and changed an entire industry. What would the introverted John Lennon have done without his extroverted counterpart, Paul McCartney? As their relationship proves, opposed personality types can create wonderful things when they work together.  You’ve probably heard time and time again that people are either introverts or extroverts. But can you explain the difference? It’s more than just a preference for solitude or company. Rather, it’s the way you recharge your batteries, so to speak, that makes all the difference.  If, after spending time in a large group of people, you feel the need to curl up alone for a while, then you’re probably an introvert. If you feel totally energized after hanging out with a crowd, but start to feel edgy and tired after spending too much time on your own, then you might be an extrovert. In short: introverts extract their energy from within, while extroverts absorb it from the outside world.  It’s perhaps not surprising, then, that introverts and extroverts don’t always see eye to eye. While introverts might regard extroverts as shallow, extroverts might perceive introverts as snobbish or cold. And so, though many high-performing extrovert-introvert duos seem to have a great collaborative relationship, these relationships are often torn apart by underlying differences.  Nobel Prize-winners James Watson and Francis Crick, for example, though utterly unlike one another, joined forces and made the twentieth century’s greatest scientific discovery: DNA. And yet they ceased to work together following this. Why? Because they no longer had a common goal that helped them overcome their differences.  Still, it is possible to create a great working dynamic between opposites. That’s what we’ll be exploring in the following blinks! Bringing together introverts and extroverts is like mixing oil and water. If you know the difference between them and have a few tricks up your sleeve, it is indeed possible.  After establishing who’s the extrovert and who’s the introvert, it’s time to assess the dynamics of your partnership. How? By comparing how each of you respond to certain statements. These statements will be akin to those you’d find on a standard personality test. Things like: “I can tell how a person is feeling from their body language” or “I am open to working with clients whose values conflict with mine.” The degree to which these statements hold true for each of you should be rated from “never” to “almost always.” The areas where your answers contrast the most are problem areas that the pair of you should work on. And how do you work on these personality clashes? By following the five steps that lead you to the genius of opposites, using the acronym ABCDE as a guide: Accept the alien; Bring on the battle; Cast the character; Destroy the dislike; and Each can’t offer everything.  We’ll work our way through each of these steps in the following blinks, but before we begin there’s one thing crucial to your partnership: sharing a concrete, long-term goal.  Legendary opposites Steve Jobs (an extrovert) and Steve Wozniak (an introvert) were bound by the long-term goal of bringing computers to the public. This goal gave the partnership the common ground they needed to overcome their clashing personalities, paving the way for revolutionary collaborative work.  So, once you’ve got your common goal, it’ll be time to get started with the five steps mentioned above.  We’re always told to accept others for who they are. Seemingly simple advice. But it’s not so easy to follow when your partner starts attacking your ideas or starts being passive aggressive.  Accepting the alien is a major challenge for members of collaborative partnerships. We often wish that our partner functioned more like we function, sometimes pushing them to adjust to our approach. This leads to animosity and resentment. Meanwhile, the pressure of deadlines often brings out our less fortunate traits, making it difficult to calmly resolve conflict.  But trying to get your partner to be more like you is simply misguided. Personality types are deeply ingrained, so it’s best to accept your partner for the introvert or extrovert that they are. If you and your partner have a disagreement, try to understand why they’re acting or reacting the way they are, even if it’s completely alien to you. If you can do that, you’ll have cut your stress in half.  After you’ve accepted the alien in your partner, it’s time to bring on the battle. While having conflicts can be unpleasant, it’s also the fastest path to creative problem solving. Two heads are better than one, and having another voice to criticize your assumptions is one of the best things about having a partner.  Luxury automobile firm Chrysler, for instance, made huge financial gains during a period when it was lead by a great partnership. Opposites Robert Lutz, an extroverted auto executive, and Robert Eaton, the introverted Chrysler CEO, welcomed productive disagreement with open arms.  Unfortunately, this all changed when Jürgen Schrempp became CEO after the Chrysler-Mercedes Benz merger. Schrempp saw himself as a better leader than Robert Eaton, who in turn kept his concerns to himself. The partnership was rocky, with Eaton ultimately leaving the company. Without accepting different personalities and welcoming conflict, partnerships simply can’t flourish.  Accepting differences and welcoming conflict are two key parts of a successful partnership. In the next blink, you’ll learn about three more. Each person has strengths that align perfectly with certain roles in a team. What are yours? Are you the gal who loves to organize it all or the guy who knows how to keep morale high? If you don’t know, it’s time to find out! The third step toward creating a brilliant partnership is casting the character. Every partnership benefits from clear roles and responsibilities. If nobody knows what their duties are, your partnership won’t reach its full potential.  Chinese online marketplace Alibaba has achieved massive success under a partnership with clearly defined roles. Jack Ma, Alibaba’s founder, and his corporate equivalent, Jonathan Lu, have contrasting responsibilities that bring out the best in the company.  Ma is the visionary – the creative one who sees opportunities for expansion and future financial success. Lu is the planner, turning these visions into reality by delving into details, structure and organization. Together they created a thriving marketplace that not only provides a platform for online auctions, but offers other services, such as a means of transferring funds.  The next step in your partnership is destroying the dislike. Great partnerships need not be built upon a close friendship, but they should at least have a foundation of firm mutual respect.  Let’s return to the partnership of Jobs and Wozniak. By no means were they great friends. In fact, they were often at loggerheads. But they had mutual interests and passions and, because of this, respected each other. Because of that, they were able to radically alter the course of computer technology while also encountering new sides of their own personalities, broadening their worldviews in the process. Now, there’s just one step left that’s necessary for your partnership, and it’s all about staying realistic: each can’t offer everything. We can’t hope to do things all by ourselves. For all our strengths, some of our weaknesses mean we aren’t equipped to solve certain problems. We need our partners, and our partners need us. The key message in this book: The clash between introverts and extroverts isn’t something to avoid in business partnerships. Rather, it’s the very thing you should foster! By putting extra effort into embracing dialogue, supporting strengths and balancing out each other’s weaknesses, you’ll take your collaboration to its full creative and productive potential.      Suggested further reading: The Introverted Leader by Jennifer Kahnweiler Kahnweiler explores the specific challenges introverts face in an extroverted business world.

If you want to bring your project to completion, you’ll have to motivate the unmotivated, inspire shirkers to pull their weight and deal with uncommunicative superiors who expect you to read their minds. In short, people problems are everywhere. Solving them isn’t an easy task. Today’s workplaces are more horizontal than ever before, and old-school, command-and-control management techniques are distinctly passé. That means you’ll have to tread a fine line if you want to maintain your authority without alienating your employees. Luckily, you’re not alone. World-renowned management consultant Zachary Wong has crafted the ultimate hands-on guide to navigating this hazardous terrain. Built around eight core people skills, these blinks will show you how you can start aligning individual psychology with your organization’s key objectives. Along the way, you’ll learn: why today’s businesses resemble a wedge rather than a pyramid; how to manage employees’ attitudes and why they matter; and why you should be friendly, not friends, with your team members. Whether it’s a general casting his eye over the battlefield or a manager analysing the business environment, successful leadership is all about adapting strategy to the facts on the ground. And when the facts change, it’s vital to change your approach. That also goes for project management – after all, the world of business has experienced dramatic changes in recent decades. In the old days, corporations resembled pyramids. At the top sat a small number of powerful executives. Below them were the senior managers who relayed instructions to middle managers, who, in turn, oversaw the largest and least powerful group: employees. It was a top-down model; responsibility, pay and prestige increased the further up the pyramid you went. Rising through the ranks was a steep and difficult climb. Today, that model seems increasingly passé. The idea that the workers at the base of the structure are laborers requiring an autocratic, command-and-control approach is outdated. Modern businesses are increasingly becoming more democratic structures. The contemporary workforce is more educated, skilled and tech-savvy than ever before, and employees expect to see that reflected in their roles. What they want, in other words, isn’t just a paycheck but an opportunity to realize their potential. Businesses have responded to this new reality by shifting from a pyramid model to a wedge structure. Imagine cutting a pyramid in half and laying it on its side. It now looks like a doorstop-shaped wedge with three sections interacting on a horizontal rather than a vertical axis. At the smallest end are individual contributors – employees whose unique contributions are essential to the organization’s overall success. In the middle are work teams – groups of contributors working toward a common goal. Finally, there’s management. The size of their section doesn’t reflect their absolute numbers, but rather the amount of power and resources at their disposal. This model requires project managers to play a new role. As a team leader in this structure, your job is to work fluidly between all three sections, connecting individual performance to your organization’s strategic aims. Call it organizational alignment, which is essentially about understanding the way the small details of managing relationships with individual contributors affects the success of the company as a whole. In the next blink, we’ll look at the first key skill: using the wedge model to manage performance and people problems. Today’s project managers play a vital coordinating role, and it’s your job to make sure all three sections of your company’s wedge structure are working together. So what do you do when things go wrong? Well, like a doctor, you’ll need an accurate diagnosis before you can prescribe a course of action. The wedge model is a diagnostic tool that helps you do just that. Let’s stick with our medical analogy for a second. When you visit a doctor, he’ll usually do two things: first, locate the problem – is it, say, a back or a heart problem? Second, he’ll determine whether he’s competent to treat the complaint or if he needs to refer you to a specialist. Team leaders follow a similar procedure: they find out whether a problem is an individual, team or management issue, and then they decide whether they need to make a referral. Imagine one of your team members complains to you about her colleague. She tells you that a coworker has been yelling at her and criticizing her performance. It’s gotten so bad, she adds, that she can’t complete her assignments. That’s clearly a team issue, right? Yes, but there’s also another dimension: workplace harassment is a serious legal matter. While you can take proactive steps as a team leader to limit contact between these two employees, you also need a specialist – in this case, a human resources manager. In other words, you need to wedge the problem up to management, which possesses the necessary resources and expertise to handle situations like this. What about individual employees’ problems? Although it might seem like a daunting task, there’s actually a fairly simple way of getting to the root of these problems. Call it the ERAM Model. That stands for expectations, resources, ability and motivation– the four key performance factors. To make a diagnosis, you’ll need to listen to employees’ explanations of their problems, while taking steps to independently verify their accounts. Does the individual understand your expectations and is their task clear to them? If so, do they have enough time, the right equipment and the requisite information to complete that task? How about their skills and knowledge – are they up to the job you’ve given them? Finally, are they motivated enough to get it done?  One you’ve answered those questions, it’s time for you to write a prescription: a clear and measurable action plan for improvement, which you can use to quantify progress. We’ve seen that the modern workplace emphasizes horizontal rather than hierarchical relationships. This means that boundaries between different roles are more porous, and leaders are often on friendlier terms with their subordinates than they used to be. That can put you in an awkward situation. After all, friends are equals; they do each other favors, make exceptions and let mistakes slide. But that’s the last thing you can afford to do as a leader tasked with making tough calls. So how do you square this circle? Well, it’s vital to understand that there’s a difference between friendship and friendliness. Take Robert, a project manager at a hypothetical IT firm, and Thomas, a software engineer in his team. Driving out of the company parking lot one evening, Robert comes across Thomas’s car in a ditch next to a road owned by the company. Official policy states that all accidents on the premises have to be reported and that the vehicles involved shouldn’t be moved until a report has been filed. Thomas, however, asks Robert to help him tow his car, promising he’ll fill in an official report as soon as he gets home. Team leaders face ethical quandaries like this all the time. The problem is that you can’t always be on both sides. Sometimes you have to decide whether you represent your company and its values or your employee. In this case, Thomas is clearly pushing Robert to act as his friend rather than his superior. So what should Robert do? The key here is to remember that leadership is about being friendly, not friends. Think of it this way: friendliness is a behavior rather than a relationship. Robert’s best bet, in other words, is to firmly but politely insist on sticking to the rules. That’s a great example of a key leadership attribute: being hard on policies rather than people. A true leader in Robert’s situation would be able to show that he understands Thomas’s feelings of frustration that the incident can’t be quickly resolved, while maintaining his authority as a manager. Thomas might resent Robert’s insistence on following procedure, but he can’t really complain. At the end of the day, Robert is Thomas’s superior, not his buddy. However much we might wish the case were otherwise, a company isn’t a club or a family, but a business! The most effective teams are greater than the sum of their parts. They share a sense of purpose, champion collaborative work and regularly exceed performance expectations. Whatever their differences, they all share one thing: they espouse inclusiveness. That’s all about involving employees in day-to-day processes and keeping them in the loop. Making people feel like they’re in the loop is one of the most important human factors when it comes to building successful teams. Why? Well, “the loop” is a place of safety, trust and support that makes the workplace feel like a second home. Most importantly, it fulfils a hardwired human need: the desire for a sense of purpose and acceptance. If you want to make people feel like they’re in the loop, you have to get a handle on what motivates and demotivates them. So how do you do that? Well, a good place to start is to look at different personality types. Take the 1984 book Please Understand Me by psychologists David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates, which identified four different types of personality: rationals, guardians, idealists and artisans. Identifying which of these types team members most resemble is a tool that will help you figure out the best way to motivate employees. Each type responds to distinct push and pull factors, which can either lead to disengagement or engagement. Rationals, for example, love logical tasks; they want autonomy and fear failure. Guardians are more cooperatively inclined, seeking respect and shying away from conflict. Idealists are emotional; they cherish fairness and loathe bullies. Finally, artisans are individualists who like taking risks and hate boredom. But inclusiveness isn’t something that just happens when people come together to work as a team; it’s an attitude that needs to be fostered. At its heart is the idea that the “we” is more important than the “me.” The problem is that lots of common workplace policies stand in the way of fostering genuine team spirit. For example, many of them reward individuals rather than teams. That means your role is to constantly work toward putting the team first. That can be as simple as asking all of your  team members to contribute something to the improvement of the team each month, rather than just concentrating on their individual work. Mentoring schemes, seminars or team lunches are highly effective ways of cementing the “we” spirit. As we’ve seen, people expect more from their work today than they did in the past. They don’t just want a paycheck and camaraderie – they also want job satisfaction. That’s something you’ll have to give them as a team leader, especially if you want them to go the extra mile that gives your company an edge.   To do that, you have to start managing people’s attitudes. Take the hypothetical case of Charlie, a young kid whose mom takes him to an ice cream parlor when he does well in school. One day, his mother tells him to get a napkin before eating his treat. As he reaches for it, he drops his ice cream cone. “Well,” she says, “you should’ve kept your cone up.” To Charlie, it’s the most unfair thing in the world, and he’s about to throw a tantrum. His mom, however, tells him to calm down and talk to the vendor. The vendor takes pity on Charlie and gives him another scoop for free. So what’s the lesson here? Well, there are a couple. Let’s break them down. The first is simple: everyone likes ice cream, in one form on another, when they’ve been good. That’s something a lot of employers forget. A study carried out by the American Psychological Association in 2011, for example, found that while 69 percent of employees were happy with their jobs, only 46 were happy with their employers’ recognition practices. No wonder! There’s nothing quite as de-motivating as getting “coned” – doing something good and never receiving the ice cream you feel you deserve. The simplest and most effective way of managing attitudes is to make sure you remember this lesson and reward your team’s hard work. Whether that’s a congratulatory email, a pat on the back or something more extravagant depends on the situation. What really matters is that you SCOOP your praise: make it sincere, consistent, on time, on values and personalized. The final lesson is this: good things happen when you look on the bright side – think of it as keeping your metaphorical cone up. When things go wrong, it’s a natural human reaction to want to throw in the towel. It’s inevitable that employees will mess up occasionally; the important thing is what they do next. Sometimes, you just have to be Charlie’s mom and remind them that behaving badly when bad things happen only makes things worse. Sometimes, the promise of ice cream just doesn’t work. The truth is that you’ll come across employees who shirk, whine, procrastinate, make excuses and – worst of all – claim that they’re actually doing a great job, even as they fail to hit their targets. Dealing with them will be one of your toughest tasks as a team leader. In fact, it’s so tricky that lots of managers will do anything to avoid tackling it. Why? Well, take a survey of 68 local government supervisors carried out by E. L. Perkins of the University of North Carolina in 2012. When they were asked what stopped them dealing with underperformers, 59 percent cited their fear of confrontation, 49 percent their inability to handle awkward conversations and 41 percent their unwillingness to get people in trouble. It’s a great example of the author’s maxim that people problems are like minefields – no one wants to go there. But someone eventually does have to deal with the issue. After all, you can’t reward bad behavior, and letting it go unchecked will undermine your team’s projects. Fortunately, there’s a tool you can use to get troublemakers back onside. Call it the Past-Present-Future Model. Let’s take a closer look at how it works. As the name suggests, the model consists of three stages. Let’s say an employee comes to you with a problem. He’s struggling and feeling down, which is affecting his motivation. Your job is to guide him through the problem stage by stage. Think of it like a movie: once you’ve shot a scene, you move forward. Your first scene is the past. Here, you want to practice active listening and find out about the problem. Be patient and let him tell you his story, but make sure to hold him to account by asking him to provide evidence. In the second scene, your job is to provide a diagnosis. For example, is it a resource problem or a personal issue? Next, you offer a reality check: essentially, you put the problem in context and remind the employee of the rules and regulations that apply to his situation. In the third scene, you move into the future tense. Ask the employee questions like “what can you do to improve things?” and set concrete targets, which you can both use to evaluate improvement. Do the ends justify the means? Marty thought so. He was a bullish manager hired to oversee a telecommunications company’s expansion into a new regional market. He had a gung-ho attitude to winning new contracts. A couple of years in, things were looking great: the firm was seemingly well-established and had a ton of new clients. Then came the audit. It turned out Marty’s team had been offering such generous terms to the clients in the new market that they’d basically bankrupted the new branch office. Marty’s mistake isn’t an uncommon one. In fact, companies often lose their way when a team’s behavior is poorly managed. So how can you avoid this trap? Well, a good place to start is to realize that behavior doesn’t just happen – it needs to be inspired. That has two sides: external and internal, or goals and values. Marty communicated his goal of landing new contracts very well, but he did a much worse job at telling his employees that the means were just as important as the ends. As a result, they felt free to disregard ethical guidelines and eventually bankrupted the new branch! Defining your core values and the behavior you expect from team members at the outset is the simplest way of making sure everyone’s on the same page. At the most abstract level, that means using your company’s official policies and regulations to define expected behavior. More concretely, it’s about establishing ground rules to nudge people toward adopting the right values and behavior. So if, say, tardiness is an issue and meetings are running late, you could inspire greater punctuality by asking repeat offenders to give their presentations first – a gentle nudge toward getting into the office on time. That’s a good example of the author’s emphasis on being tough on problems, not people. But simply laying down the law isn’t enough on its own; you also need to police it. That brings us to consequences. There are four types of consequential responses to behavior. The first is positive reinforcement – encouraging people to repeat their actions through praise. Next, there’s negative reinforcement – think of an email that quietly reprimands someone for being late to an appointment. Then there’s the non-response. This is used to signal that you’re happy to leave neutral issues, such as workplace clothing, to people’s own discretion. Finally, there’s punishment. This is the harshest response and reserved for clear ethical or legal offenses against company policy. Business is all about taking risks. But no matter how much time you put into analyzing the market before taking the plunge, there’s always a degree of uncertainty. That’s both normal and unavoidable, but it can also undermine effective project management. Why? Well, uncertainty generates fear and anxiety, which, in turn, affects your willingness to take the risks that are essential to success. Call it the Black Box Effect. However carefully you inspect what’s in front of you, there’s no telling what’s inside the box. It could be a trick, a trap or a treat – there’s simply no way to know before you open it. The problem, however, is that humans have a hardwired survival instinct that makes them innately cautious. That’s pretty handy when you’re out on the savannah facing down lions, but it can be a problem in the boardroom. So why’s that box so scary? There are three factors at play – call them the three uncertainties of risk-taking. The first is circumstance: when you’re weighing up a risky move, you can’t predict just how challenging it’s going to be. That brings us to the second issue: ability. If you don’t know what’s ahead of you, you tend to worry that your talents won’t be enough to handle the situation. Finally, there’s the most elemental fear: failure. This kind of fear might be natural, but that doesn’t mean you can’t push past it. That’s because risk-takers aren’t fearless – they’ve simply learned how to manage fear. Take firefighters. To do their  jobs, they have to take risks. But they’re not blasé about fire and collapsing buildings – in fact, they know better than most people just how dangerous they are. But they manage their fear by concentrating on something else: their opportunity to help people. However, firefighters don’t just turn up and hope for the best when there’s an emergency – they also train and prepare themselves for what might lie ahead. That’s something you should start doing as well. So, say you’ve been asked to give a speech, but you’re terrified of public speaking. When you think about it, there are all sorts of steps you can take to set yourself up for success. For example, you could visit the venue beforehand and familiarize yourself with the equipment you’ll be using or re-arrange the seating to encourage a more interactive Q&A session so you’re not always in the spotlight. Your role as a team leader is full of tough calls and awkward situations. Dealing with difficult employees is hard enough, but that’s nothing compared to your relationship with your boss. In this blink, we’ll take a look at one of the most important people skills you’ll ever learn: getting along with superiors. It’s a vital bit of know-how. After all, your health and happiness depend on it. Take it from a 2014 Harvard Business School survey of 20,000 employees working across a broad variety of industries. According to the survey, people who felt respected by their managers were healthier and more satisfied with their careers. Meanwhile, a 2015 Gallup survey of 7,272 American adults found that one in two had quit a job at some point to escape difficult bosses and improve their quality of life! So how can you improve your position and your relationship with your boss? Well, it’s important to realize that your relationship isn’t as one-sided as it might sometimes appear. In fact, team leaders and their superiors are mutually dependent. Sure, there’s a clear imbalance in power and resources – after all, the bosses are the ones calling the shots when it comes to funding, timing and priority-setting. But they’re also reliant on your knowledge, skill and insight to steer projects to completion. That means the imbalance in power doesn’t need to develop into an imbalance in respect, honesty and trust. Putting your relationship on a more equal footing is all about managing up. Think of it this way: while you can’t control your supervisor’s behavior, you can control your own behavior when you’re interacting with a higher-up. And the most effective thing you can do in those situations is to make yourself more visible. That means stepping up to the plate and showing what you’re all about with your actions. It can be as simple as making sure you always arrive on time for meetings, being proactive and speaking up when others don’t or going out of your way to attend optional work events, such as team drinks and seminars. Those might sound like trivial examples, but they’re actually highly effective ways of communicating your support for your boss. That kind of can-do attitude has a halo effect. Once they know you’re on their side and always ready to get involved, your superiors are much more likely to knock on your door when they have a problem or a new assignment. The key message in these blinks: Team leaders constantly run up against people problems. Whether it’s underperformers, employees pushing you to be their friend rather than their supervisor, or a tricky boss you have to deal with, project management can be a psychological minefield. But there are tools you can start using today to clear a path through this hazardous terrain. If you learn the eight key people skills for project management, you’ll be well-positioned to manage fear, boost your team’s sense of collective purpose and put the relationship with your superiors on a more equal footing.  Actionable advice: Use the 80 percent rule to keep meetings on track.  If you’ve been in a meeting recently, you know how the conversation has a natural tendency to drift at some point. The vaguer the discussion becomes, the greater the chances are that you’ll overrun your allotted time. That’s frustrating, especially when people have a ton of work waiting for them on their desks. So why not start enforcing the 80 percent rule? By the time 80 percent of the time devoted to the meeting has passed, you’ll most likely have covered the main points. So announce that you’ve reached the 80 percent mark. If there’s still a key point on the agenda, you’ll focus everyone’s minds; if there isn’t, you can end the discussion and move on to other tasks.

Have you ever wondered if any of your coworkers are afraid to truly be themselves – and reveal their sexual orientation openly at work? Sharing his experiences as a gay executive, the author offers valuable insight into today’s environment for gay and transgender employees in the workplace. In these blinks, you’ll learn how employees and companies can thrive when they embrace people’s differences in sexual orientation. In these blinks, you’ll discover which countries continue to discriminate against gay and transgender people; how Apple’s CEO feels about gay marriage; and why companies that support gay and transgender rights are successful. Despite many developments toward expanded equal rights, homophobia is still a real issue in society. In some countries such as Uganda, gay people have no legal protection. If authorities discover that someone is gay, that person could be sent to prison, or worse, even killed. Yet persecution based on sexual orientation wasn’t always a fear. In ancient Rome and Greece, gay people were treated equally. Some societies even considered gay people sacred. The Roman emperor Hadrian lived as an openly gay man. Greek gods such as Zeus were depicted in fables as taking male lovers; believers saw such acts as normal. The spread of Christianity, however, changed the public’s perception of homosexuality. Many believers have used their interpretation of the book of Leviticus in the Bible to justify the repression and persecution of people based on sexual orientation. Such religious condemnation has played a major role in branding gay people across the world as “sinners,” making them the targets of Christian violence. But such horrors aren’t limited to ancient history. Since the seventeenth century, gay people have been used as scapegoats for many of society’s troubles. Deadly earthquakes, the bubonic plague and more recently AIDS have all been blamed on the influence of gay people in society. What’s more, in Western nations such as Germany and the United Kingdom, being gay was a crime until very recently. During the Nazi regime in Germany, thousands of gays and lesbians were sent to concentration camps; they were given a pink triangle to wear, identifying them to others and signifying their low status in society. Even after World War II, being gay in Germany remained a crime for decades. Homosexual relations between men in England was made legal only in 1967. Take a moment to consider this question honestly: can you truly be yourself at work? Do you feel you have to hide any part of your personality from your coworkers? Most people feel comfortable at work, just as they do at home. But the same often isn’t true for gay people. The feeling that one has to hide or disguise one’s true identity is a situation with which many gay people around the world are familiar. People are working to change this situation, however. Many Fortune 500 companies are actively trying to improve their business culture to create an environment in which employees feel comfortable coming out. Some of these companies have established support groups or hang posters in the workplace that inform employees that they are accepted members of the corporate team, whatever their sexual orientation. Apple CEO Tim Cook, for example, has publicly stated that his company fully supports marriage equality. Such a clear defense of equal rights for gay people allows employees more freedom to express their opinions and not feel they have to hide their identity from others. Yet many gay people still fear that coming out at work will ruin their careers. One reason for this is that there are few openly gay role models higher up on the corporate ladder. Overall, there is a distinct lack of gay, bisexual or transgender executives to whom employees can look for inspiration and strength. If employees do happen to find a highly successful gay executive, that executive is likely to have been attacked at some point in his or her career. The author resigned his position at energy giant BP, for example, after an ex-boyfriend leaked a story about the author’s sexual orientation to the British newspaper Daily Mail. This exposé not only hurt the author personally and professionally but also gave other gay people the impression that they too might face a similar situation if they dared to come out at work. The number of people coming out at work grows daily. What’s more, these openly gay, bisexual and transgender employees through the process of coming out are living more fulfilled lives overall. Coming out has tremendous benefits, whether at work or in general. Living life “in the closet” requires inhuman energy, as a person lives in constant fear of being “outed.” For instance, LGBT activist Louise Young has developed a productivity index that suggests closeted gay employees are some 10 percent less productive than heterosexual coworkers. After coming out, gay or transgender employees can channel more creative energy into the work at hand. Coming out could even help an employee improve the productivity of his or her entire team. Kirk Snyder, an associate professor at the University of Southern California, through his research, suggests that gay managers might treat employees more inclusively and better motivate colleagues than heterosexual counterparts. As gay managers have experienced being part of a minority group, Snyder contends, they can be more open and fair with others, especially other minorities. Interestingly, employees working for openly gay male managers report significantly higher satisfaction than employees working under heterosexual male managers. But while coming out has its benefits, not all gay or transgender people have had a positive experience when revealing their sexual orientation to coworkers. Some are mocked; some find they earn less than heterosexual peers; some are victimized by homophobic bosses and even fired. Gay men in particular often are ridiculed by peers who irrationally believe that they are “by nature” prone to acting flirtatious – and in some instances, they are seen as predatory. Since this prejudice still predominates in society, it influences working environments too, and can determine whether gay people are hired or promoted within a company. Would you want to work in a company that doesn’t support you? Would you buy a product from a company that you know has no interest in supporting equal rights? Probably not. Unsurprisingly, gay, bisexual and transgender people are far more likely to work for and buy from businesses that respect their sexual orientation and equal rights overall. In fact, gay, bisexual and transgender people not only pay attention to the progressive values of the companies for which they work but also often know which companies are active in the fight for equal rights for gay people. Some 58 percent of gay adults say they’re more likely to buy from companies which actively support equal rights for gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and market specifically to these communities. To help them make informed decisions, many gay consumers consult the Buying for Workplace Equality Guide, which is published by the Human Rights Campaign. This guide details which companies have the best records of not only promising to support equal rights for gay people but also living their commitments. Creating a more gay-friendly environment isn’t just good for a company’s bottom line. It also helps companies attract other minorities, such as employees from different racial backgrounds, therefore diversifying a company’s workforce for the better. Here’s an example of this policy in action. Claudia Brind-Woody is the co-chair of IBM’s LGBT diversity task force. At a job fair, she noticed that an unusually high number of young Asian women were visiting the IBM booth. When she asked some of them why they were interested in working at IBM, they said that if the company was open in its support of gay rights, it was probably also welcoming of minority groups, too. Do you know whether your company supports equal rights for gay, bisexual and transgender people? If you don’t know, then it’s time your company makes more vocal its message to not only its employees but also the market at large. If employees are unaware that their employer is working to improve conditions for gay, bisexual and transgender people, many will choose to remain in the closet. Companies need to communicate that coming out is not only safe to do, but also will be celebrated. Even if there is some pushback from employees who may harbor homophobic feelings, a company needs to stress that the corporate culture is both opposed to and will address hate in the workplace. When a company is actively working to improve conditions at the office, employees will know that efforts at diversity and inclusion are real. One way to do this is to share stories of other employees who have come out and been received positively by coworkers. Support of equal rights for gay people also needs to be an active topic of discussion among company leaders, so that correct policy trickles down to all levels of an organization. Many business leaders already support gay, bisexual or transgender employees or have already revealed their sexual orientation publicly. While such information is crucial in making employees feel comfortable coming out at work, it often doesn’t reach the rank and file of an organization. Thus leaders need to speak out to show the whole company that they will stand up for every employee regardless of sexual orientation. Vocal support from gay and straight allies alike is powerful. And even when company executives are heterosexual, their open support of equal rights for gay people is crucial toward creating a more inclusive, welcoming workforce for everyone. Leaders at Google, for example, are vocal about their commitment to diversity within the workforce. Every year the company officially participates in gay pride parades. Thomas Hitzlsperger, a famous German soccer player, came out as gay in 2013. The announcement was met with overwhelming support, a sign that society is finally becoming more accepting of gay people. This marks a significant change from just a few decades ago when athletes, politicians and other public figures would face severe criticism for coming out. Many as a result chose to remained closeted for fear of destroying a career. Billie Jean King, a former professional tennis player, had won several Grand Slam titles by the time she came out in 1981. That same day she lost all her professional sponsorships, worth over $2 million. Today even the world of sports has embraced gay athletes. What’s more, the public’s response to prominent athletes coming out has been largely positive. Certain professional fields tend to be much more supportive of equal rights for gay people than others. While gay people have long occupied executive positions in the world of publishing, for example, coming out as a professional athlete was just not done until recently. Many sports teams and even sports brands such as Nike now are proud to support gay athletes, standing up against discrimination and hate. This sort of support is reflected in society, as people come to accept openly gay athletes more and more. In 2013, British Olympic swimmer Tom Daley came out publically. Rather than receiving a stream of hate mail as he feared he would, Daley was embraced with positive messages and support. Former athletes even congratulated him on his extraordinary bravery. The key message in this book: Coming out can be one of the most powerful experiences in a gay person’s life, but it can also be one of the most dangerous. While many countries have enacted laws to ensure equal rights for gay people, there is still much work to be done in society, and especially in the workplace. Employees and employers alike should strive to make the office a safe space for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.  Actionable Advice When a person comes out, be considerate and thoughtful.  If someone trusts you sufficiently to come out to you, it’s important to be kind and considerate, and above all, to honor that person’s trust. Tell the person that you support them and ask how best you can be there for them. If you don’t know how to immediately respond, don’t panic. If faced with feelings that are conflicting, instead of speaking rashly, calmly explain that you need time to reflect. Doing so will give you needed space so you can respond to your colleague rationally and positively. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It seems that the ordinary worker is being exploited by those at the top as leaders take an ever bigger slice of the corporate pie, leaving their employees with barely enough to survive. So how can good, decent leaders change this hostile public narrative and recover the reputations of leaders everywhere? The answer has to do with heroism. Heroic leadership is a powerful antidote to the sort of greed, selfishness and short-termism that has become rife among our most powerful executives. Discover how any leader can go from zero to hero and radically change the perception of their employees and the wider community. By examining real-life success stories and inspirational lessons from the author’s own career, we’ll learn how leaders can transform their relationships with their staff, and learn why, when it comes to people and profits, leaders don’t need to choose between one or the other. Read on to discover: Why great leaders never go it alone; What you can learn from Captain “Sully” Sullenberger’s incredible flight landing; and What happened when Starbucks failed to live up to its own heroic ideals. In the era of #metoo, when so many of our corporate leaders are being caught up in odious scandals, it can be easy to adopt a cynical approach toward them all. Are they really interested in the well-being of the ordinary people who work for them, or are they just out for themselves, exploiting those lower down the food chain along the way? In this climate of extreme distrust, we need executives who can refute these terrible examples of toxic leadership and prove that the good guys are still winning. In other words, we are in desperate need of heroic leaders. The author’s journey toward heroic leadership started in 2009, when he was invited to attend the annual conference of Hero Partners, a nationwide club for leaders in charge of fast-growing businesses who are also committed to responsible, sustainable and compassionate entrepreneurialism. The author, himself a Chief Marketing Officer at the time, was so impressed with Hero Partners and its values that if he went all in and bought the company in 2016. So what are the heroic values that the author and his club of forward-thinking entrepreneurs believe all leaders should live by? Well, commitment and courage are essential. Specifically, leaders need the commitment and courage to constantly find ways to give something back and to serve others, including their employees, their communities, or the environment. Simple, right? Perhaps, but most businesses these days are doing a poor job in this regard. Instead, they’re wholly focused on three totally different things: their clients, their shareholders and their bottom line. And the hard-working employees? They’re overlooked, not listened to, and have to make do with scraps from the boardroom table. So what’s the solution? As we’ll find out, leaders can go from zero to hero by recalibrating their focus, ensuring that their workers, and even the wider community, start to feel that the company’s goals are aligned with their own. These employee goals are likely to include having a decent life for themselves while doing the best they can at work. Ask yourself, are you, as a leader, committed to this goal, too? If not, it’s time to re-read your company’s mission statement, where these goals are likely enshrined, and get to work on embodying them. What do you, as a leader, value more: profit or people? This deceptively simple question is usually the author’s first question to business leaders he meets. And in fact, the most heroic answer is neither one nor the other. The hero’s answer is both. Both people and profits are of equal importance to a company, and there is no need to compromise the health of one to maximize the well-being of the other. Now that we’ve cleared up this common misunderstanding, let’s take a closer look at what sort of values you’ll need to implement in order to make significant profits while improving relations with employees. Firstly, boosting your profits means adopting the values of operational excellence. Implementing operational excellence as a leader involves increasing your business revenues over time, ensuring your products are superior to the competition’s, creating as much value as you can for your clients and customers, and consistently recruiting and retaining talented employees. If you can get all of these things right and stick like glue to these business principles, profits are sure to follow. Now let’s take a look at the other side of the coin. What are the values you need to implement to ensure you’re also looking after the people who are involved with your business? These can be people directly involved, such as your employees, or indirectly, as in the wider community. In other words, how can you start being a hero to those around you? The first step is to understand that the best leaders don’t try to go it alone. Instead, they’re open to collaborating with everyone around them who has something valuable to contribute, no matter who they are or where they come from. For instance, heroic leaders will take the time to truly listen to the people around them and won’t hesitate to admit when they’re wrong, or when someone they manage knows more than they do. Heroic leaders seek out many different perspectives on the challenges their company faces, and they try to bring diversity to the decision-making process. In practice, this means including people of different genders, ethnicities and even generations. For instance, if you’re a baby boomer leader, seek out the opinions of millennials, and if you’re a millennial start-up whiz kid, don’t be afraid to seek the advice of someone a little older than you. It’s important for leaders to have values, but it’s even more important that they live them too. After all, what good is it telling others, and yourself, that you value something, if you’re not actually putting that value into practice in your everyday work life? The author witnessed this disconnect between espousing values and living them in his own company. When one of his digital media employees said in a meeting that she had achieved a 60 percent open rate on a batch of email newsletters she’d sent to the company’s clients, the author was shocked. After all, these clients were paying to receive these emails and thus should have been considering them interesting enough to open and read. The author eventually realized that the biggest issue was that the employee wasn’t concerned by this mediocre outcome. Why? Because they weren’t living the company’s values. Specifically, the company’s core mission to relentlessly deliver results. Here was an employee whose job was to tell their clients about what great values the company had, but they were forgetting to implement these same values in their own work. This got the author thinking, have we all become so wrapped up in telling people our own story and values that we’ve forgotten to live by them? Incredibly, this simple disconnect has threatened to destroy some of the world’s best-loved brands in recent years. Just consider what happened to Starbucks. In May 2018, Starbucks closed 8,000 stores for an afternoon to give all of their staff a training session on racial bias. Why? Because just one month earlier, two African American men were arrested in a Starbucks in Philadelphia, after the manager called the police to report that the men were refusing to leave the premises, even though they were just waiting for a third friend to arrive before making a purchase.   Not only were the manager’s actions racist, but they also went against the company’s explicit values: that Starbucks is a communal space where both paying and non-paying customers can sit, relax and pass the time. While the company had spent years selling this warm and welcoming story about their brand, they had failed to test whether their employees were actually living it. At least one manager wasn’t, and to this day, the phrase ‘getting Starbucked’ is often used as an ironic label to describe the victimization of African Americans. So when you’re telling outsiders about your company’s lofty values, be sure that you’re living up to them too. As a heroic leader, it’s important to build a heroic culture in your workplace – but exactly what does this sort of culture look like in practice? You might assume that an excellent working culture looks like lots of enthusiastic employees, all working long, productive hours while having a great time in each other’s company. However, signs of a heroic culture might be a lot more subtle than that. Consider the following example of great corporate culture that the author witnessed recently, but which a less attuned observer might have missed. The author was invited to tour the campus of High Point University, a college in North Carolina. Up until 2005, this college was struggling to attract students, secure funding and find resources. However, this all changed when new President Nido Qubein took over. Within a few short years, he nearly quadrupled the student body, from 1450 students to over 4000, increased annual funding from $38 million to nearly $290 million and took the number of buildings owned by the university from 22 to 112. But this impressive turnaround wasn’t the example of heroic culture that the author remembers from his visit. It was when one of the Vice Presidents stooped to pick up a candy bar wrapper that someone had left lying around. When he saw this senior executive wordlessly stuff the wrapper in his pocket, the author not only knew, but felt the heroic culture of excellence all around him. It was not part of the Vice President’s job description to pick up litter, nor was there any expectation that he should do so. But still, he did it. Why? Because he truly cared about the campus and keeping it pristine, as well as giving his guests the best possible impression of the place. The lesson to take away from this small deed is that a workplace culture doesn’t need to be loud or showy to be heroic. In fact, it’s the everyday examples of individual employees taking personal responsibility and accountability that all add up to make a heroic working environment. These tiny positive behaviors set the mood of a working environment, and, when carried out by those in leadership positions, they inspire everyone else to strive for excellence in every little thing that they do. January 15th, 2009. Flight 1549 had only been in the air for two minutes when flames started shooting out from one of its engines. What happened next shocked and amazed the world. Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger landed the burning plane in the Hudson river in New York. After the crash landing, one of the passengers Dave Sanderson quickly found himself waist-deep in cold water. After a terrifying few minutes, he managed to get out of the plane and swim to a boat. He was taken to the hospital, treated for hypothermia and kept in overnight. Amazingly, the very next day, Sanderson went into his workplace straight from the hospital to let his colleagues know he was fine. His boss’s first words to him when he arrived? “Are you going to Michigan next week?” Sanderson was shocked. How could his boss be so unconcerned about what he’d just been through? Unfortunately, the answer is simple. His boss was part of an unheroic and wholly uncaring workplace culture. As this shocking incident demonstrates, Sanderson’s boss, and the company at large, didn’t see him as a person with whom they had an important relationship. Instead, they simply saw him as a tool through which they achieved financial success. This was why they instantly asked about Michigan because they knew Sanderson was on the brink of making a deal there. Two words – relationships and transactions – make all the difference between a heroic working culture and a toxic one. Heroic cultures are focused on the relationships they have with their employees and clients, and unheroic ones are solely concerned with transactions. Just consider how differently US Airways, the flight operator, treated Sanderson. They went out of their way to care for him and the other passengers during the aftermath of the crash, even assigning him to a personal liaison assistant to help him get back on track. The result? Sanderson is a fan of the airline for life and a loyal customer despite his ordeal. But his employer, the one that didn’t give a damn? Sanderson, a top-performing employee, no longer works for them, and he has nothing good to say about them. This just goes to show that a heroic working culture can bring you lasting loyalty, but an unheroic one can lead to an exodus of valuable employees. Heroic leaders exist in all walks of life, but the impact some of them can have is remarkable. When Rob Ryan founded Ascend Communications in 1989, he couldn’t have predicted that in just ten short years, he would sell his company to the tune of $20 billion. But when he did, Ryan’s life went on just as before. He ate lunch in the same place, and he drove the same car. In fact, the only big difference was to the lives of the people around him. How? He made them all millionaires. When he sold his company, Ryan ensured that everyone who had helped him achieve his staggering success was duly rewarded. Instead of keeping that $20 billion to himself, he set aside 10 percent of the money for his employees. And he didn’t only reward the executives who worked for him; he made millionaires of secretaries and janitors as well. The author often tells the story of Ryan’s generosity when he’s persuading others of the values of heroic leadership. Another example that he shares with his listeners is that of Hamdi Ulukaya, an entrepreneur who founded the successful yogurt company Chobani in 2005. Like Ryan, Ulukaya understood the value of giving back to his employees. When he founded his business, he told his workers straight off the bat that his plan was to share up to 10 percent of the firm’s sale price with them if it was ever sold or became a public company. Nowadays, Chobani is worth $1.5 billion and 2000 of the employees who work there are poised to become millionaires if the company is ever sold. Ulukaya never framed his generosity as a gift. Instead, he told his employees that he was making a pact with them and that they would all stick together, with everyone taking the responsibility to create a business with real value and longevity. In other words, Ulukaya, like Ryan, wanted to empower the people around him. This is the true value of heroic leadership: it’s not about handouts or being nice for the sake of being nice. Instead, being a heroic leader means gathering those around you and giving enough back to them so that they too can reach their full potential and get their share of the fruits of their labor. The key message in these blinks: Heroic leaders aren’t solely focused on profits and transactions. Instead, they also understand that it’s people who make these things possible, and they are what truly makes an organization thrive. By sharing their good fortunes, being open to the perspectives of others and living their organizational values instead of just preaching them, leaders can start giving back to their workers and build strong relationships that help everyone excel.  Actionable advice: Heroic generosity is all relative. Unsurprisingly, the stories about generous billionaire entrepreneurs get the most media attention. But even if you and your company are miles outside the Fortune 500, you can still participate in heroic generosity. Remember, it’s all relative. If you’re a business owner with multi-million dollar profits and you give your ten employees a $50 bonus every year, you’re probably not winning any prizes for heroism. But if you’re a struggling entrepreneur, without the funds for financial rewards, your team will likely appreciate the occasional free coffee or a one-to-one session with you where you take the time to appreciate their achievements. Why? Because you’re giving as much as you can and being generous with your time. In other words, you’re being heroic. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Robinson and Dean M. Schroeder","summary":"What should be the driving force behind any enterprise? If you said “profits,” you’re not alone. Yet how do you achieve a stellar balance sheet? Should you be a ruthless corporate shark, or perhaps an organizational mastermind? None of the above! The real key to success is the ability to come up with great ideas. The organizations that know how to do this are the ones that crush the competition every time. While this might seem obvious, coming up with great ideas is easier said than done. These blinks will show you how you can unlock the creativity in your company and innovate not only constantly but superbly. And importantly, you’ll learn how your great ideas will keep your competitors at bay and profits rolling in. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why clothing producer Zara is more nimble than Italian fashion houses; why drilling holes into the floor of a bar increased profits and employee satisfaction; and why a 26-minute break for Swedish truck builders makes them more productive. Business managers and executives often fall into the too-easy trap of thinking that, from their perch at the top, they have a clear picture of what their organization needs to succeed. But of course, this assumption is wrong! Front-line employees are the people who deal with customer frustrations, problems and wishes  face-to-face and on a daily basis. Managers in contrast rely on focus groups and market research. While such research is often sophisticated, there’s no substitute for daily customer interaction. Building strategy around real-life insights into customer satisfaction can make a huge difference. That’s exactly what Clarion-Stockholm, a four-star hotel, discovered when it enlisted its employees in developing new ideas based on what they saw as pressing customer needs. Sure, adding organic cocktails to a drinks menu might not seem like a major brainstorm, but when you implement small things aimed to make customers happy, these positive changes can have a snowball effect. Think about it: happy customers not only spend more money, but also are far more likely to tell their friends about a great experience. What’s more, happier customers in turn mean employees are more productive! Hotel bar staff at the Clarion-Stockholm were responsible for emptying bottle bins every hour during busy periods. This task not only took them away from customers, but also was tedious and dirty. To improve the situation, the team came up with an ingenious solution. They drilled holes in the bar floor, and installed tubes that led directly into recycling bins in the basement. Bar staff could then toss bottles down the tubes without missing a beat at the bar! As a result, employees were happy, more time was dedicated to customers, and overall sales grew. As we’ve learned, implementing employee-generated ideas is your best chance of satisfying customers. But why do so many companies fail in this respect? The answer lies with traditional managerial attitudes. Unfortunately, when managers rise to the top, they often lose respect for those below them. This observation was confirmed through research; scientists at Stanford University found that many managers believe they are somehow superior to employees lower down on the food chain. This kind of attitude is the natural byproduct of a traditional organizational hierarchy. Unlike other employees, managers typically wear suits, work in private offices and receive higher pay. Everything about this promotes the idea that managers are somehow “better” than their subordinates. Yet this attitude is ultimately detrimental to an idea-driven organization. So what can your company do to implement a different kind of managerial culture, encouraging ideas from the bottom-up? When you hire or promote a manager, look for a person who possesses two crucial personal attributes: You want a humble manager, or someone who won’t hold their subordinates at arm’s length or feels she is somehow better than her employees. And you also want a good listener, someone who will always consider employee opinions and seek out great ideas. And once you’ve hired the right manager, make sure she understands and is engaged in all that happens on the front lines! One of Toyota’s core managerial concepts is “going to the gemba.” Gemba is a Japanese word that refers to the actual place where the real work is done. All of Toyota’s managers and employees operate under the assumption that everything that really matters to the company happens at the gemba, so they focus their attention on making what happens at the gemba run more efficiently! Although it’s crucial to hire managers who deeply engage with front-line staff, you won’t get anywhere if you don’t have a streamlined organization. A simple, three-pronged approach will help you transform your company into an efficient machine. First, eliminate needless bureaucracy. If the process for fixing a simple computer problem involves sending a memo to the IT manager first, then running the request by accounting, your company is too bureaucratic. Cut the red tape and give staff the power to make their own decisions whenever possible. If management needs to get involved, ensure too that the process is transparent and predictable. That way decisions can be made quickly and implemented as soon as possible. Second, establish clear, understandable goals. Too often, managers use incomprehensible jargon when speaking with front-line staff, which is confusing, and worse, can be discouraging. For example, you’ll no doubt baffle an employee working in your hotel’s laundry facility if you asked him to propose methods for streamlining and making efficiencies. However, if you instead talked about ways to save energy or water, you might actually get results. And finally, make it easy for different departments to work together. Clothing retailer Zara has built a nimble organization, consisting of a bunch of three-person teams. Each team (a designer, a commercial manager and a country supervisor) can design, prototype, manufacture and deliver new items to thousands of stores worldwide in just 15 days. Compared to the rest of the fashion industry, in which new garments are usually put together over a year or longer, Zara’s process is fast and streamlined. It’s not a serious shock that the main advantage of having an idea-driven organization is the generation of lots of great ideas! And obviously that’s great, as ideas are an investment in the future of your company. But to make sure you’re actually producing ideas, you need to promote innovation within your company. Be patient: employees need time and resources to develop great ideas and implement them. One way to kick start the process is to incorporate “brainstorming time” into the overall work schedule. For example, at the company’s main engine factory in Stockholm, Swedish truck maker Scania shuts down the assembly line for 26 minutes, once a week, to allow departments to hold idea meetings. Furthermore, each team is deliberately overstaffed by two people, to give employees enough time to implement their ideas. As it happens, this resource commitment is a major reason the company has consistently managed to improve overall productivity by a whopping 12 to 15 percent each year. You should also make sure to reward innovation. After all, if you want ideas to be a normal part of the job for your staff, you should treat it like any other aspect of an employee’s job performance. This means you should focus on rewarding ideas during performance reviews and when considering bonuses, merit increases and promotions! So now you have a good sense of how an idea-driven organization operates. Keep reading to find out exactly what it takes to develop, launch and manage the idea process itself. Transforming your company into an idea-driven organization may seem daunting. Luckily there are three easy paths you can follow to get going. One option is to use the Kaizen teian system. In Japanese, kaizen means “improvement” while teain means “suggestion.” This phrase describes a philosophy about how small changes, routinely applied and sustained over a long period of time, lead to significant benefits for a business. Within this framework, all employees, from CEOs to assembly-line workers, play a role in facilitating change. The process is straightforward. An employee speaks out about a problem; the team determines the root causes of the problem; the team considers solutions; the team tests solutions; and the best solutions are implemented and standardized. Then the kaizen teain cycle starts all over again! Another option is the idea meeting process. Employees are prompted to bring “opportunities for improvement” to team meetings, where suggestions can be discussed and then implemented. Say you’re a bartender who thinks your club is understaffed. At the weekly team meeting, you can mention this issue and suggest a solution, such as scheduling more staff. Everyone can discuss and then decide how to resolve the issue. A final option is to use the idea board process. This approach combines idea meetings with a large idea board, allowing staff to collect and process ideas visually. Idea boards are highly effective because their visibility keeps ideas front and center for everyone on a daily basis. Additionally, idea boards create social pressure to complete assigned tasks on time. If an employee is really keen on an idea on the board, he’ll be eager to keep up on its progress. What’s more, if the employee fails to deliver, everyone will know! As soon as you launch your idea system, you’ll see how great ideas start to flood in. Front-line employees know where the problems are, and will jump at the chance to share their thoughts! However, once the obvious problems have been solved, the flood of new ideas may slow to a trickle. At this point, you’ll have to get better at “problem finding,” that is, discovering less obvious ideas. To do this, you can follow two methods: idea activators and idea mining. Idea activators are short training sessions or educational modules that teach people techniques to trigger new ideas on a specific topic. At Subaru Indiana Automotive (SIA), for instance, employees learned the difference between recycling and downcycling. Downcycling occurs when the recycling process reduces the value or quality of the material. True recycling maintains original physical characteristics and level of quality. Armed with this new knowledge, employees generated hundreds of ideas to avoid downcycling. For example, someone suggested getting suppliers to use standardized uncolored plastic for packaging, so different parts could be recycled together without degrading the value of the polymer. Idea mining is the second method for improving your organization’s problem-finding skills. This process relies on the principle that most great ideas contain even more hidden, implicit ideas. Let’s say your hotel invents a new cocktail, and someone suggests that the bar staff should taste test it. A good idea, but one that can be pushed further: Why not get the restaurant staff to taste the cocktail? How about customers, too? In this way, encouraging your employees to dig deeper will reveal new opportunities for continuous improvement. The key message in this book: Promote innovation and creativity at every level of your organization to improve customer satisfaction, boost employee productivity and position your company for phenomenal long-term success.

Many of the inspiring innovations produced recently have been developed by teams of talented people – the Apple iPhone, Pixar’s film Up! and even Wikipedia. If you want to produce something creative and groundbreaking, you too will need a team. But teams are not easy to manage – people can squabble or fall out with each other – thus limiting innovation and stymying productivity. So how can you create an effective team? These blinks describe the three traits every great team player should have and how these traits can be fostered in employees. In these blinks, you’ll also find out why you need employees who do more than they’re told to do; why teams with average players sometimes outperform teams with top talent; and why the way a potential job candidate deals with a receptionist can tell you volumes. Have you ever wondered why a team of all-star soccer players can still consistently lose matches? Such teams can be considered dysfunctional, and there can be five possible reasons for this. First, in a dysfunctional team, team members might not care about the team’s overall results, as each member is too focused on personal success. A star player might be so determined to score a goal that he refuses to pass the ball to a teammate ready to take a shot. As a result, the team as a whole misses a chance to score. Second, members of dysfunctional teams may lack accountability. This means that the team doesn’t call its individual members out for mistakes, such as a player showing up late or even hungover to practice. This attitude lowers the team’s standards overall, as members see it’s acceptable not to give their best. Third, dysfunctional teams struggle with committing to collective decisions. If a soccer team decides on a strategy but one player does his own thing during a match regardless, the strategy falls flat and the team fails. Fourth, dysfunctional teams often suffer from a fear of conflict. When team members avoid necessary conversations or debates, issues fester and the potential for conflict grows. Finally, dysfunctional teams are marked by an absence of trust. When a team member distrusts the team as a whole, that member will hide weaknesses, avoiding asking for help even when needed. In turn, a member who hides weaknesses won’t be trusted by other team members, either. So how can you avoid the pitfalls of dysfunctional teams when building an organization? Great teams are made of team players. A bad team player can disrupt not only the work of an entire group but also an entire company – just like that soccer player who refuses to get on board with the team strategy. Employees with good social skills and who are driven workers – the team players you should cultivate and reward – won’t stick around if your team is ineffective or even hostile. Thus you need to be proactive by hiring team players, coaching dysfunctional staff and letting go of those employees who won’t change. But how can you ensure you have the right people on your team? Let’s explore the three traits for which you need to keep an eye out in current and potential employees. Let’s say you’ve found a potential new employee with an impressive work history, but you’re wondering whether she’s a solid team player. To determine this, be on the lookout for three key virtues. Remember that all three are essential to the success of your prospective hire! The first virtue of a team player is hunger. Hungry potential employees are always in search of more: more achievement, more learning and more responsibility. These types of people do way more than what is expected because they’re driven and passionate about their work. Conversely, there are employees who only do what’s necessary. You can’t begrudge people like this, since they aren’t technically doing anything wrong – but they will hold your team back. When you assemble a team of hungry people, you’ll never need to push them since they’ll already be self-motivated and attentive. As a result, this team will automatically think ahead and spot opportunities. For instance, an average soccer team can prevail against teams with more individual star players as long as the team is united in its hunger to win. Hungry players will train extra hard and push their limits constantly! Yet while it’s easy to identify a hungry worker, inspiring hunger in others isn’t as simple. You can of course easily identify employees who could stand to be a little more hungry, by observing and measuring individual commitment – such as looking at the hours put in at the office and general output. But even when you identify such workers, you’ll struggle to make them hungry. It’s difficult to change someone against their will, and the fact is, many employees don’t want to be hungry. Quite simply, some workers realize that it’s to their benefit to be un-hungry. Just consider how an employee happy to maintain the status quo enjoys more free time and less stress than a hungrier peer. Yet in rare cases, hungry colleagues can “infect” and inspire less motivated coworkers. But there are two more traits that will help you identify your ideal team player: let’s explore them now. Having a crew of hungry employees is essential, but you’ll also need team players who are smart. Please note though that being smart isn’t the same as being intelligent! In the context of teamwork, smart means having social skills, or the ability to get along with people and to work with them efficiently and effectively. Smart refers to a person’s capacity for interpersonal awareness – that is, their ability to act appropriately in a range of scenarios and understand both group dynamics and individual personalities. Smart employees tend to know what teammates are feeling during a meeting. Smart employees also communicate and listen well, ask great questions and are fully engaged in a conversation. While it’s not challenging to list the traits of a smart person, sometimes it is easy to overlook a worker who isn’t smart. This is important because if you do catch such people, you can help them change. Many people hide a lack of social skills behind technical know-how, a humble nature or insatiable hunger for success. Such employees might not recognize this weakness, but once they do, they can change it. In fact, these people often feel unhappy because they can tell that they don’t belong in a group. So if you want to retain these workers, you need to offer them the assistance they need. Luckily, most will embrace such an opportunity, spurred on by their unhappiness at not “fitting in.” But why is smartness so essential to a team? Simply put, smart team members are less likely to exhibit any of the five dysfunctions that we explored earlier, traits that keep a team from achieving its best. For example, good social skills help a worker build trust by empathizing with others. Team players don’t shy away from healthy conflict since they know how to negotiate without being overly aggressive or negative. In other words, being personable and attentive is key to managing a team – and without positive social skills, teamwork just isn’t possible. Do you feel that your supervisor deserves your respect – but not the office intern? If so, you could use a dose of humility. Great team players are almost always humble individuals. These team players don’t pay too much attention to status or ego, focusing instead on the welfare of the team as a whole. For instance, a humble person will be quick to point out the contributions that other members make and define success collectively, strengthening team spirit. But team players also know that everyone on the team deserves respect, regardless of individual status. Someone who isn’t humble can be disruptive to a team’s overall psyche. Such an employee might compete with other members for attention, resenting it when someone else is the center of the group’s focus. Naturally, this behavior disturbs a group’s cohesive feel. Let’s look at an example. Our team is brainstorming a new product name, and one team member offers a perfect suggestion. Problem solved! But wait – while most of the team is applauding the idea, another team member is jealously criticizing it and still suggesting alternatives, trying to regain the spotlight. When keeping an eye out for workers who lack humility, remember that this trait often shows up as the first dysfunction – caring more about one’s status than the goals of the team. Remember the soccer player, who only thinking of himself, refused to do the right thing for the team by passing the ball? So while being humble is about supporting team members, it’s also about being unpretentious and refraining from gloating about one’s humility. After all, people who are so eager to appear humble are often quite the opposite! Real humility means you care for others before yourself. A lack of humility can become glaring in simple ways – consider a person who strives to appear unassuming and humble during a job interview but, in an arrogant slip, fails to thank the receptionist on the way out. Nobody enjoys job interviews. It’s an awkward process; more often than not, a nervous interviewee will try to tell his prospective employers exactly what they want to hear and not what they need to hear. So how can you tell if a candidate is the team player for whom you’re looking? First, keep an eye out for the three virtues of a team player – or crucially, the absence of those virtues. For instance, try to detect if the candidate is humble by paying attention to whether he thanks the secretary for the coffee he is served. Remember that smart people tend to know themselves well. They’ll easily answer when asked for four adjectives that best describe their personality. And to find out if someone is hungry, ask the person if he worked hard in high school or was involved in competitive sports. Both are strong indicators of a hungry individual. It’s also essential to test a candidate, by explaining that the behavior of everyone in your company is held to account. This will deter candidates who lack the necessary hunger or who believe they wouldn’t be able to meet the demands of the team. And remember, you’ll learn more about a candidate if you interview them with a team or at least discuss the one-on-one interview with others. It’s likely that other people will catch things that you miss. It pays to have your team present for an interview; afterward, you can ask members for their thoughts, to make sure a candidate displayed the three virtues. In a team interview setting, you’ll also learn how a candidate deals with multiple people at once, telling you a thing or two about the person’s smartness. So if you decide to let team members conduct one-on-one interviews with the candidate instead, the team should meet after every session to discuss the candidate’s virtues or lack thereof, and decide what to focus on next. You probably have plenty of valuable employees in your company, but how can you turn these individuals into great team players? You can start by searching for the three virtues among current staff. Come up with some criteria for each virtue, and ask yourself how many of these are present in any given employee. Beyond this, you should also have employees do a self-evaluation, in which specific questions work to highlight the virtues for which you’re looking. For instance, you could ask an employee to describe a situation in which he exhibited smarts, or have the employee reflect on whether he deals well with conflict, in or out of the office. The next step is to help employees build the virtue or virtues they lack. After all, almost anyone can develop these virtues if they want to – you don’t have to be born hungry or smart. Most employees do want to improve once attention is drawn to an issue that is lacking. Your process should include letting employees know what they should do to develop virtues through timely and constructive feedback. You could alert an employee to a situation in which he’s addressed a coworker in an inappropriate way, for example, and praise other workers as they make progress. But remember, if a worker is resistant to change, that individual may have to be let go. Finally, embed the three virtues into your company’s culture. Not every company needs to be built on teamwork. Yet if you do choose this path, it’s essential to drill the three virtues into your employees. Company managers must be bold and explicit, calling out people when they violate a virtue, identifying examples of the virtues in practice and praising employees for exhibiting them – for instance, praising an employee for his hunger in staying up all night to fix a software bug. Finally, remember that managers must be good role models, by displaying positive team player virtues, too! The key message in this book: Every team player has three virtues: a hunger to go above and beyond, the social smarts to interact positively with a group and the humility to subsume the ego for the team’s common good. If even one of these traits is lacking in a single team member, your whole team will suffer.  Actionable Advice: Don’t talk about flaws, talk about change. When you approach an employee about a trait he lacks, present the issue as an opportunity to change. Tell the employee that everyone can improve, and you are there to help. This way, the worker will focus less on the trait that is lacking and more on the overall process of improvement. People really can change, but doing so requires hard work – which a person will pursue only if he believes the goal is feasible. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

This is usually viewed as an ethical problem, but what if it’s also a business problem? What if a lack of inclusion is actually bad for your bottom line? In The Inclusion Dividend the authors show how biases and a lack of inclusion influences more parts of business than we might think. They also provide us with ideas and programs to tackle the issues and create a more inclusive environment that isn’t only good for employees, but also good for business. In these blinks, you’ll discover why MIT professor Sendil Mullainathan sent out 5,000 applications for jobs; how Apple extended its inclusion program to vendors; and why two million of America’s best and brightest left their jobs in 2007. Have you ever had the disappointing experience of putting in long hours and being the best in your workplace, only to discover that success doesn’t always boil down to hard work? That’s because while the idea of meritocracy is deeply engrained in the business world, it might not be the reality.  But what is a meritocracy exactly? It’s the long-held belief that hard work will be rewarded. In fact, it’s even the basis of the American Dream – the idea that anyone can reap the benefits of a rewarding and comfortable life by putting in the necessary work.  So, if you asked a board member of a Fortune 1000 company whether their corporation abides by a meritocratic system they would naturally say yes. They would maintain that employees are hired, promoted and kept on board solely on account of their abilities.  Unfortunately, this claim doesn’t quite align with reality. For instance, in the United States, about half the population is female, but a census conducted in 2010 by Catalyst found that women only accounted for 15% of all executive positions at Fortune 500 companies. When women were asked why they thought this was, they said the problem was due to a lack of opportunities for promotion and respect. So, now you know a meritocratic system doesn’t exist, but did you know that low diversity is actually bad for business? Just consider the fact that global corporations spend about $8 billion annually to foster a more inclusive corporate culture. They don’t just do it to avoid discrimination lawsuits, but because it makes them money.  For instance, take the companies listed on Standard and Poor’s 500 stock index. They’re profitable companies that brought in an 89% return on their investments over a three-year period. But the S&P corporations that also made it onto Working Mother’s 100 top companies for inclusion brought back 98% on every dollar invested! Have you ever been left wondering why you didn’t land an interview even though your application was loads better than your competitor’s? You might have been a victim of unconscious bias.  What’s that? Well, bias is an ever present human characteristic that’s hard to avoid; it’s a prejudice that you hold against other things or people. For instance, you might be biased toward thinking your home sports team is the best because you grew up rooting for them, even though you know they’re not so great.  Biases help you navigate the world by allowing you to rapidly react based on instinct. But while having an opinion without conscious thought is helpful for simple decisions, it can also have negative impacts, especially if you’re unaware of your biases.  Which brings us to unconscious biases: the judgments you make about others without being aware of why. For instance, an employee might earn a promotion simply because he went to the same college as his boss. The boss might not consciously intend to make choices this way –  he might just have positive associations with his alma mater.  But unconscious biases can cause bigger problems when they spur behavior that influences the workplace. That’s because biases don’t just affect your thoughts, they affect your actions too. For example, the MIT professor Sendil Mullainathan conducted a study in which he sent out about 5,000 resumés for 1,300 jobs.  The goal was to determine whether highly skilled applicants would receive differential treatment simply based on changing their names. So, while one group of applications bore names that sounded Caucasian, the names of another group sounded African American. Here are the results. For one, the white-sounding applicants had a 50% higher chance of landing an interview in general, but were also more likely to get an interview than highly skilled applicants with names that sounded African American. It was even true for companies making an active effort to diversify. So, unconscious bias might go against your intentions and cause you to miss out on great opportunities, like hiring star employees.  Most people are right handed and few right-handers ever consider what life is like for their left-handed peers – everything from can openers to tape measures are awkward to use. It’s just one example, but being unaware of more common differences exacerbates insider-outsider dynamics. What’s that? Well, every team within a greater organization is divided into insider-outsider groups based on any number of factors like age, sex, class, what college you attended and even where you grew up. As a result of these groupings, a power dynamic emerges in which the people in the insider group dominate those in the outsider group, in other words, those who are different.  For instance, a common inside group in many companies is comprised of men who attended Ivy league schools. Members of this group are more likely to give orders and tend to have more say in company decisions than women or people who didn’t graduate from an Ivy League university.  The issue is that being unaware of insider-outsider dynamics can cause imbalances in the workplace. For example, say a meeting is held in which female employees brainstorm some great ideas, but their genius is overshadowed by their male peers who disproportionately engage with one another.  Failing to address such power dynamics won’t just cost you brilliant ideas, it will also render your workforce unstable and dissatisfied. That’s because strong insider dynamics result in both decreased productivity and creativity. For instance, someone in the outside group might understand an issue better than anyone else on their team but be powerless to make productive changes. Just think of trying to break into a female-dominated market. The women on staff would be best equipped with the necessary knowledge but if they’re disempowered their suggestions will fall on deaf ears.  Another issue is that unfair power dynamics cost companies highly skilled employees. For example, a study published in 2007 by the Level Playing Institute discovered that two million professionals who were not white, heterosexual men, quit their jobs every year as a result of such power dynamics. So, a lack of diversity is bad for your company, but you can change that by looking within your firm as well as beyond it.  How? By using an Inclusion Initiative Phases or IIP model, a technique the authors developed for ensuring long-term, sustainable inclusion at any organization.  Here’s how it works. The program is comprised of four phases designed to increase the diversity and inclusivity of your company. The four steps build a structure through which any company can forge their own path to inclusion, and it’s easy to get started: Phase one is called Research and Needs Identification. In this phase you’ll gather information through employee engagement surveys, focus groups and interviews to better understand your staff.  Phase two is Strategy Creation, and to build a good strategy you need strong data, a clear path to profitability, and finally, a realistic plan for implementation. In the best scenario you’ll have a diverse team overseeing the process from start to finish.  Phase three is Implementation and Integration, a time to put your strategy into direct action. The key to this phase is to ensure that your employees don’t view the activities they’re made to participate in as a burden.  In Phase four you’ll conduct Measurement and Re-calibration to constantly evaluate what works best about the other phases, especially number three. Once you know what techniques are most effective you should amplify them while letting go of those that failed.  What will you gain by doing all this? Well, when inclusivity increases the impact isn’t just felt in the office. It also affects the ways you can market your company. That’s because customers are the most important aspect of any business venture and in many ways reflect the companies they buy from.  For instance, business research commonly shows a correlation between the experience of employees and that of customers. Therefore, if you only employ white men, you’re likely to only have white male customers. On the other hand, a diverse company will have more diverse customers and be more successful! So you’re ready to make your company more inclusive, but it won’t happen without some effort. While inclusivity is a group effort, it’s best implemented from the top down, and to change their business, company leaders need to change themselves.  That’s because growth in the modern era means reaching a global market that’s both diverse and complex. To do so you’ll need to develop interpersonal relationships with all kinds of people. For instance, Apple embraced inclusion to this end. In 1993 their executives expanded their pre-existing diversity programs by adding a supplier diversity initiative, which required the company’s suppliers to also adhere to certain diversity standards.  The result? In 2011 Apple was bringing in the largest profit per employee of any company in the world, with each employee generating $400,000 a year. Not just that, but because the inclusivity encompasses program employees, vendors and suppliers, Apple is one of the most successful brands today! So a company won’t change unless the people in charge also change, and business leaders can reap big rewards by challenging themselves in diversity. For instance, one technique is to audit oneself, a process that requires you to take a good look at your own biases. Because while turning a critical eye on your prejudices and relationships can be uncomfortable, it will help you build relationships with people different from yourself, just as Apple did with its suppliers. In fact, adopting an inclusive style of leadership can even build a real meritocracy. That’s because every leader can make the meritocracy they desire more of a reality by critically examining the company’s culture. For instance, bosses should pay more attention to company taboos like the informal relationships and unspoken agreements between employees. The culture at any company is mainly a product of the leadership, so if a leader acknowledges the absence of a real meritocracy and goes as far as challenging his or her own unconscious biases, the commitment to inclusion is likely to affect the rest of the company. The key message in this book: It’s a struggle to find instances of true meritocracy among companies today, and there’s much to be done before the playing field can be considered level for employees. The good news is that increased diversity and inclusion can ensure equality in a workplace while also boosting the profitability of any business.  Actionable advice: Keep your biases in mind the next time you’re recruiting. The next time you’re conducting an interview pay attention to any prejudices you might hold toward the prospective employee. Are your biases causing you to write them off despite their stellar qualifications? Don’t let your predispositions cost you the top talent your company needs!

You’ll be facing a fast-approaching deadline while coworkers seem to be lined up at your desk vying for attention, and the number of unread emails in your inbox is reaching staggering new heights. It all seems like more than any one person can possibly manage! Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to reclaim peace of mind – and, while you’re at it, increase productivity. While finding ways of working undisturbed can be part of the solution, as author Bruce Daisley makes clear, there is a less intuitive part of productivity: the social aspect.  Yes, we need to block out distractions while we work, but there are limits to how much time we should spend working before the harmful effects of exhaustion set in. Plus, what we do when we take our much-needed breaks can also have a tremendous impact on our well-being and overall efficiency. In these blinks you’ll find how to get a productive day started before 11:00 a.m.; why you may want to take your next meeting outdoors; and why it’s important to laugh, even when things are grim. If you’ve worked in an office, you may have had bosses or company executives that would stay hidden away in her office for hours on end. Perhaps you even thought poorly of them for being so detached and unsociable. However, if we look at the reasons behind good working habits, those aloof bosses may have been onto something. For starters, keeping your workspace free of distractions is a key component to working efficiently. In 2011, Danish management researcher J.H. Pejtersen conducted a study that revealed how people working in open-plan office spaces tended to take more sick days than workers who have private offices. The study also showed that those working in an open office space tend to be interrupted from their work on an average of once every three minutes. These breaks in concentration aren’t just due to colleagues popping over to ask you a question – they also take the form of distracting conversations coming from neighboring desks and cubicles. What makes these interruptions so bad for your efficiency is that once your concentration is broken, it takes a long time for you to get back to that same level of focus. This is the same reason why you shouldn’t try to juggle too many tasks at the same time. In his book Quality Software Management, the computer scientist Gerald Weinberg found that software managers who tried to jump between five different projects during the same day would only manage to work at a quarter of the efficiency they’d have achieved if they stuck to one project at a time. One excellent way of reducing distractions is to practice the Monk Mode Morning, which involves shutting out all incoming calls and visitors until 11:00 a.m. At first, your office mates may not appreciate this distraction barricade, but if you explain that it isn’t about being antisocial, but rather an attempt to put in a few hours of uninterrupted work before engaging with phone calls and meetings, then they’ll likely understand.  If Monk Mode Morning sounds appealing but you don’t have an office door to enforce it, you can try using headphones until 11:00 a.m. in order to create your own space. If you’re feeling stuck with a creative task, especially one with a quickly approaching deadline, you may not feel like stepping away from your work to go for a stroll. Yet, as J.K. Rowling, author of the world-famous Harry Potter books says, “There’s nothing like a night-time stroll to give you ideas.” As it turns out, Rowling’s claim about the creative benefits of going for a walk are supported by science. In a 2014 study by two Stanford psychologists, Marily Oppezzo and Daniel Schwartz, participants were asked for creative responses to certain scenarios. For instance, coming up with uses for a key that is shaped like an eye. Some responses were considered uncreative, like using the key as an artificial eye. A highly creative response was for the key to be used by a murder victim to carve the name of their killer into the floor. After testing participants who either sat still or; got up, went for a walk and sat back down, 81 percent of those who took a stroll were found to be more creative with their answers. According to the researchers, the act of walking reinvigorated the participants’ thinking and led to better ideas. Oppezzo and Schwartz also found that it helped to sit back down afterward and concentrate in order for the ideas to flourish. One way of fitting more productive walks into your routine is to have a stroll while you’re conducting a meeting. Productivity expert and coach Chris Barez-Brown encourages his clients to go for walks with another person. During this time, one person is allowed to talk about a pressing issue without interruption for up to 30 minutes. Then, the two people switch roles and, for the rest of the walk, the other person gets to talk.  By walking with this purpose, you’ll both energize your thoughts by allowing each other to say whatever comes to mind without censoring or correcting each other. Barez-Brown has seen this work wonders for his clients, who often come back from their walks with added clarity and exciting ideas. It’s common to feel like you’re in a rush or under pressure to get things done, but did you know that having a persistent level of stress can affect your behavior?  Just think of those times when you’ve been waiting for the elevator and feel the need to keep pressing the call button again and again, even though you know it won’t make the elevator arrive any faster. This is a typical example of what’s known as hurry anxiety. Essentially, hurry anxiety is characterized by a constant low-grade stress due to the feeling that you’ll never be able to finish all that you want to accomplish. Hurry anxiety is especially common these days thanks to the level of connectivity and abundance of information that the internet age provides. For example, according to a 2015 study by the Radicati Group, which looked at the daily habits of 2.8 billion workers worldwide, the average person responds to 130 emails during a typical day. And these emails are just the tip of the iceberg! In his 2011 book, The Organized Mind, social scientist Daniel Levitin revealed that the average American worker processed around 100,000 words of information every day – which is five times more than what workers processed in 1986. Given all the tasks we hope to tick off and information we need to process, is it any wonder we feel constantly overwhelmed?  Well, fortunately for us, there are steps you can take to lessen those levels of anxiety. One of the important things to realize is that being constantly busy isn’t the same as being productive. In fact, instead of striving to be busy, you can be more productive by setting aside time in your daily schedule for doing nothing. According to Dr. Sandi Mann, who works at the University of Central Lancashire’s School of Psychology, we’re better at solving problems and coming up with innovative solutions when we engage with our brain’s default network. This is the part of the brain that includes the subconscious. It is when we are at rest and doing absolutely nothing that we can really tap into this source of creativity. So, make sure you include time off during your day when you can take a break from all those incoming messages and emails. And rather than stressing about every email, just focus on responding to the few that are truly urgent. In a 2013 interview, British tennis champion Andy Murray explained just how exhausting a tennis match can be. As he explained it, physical exhaustion is only part of it. A tennis match also results in a great deal of mental exhaustion, due to having to make so many split-second tactical decisions. As Murray’s comments suggest, we are only capable of making so many decisions before we’re left feeling exhausted, which is why there’s a limit to how much work we can do before our productivity begins to suffer. Ultimately, the more decisions we’re asked to make, the more exhausted we become and the more we’ll gravitate toward undemanding tasks.  In a 2008 study, psychologist Kathleen Vohs had participants make a series of decisions, such as which movie, ice-cream flavor or washing detergent was their favorite, or how to solve different problems – most of which were purposefully unsolvable.  In between making decisions, the participants were asked to choose which activities they would rather perform – a challenging activity, like creative writing or studying a new subject, or something easy like watching TV or playing a simple video game. As Vohs discovered, the participants not only showed signs of mental exhaustion early on, but as the level of exhaustion increased, so too did their preference toward less challenging activities. So, the next time you come home from work and can only muster the energy to collapse on the couch and stream the first thing you see on Netflix, this is likely a sign of decision-making mental fatigue. This exhaustion can also have repercussions at work – especially when people ignore these signs of fatigue and continue working. Scott Maxwell used to work for the consultancy company McKinsey, which was the kind of workplace where people would sleep under their desks so they could put in as many hours as possible. Eventually, Maxwell realized that this behavior wasn’t increasing productivity. In fact, after he launched his own venture capitalist company and studied the data, he found that an employee’s productivity routinely declined if they worked over 40 hours a week. So, just because you’re pushing yourself to work more hours, doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing better work. In the long run, by keeping your work under 40 hours a week, you’ll actually be more productive. Have you ever dreamed of having an all-seeing eye and monitoring every worker in your company to see how they’re really spending their time? If the answer is yes, then your dream may already be a reality thanks to the new technology behind sociometric badges. Developed by Alex Pentland, a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sociometric badges combine traditional ID badges with smartphone technology, and make it possible to monitor workplace dynamics. Now, all the data behind an employee’s movements and interactions can be recorded and analyzed to reveal valuable information about individual behavior, such as how much time an employee spends in face-to-face conversations, as well as group behavior. When combined with the data recorded in daily work activity logs, the information captured by sociometric badges can reveal patterns that may relate to increased productivity. For example, when Professor Pentland looked at his own data and activity logs, he could see that his breakthrough ideas were often accompanied by increased time spent talking to his colleagues. In other words, he discovered that the more conversations he had, the more productive he was. Pentland also found that the most productive conversations tended to take place in informal environments, such as an impromptu chat in the hallway or break room. In these places, employees could speak casually and comfortably, giving new ideas the freedom to emerge. In his studies, Pentland looked at employee data from call centers and banks, and found that up to 40 percent of their productivity could be traced back to ideas that were raised during such informal conversations.  So Pentland also came up with ways for companies to better encourage such interactions. He suggested making lunch tables longer so you could get more people sitting next to one another and increase familiarity between coworkers. Additionally, if you wanted to increase communication between two teams at work, Pentland found it highly effective to strategically place a coffee machine or tea kettle between the two groups. Finding the right data to monitor productivity can vary from job to job. But at a call center, the information is pretty straightforward: there, we can easily see the number of calls being made and the success rate of those calls. And because these numbers are so apparent, employees at call centers feel a lot of pressure to spend more time making more calls to boost those numbers. However, this approach isn’t very effective. It may sound counterintuitive, but a better way to boost productivity in a call center is to give people more social breaks. In 2014, Bank of America hired the company Humanyze to help find ways to improve workflow and efficiency. Ben Waber, the CEO of Humanyze, noticed that the employees at the bank’s call center would generally take individual, solitary breaks, so he suggested that employees should take their breaks in pairs. Since the sociometric badges also monitored biometric information, such as the stress levels of the employees, it was revealed that the switch to social breaks decreased stress levels by 19 percent, while increasing productivity by 23 percent. The reason this change made such a big difference is that social interactions can serve to balance out the challenges of work. After all, work is often isolating as well as stressful. For example, in a call center, employees are on their own in having to deal with customers who are often angry, rude or dismissive. To say it can be a dispiriting job is an understatement. Therefore, being able to share their troubles and talk about their difficulties can provide instant relief to a call center employee. And who better to confide in than a colleague who is going through the same ordeal? These social break conversations also make the job easier. A colleague who has been handling calls for years can provide a newcomer with a proven strategy for how to calm down difficult customers, or get skeptical customers to stay on the line. So, making sure that coworkers are taking breaks, and using those breaks to talk to one another, will not only improve productivity – it will also improve their well-being. There’s one group of people who shouldn’t get left out when it comes to the productive benefit of social interaction at the workplace, and that’s the employees who are working remotely. While working from home may make it easier to enter Monk Mode and block out distractions, it doesn’t help when it comes to taking social breaks. While they didn’t announce their reason, the lack of communication between colleagues is likely why Yahoo recently launched a policy that forbade remote work. Yahoo and other companies know that, when employees spend too much time away from company headquarters, it can hurt productivity. According to Ben Waber, CEO at Humanyze, remote workers only exchange a weekly average of 7.8 informal communications with their colleagues, while employees in the office averaged 38 per week. As we discussed in the previous blink, this communication is crucial for both productivity and employee well-being. So, there’s a good reason to have your employees under the same roof. But sometimes, in order to get people to open up and feel comfortable sharing ideas, employees need a social push in the form of a company gathering. When CEO Margaret Heffernan moved from the UK to the US, she noticed that the employees weren’t as open with one another. It was apparent that her new office didn’t have the same upbeat, background hum of conversation between people. One big difference that she picked up on was that her US colleagues didn’t gather after work in the pub like their UK counterparts did. The pub was an informal place where they could wait for the rush hour to subside and get to know one another. As a result, Heffernan launched a weekly social meeting time at the office, every Friday starting at 4:30 p.m. It started off a bit awkwardly, but eventually everyone began to relax and bonding was underway. Indeed, thanks to the weekly meetings, the individual employees became much better team collaborators. For teams to work and be productive, members need to trust and appreciate one another and, for this to happen, they need to bond socially. So informal work gatherings are an ideal place for this to happen – and should therefore be considered a valuable source of productivity. There’s a good chance you laughed a lot more as a child than you do now. Children can be such constant gigglers that they even get on the nerves of more serious adults. But the fact of the matter is, every adult could benefit from more laughter in their lives. As we’ve come to find out, laughing is an effective and valuable way of coping with life’s challenges – even if you’re experiencing the stresses of war.  In 2011, ethnographer Mark de Rond spent weeks embedded with the staff of a US Army hospital in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Remarkably, de Rond found that, even though the staff were forced to deal with hundreds of casualties and numerous deaths every week, they were always quick to laugh and share a joke. Certainly, the humor at the hospital tended to be more morbid than your average workplace, but it nonetheless served as a valuable counterbalance to the death and suffering that surrounded them on a daily basis. According to de Rond and other scientists, laughing is an effective coping strategy for balancing out the intense emotions and situations we face. So, it stands to reason that it can be a valuable practice when dealing with stress at the workplace. What’s more, laughter has also been shown to stimulate creativity. In a recent study at Drexel University, participants were asked to solve various puzzles. Leading up to the puzzle, some participants were shown jokes from comedian Robin Williams’s stand-up routine, while others approached the puzzles without laughter. In the end, those who watched Robin Williams were found to show 20 percent more creativity in solving the puzzles than those who didn’t. Adding more laughter into your day requires the development of a workplace culture where laughter is encouraged. This doesn't mean that everyone has to crack jokes all the time – rather, it’s about approaching work with an openness to sharing laughter with those around you, if the chance arises. A culture that encourages laughter is one where employees have a cheerful perspective on their work life and are willing to share a laugh about it from time to time. Remember, whatever the circumstances of your job may be, there are always opportunities to make it more enjoyable. The key message in these blinks: We need to develop a different work culture. One in which we have time and space in the mornings for working without distraction, for going on inspirational walks and having casual but productive conversations with coworkers. We need to put more emphasis on the social aspects of work by encouraging employees to take social breaks with their colleagues, where they feel free to open up and bond with one another. By working undistracted and being more social in the necessary breaks we take from work, we’ll be both happier and more productive. Actionable advice: Get plenty of sleep. Sleep is probably the easiest way to boost your work performance, and it takes little effort. All you have to do is rest.  Science has shown that enough sleep, typically 8 hours a night, not only improves concentration and performance the next day, but also makes you less likely to cave in to cravings for coffee or sweet treats. Plus, it just makes you happier. According to scientists, sleeping well reduces the amount of negative thoughts floating through your head.  So start tonight! Turn off your computer and refrain from doing anything too stimulating after 9 p.m. Instead, relax and engage in soothing activities until you’re tired enough to lay down to sleep. Chances are, you’ll get a great night’s sleep.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Sutton","summary":"We all have bad days and act like assholes every now and then; we are all temporary assholes occasionally. Certified assholes, on the other hand, are people whose asshole-behavior is not a temporary outburst on a bad day – rather, it is part of their character. These are people whose bad behavior is continuous and long term. This hostile behavior can be expressed both physically and mentally. It may be verbal or non-verbal. Assholes leave their victims angry, afraid, and humiliated. In the workplace, this can be expressed in many ways: Assholes interrupt others while they speak, they violate their personal space, insult and intimidate them, put others down, stare at them aggressively or ignore them altogether. Assholes often get away with this behavior by treating their own bosses or customers respectfully, whilst treating everyone else poorly. Hiding behavior like this can be very effective if lower-level employees feel the asshole’s good reputation with superiors would lead to their complaints being ignored. The general rule is: Assholes is the right term for all those people who regularly bully or put down others. Lots of workplaces tolerate poor behavior without realizing the damage it causes. In offices where assholes go unchallenged, employee morale is undeniably lower than in comparable workplaces which maintain a friendly, respectful and professional atmosphere. This has a huge effect on everybody’s productivity. Employees with low morale are more likely to resign, take more sick leave and are generally less productive. They may get their own back by skipping work, producing poor results, or even stealing. Assholes sap their colleagues’ energy – that goes for onlookers working in a hostile environment as well as direct victims. Assholes in positions of power are particularly damaging. The employees under their management work with the constant threat of humiliation and expend their energy on avoiding it rather than focusing on good work. This quickly leads to a fearful, unproductive atmosphere. Tolerating assholes is therefore a costly mistake for a business. The quality of work goes down as the best employees, who have more options available, leave for asshole-free workplaces. Assholes are bad for business – especially when they hold management positions. All too often assholes are tolerated in the workplace. Their temper tantrums and spitefulness are put down to character flaws and excused because they are talented, smart, or difficult to replace. But in doing so, businesses are effectively hurting themselves; all assholes should be weeded out from the workforce from the very beginning. To put it another way, it makes sense to regard an employee who cannot get along with their colleagues and makes them feel uncomfortable or upset as incompetent, regardless of their other qualities or abilities. This No Asshole Rule should be applied to all, whatever their qualifications. The founders and managers of a business should always make it clear that all their employees deserve to be treated with respect. This pays its own reward in loyalty and high employee morale. Life is too short to put up with assholes. To put this rule into effect, it needs to be well known by all employees. Google’s slogan “Don’t be evil” is a good example of this. The rule should also be extended to customers and clients, as their behavior can have just as much of an effect on job satisfaction and morale as an employee’s. Some airlines, for example, blacklist customers who have mistreated their staff by e.g. screaming at them or threatening them. To create a great working-environment, businesses should adopt the No Asshole Rule. Studies have repeatedly shown that people given higher status are more likely to behave like assholes. They talk more than others, take what they want without considering the people around them; in general they tend to see others just as a means to an end and take personal credit for a group success. One such study had groups of three students discuss various issues. One student per group had been randomly chosen to rate the others’ arguments. The results were that these more powerful students tended to break social conventions more frequently. This was measured by providing a shared plate of cookies; the higher-status students were more likely to take the last cookie, chew with their mouth open and leave more crumbs behind. The same effect is very noticeable in the business world. The greater the difference in status between managers and employees, the more lower-ranking workers are treated disrespectfully. In order to reduce asshole behavior, a business should seek to reduce the social distance between employees. This leads to more respectful behavior, especially between managers and subordinates. One way of doing this is to keep wage differences as narrow as possible. Earnings are the most important sign of status in the business world – by keeping wage gaps as unspectacular as possible, a company can reduce the differences in status that lead to workplace bullying. More equality equals fewer assholes. Every office worker knows that groups of managers can be pretty similar to groups of baboons. There are fierce rivalries between competing managers, and the most aggressive one often wins. The interesting thing is, even though individuals acting aggressive and reckless are often rewarded as cold and unpleasant, but also as competent and resourceful. Being cold and ruthless can be just as much of an advantage in the business world as in the Mafia or a tribe of chimpanzees. This can be explained by evolution; throughout the rise of man, the most aggressive, loudest member of the group became leader. Hence, our brains have evolved to associate aggression with high status. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea for companies to promote assholes to positions of power or to tolerate aggression in the first place. Techniques that work well at outcompeting rivals do not translate well into good management techniques; rather than motivating subordinates, they often have the exact opposite effect. Two things best motivate people: incentives and recognition. Not only do these positive techniques get better results than aggression and punishment – a tyrant’s power only lasts as long as they’re around to enforce it – but they keep office morale high. The best employees, who can more easily find work elsewhere, are less likely to stay in a workplace given a negative atmosphere by tolerance of assholes; the people that stay behind are those that have few other options. Assholes drive away the cream of the workforce, whilst implementing the No Asshole Rule will help to attract and keep talented workers. Being an asshole can be an advantage, but motivating employees through incentives is more effective. The business world is a cut-throat place; competition between firms is fierce and unending. This attitude is all too often carried over into companies’ internal cultures. Naturally, healthy competition between individuals can be good for a company; ambition is a great way to motivate employees to greater efforts, to take risks, and to come up with new ideas. It also helps to select the best candidates for promotion. However, in the scrabble for advancement, rivalries can turn sour and the best interests of the company are easily forgotten. Too much internal competition can effectively hamstring a company and make it an uncivilized, unproductive workplace. This is the reason that the most successful companies are often those in which internal competition is restrained and a culture of co-operation fostered. Not only does this produce a more civilized atmosphere, but also better results. To achieve this, it’s important firstly to note and reward co-operation. Subtle approaches such as choice of vocabulary can have a surprising effect on a company’s culture. Replacing aggressive, often warlike words and phrases (‘the enemy’, ‘battleground’ etc.) with more positive alternatives, stressing co-operation (‘help’, ‘fairness’, ‘community’) can be particularly effective. Even such simple changes such as referring to ‘we’, ‘our’, and ‘us’ rather than ‘I’, ‘my’, and ‘them’ can subconsciously remind employees that they’re all on the same team and direct focus towards co-operation rather than the differences and rivalries that sap time and energy. To create a civilized, productive workplace, focus on cooperation, rather than internal competition. Being an asshole is highly contagious. Just as the proverb says “Lie down with dogs and you’ll rise with fleas,” simply being around angry and aggressive people noticeably alters your mood and behavior. If you find yourself working in a rude and disrespectful culture, you soon get used to rudeness and lack of respect, and gradually come to display both towards others. This behavior also has a way of creeping into private life and so has consequences far beyond the business world. Sutton himself notes how he started treating his wife worse after spending too much time amongst assholes. So to avoid becoming a certified asshole in both your business and private life, avoid assholes as far as possible. Of course, you can’t always choose your co-workers, so if avoiding assholes isn’t an option, try to keep contact to a minimum to keep your exposure as low as possible. It helps to think of being an asshole as a virus – you’d avoid close contact with a colleague who has the flu, so treat assholes the same way. Of course, it’s always easier to do something from the start than it is to change course later on. If you’ve already invested a lot of time and energy into a relationship with an asshole, it’s going to be more difficult to distance yourself from them. Hence, whenever you face an asshole, get off as quickly as possible! Avoid assholes or you’ll become one yourself. In many workplaces it’s impossible to completely avoid contact with assholes. Working with, or worse, under an asshole can be very demoralizing, even if you don’t realize at first how much stress it actually causes, so it’s very important to have a good strategy to allow you to get through the day unscathed. Generally, the most important thing is not to let an asshole drag you down to his level. It’s difficult, but try to remain calm, don’t respond to aggression with more aggression, and keep as much distance as possible between yourself and any hurtful things being said. It may help to remind yourself that the person you’re dealing with is just an asshole, no matter how senior they may be. To build emotional distance, treat interactions with known assholes with a positive frame of mind. Remember: The problem is only temporary. You’re not the cause of the problem. It’s not going to ruin the rest of your life. If somebody’s an asshole, that’s their problem, not yours. Anticipating an uncomfortable situation with an asshole, it’s helpful to always hope for the best whilst preparing for the worst. Happiness (and sadness) is found in the difference between what you expect and what you experience. So when dealing with an asshole, be prepared for the worst, but remember that it’s due to the other person and not you. Don’t let assholes get to you – build emotional distance. Everyone knows that it only takes one asshole to ruin a conversation, whether in the office, at a party or just in everyday life. Even if everyone else is behaving normally, one asshole can spoil the mood. Negative things affect our mood five times more than positives, meaning that meeting five nice people who compliment you and bring you good news might easily be neutralized by encountering one single asshole. So, everyone should know about and apply the No Asshole Rule, in both their professional and private lives. This means, zero tolerance for assholes. That said, it’s also important to avoid becoming an asshole yourself, or if you already are, to try to change negative behavior. The first step is to take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself when was the last time you acted like an asshole. In fact the way to avoid being an asshole is simple; be friendly and respectful to other people at all times, and expect the same treatment in return. Because life’s too short to put up with assholes. Everyone should use the No Asshole Rule all the time. The key message in this book is: Companies should have a zero tolerance policy towards assholes and bad behavior. This raises employee morale, productivity and company loyalty. The book answers the following questions: How do you spot an asshole, and what harm do they cause? Assholes is the right term for all those people who regularly bully or put down others.

We make decisions based on what we can get out of a situation, often with little regard for how others fair. However, concentrating on what we each want all the time causes many problems; instead, we should focus on what others want. Imagine you are a manager and you desperately need to improve productivity. Which tactic do you think would work best: forcing employees to put in more hours so that the metric improves or asking them what you can do to make them happier at work? But how do you develop a mindset that puts others first? These blinks will show you the way. In these blinks, you’ll discover how one police officer reduced crime by offering coffee and public restrooms; and why you shouldn’t force your children to play sports. Do you ever wonder what determines the actions you take? Many people think that the things they do are just products of their personality, but the truth is more straightforward. It’s your mindset that controls your behavior. Basically, your mindset is the way you think of and see the world. It goes beyond your core beliefs about yourself to encompass the way you think about everything, including how you consider and treat others in society. Because it’s so far-reaching, your mindset is hugely important. As a result, making even small changes to it can result in dramatic differences in behavior and actions. Just take the Kansas City Police Department’s SWAT team. They had long been criticized by locals for their penchant for excessive violence. For example, many citizens had complained that the team would shoot pets during raids. Confronted by their own poor reputation, the SWAT team had no choice but to change its mindset and begin focusing on the feelings of suspects as well as their relatives. Suddenly the team began treating people with respect. Instead of acting aggressively, they strove for cooperation. In one example, before rushing off to question the suspects, the team took the time to calm a baby in the house. This new approach really paid off and actually improved the results of their crime fighting. So, a change of mindset can transform behavior but – best of all – it doesn’t even require much effort. Just imagine a company that’s in dire financial straits. To keep themselves above water they’re micromanaging costs and firing people left and right while slashing employee benefits and customer service. This mindset is based entirely on saving money, but is it really the right one for them? Instead, they could focus on making money, which would mean making decisions that bring in revenue. They’d begin looking at developing markets and technological innovations that could potentially solve their financial problems while keeping both their employees and customers happy. But why does so simple a change of mindset have such beneficial effects? You’ll find out in the next blink. When something in life goes wrong, people tend to search for excuses. Say someone has an interview for their dream job but doesn’t get an offer. The candidate immediately assumes that the failure is a result of, for instance, his parents not teaching him properly, or because his interviewer didn’t ask the correct questions. Such excuses are far from helpful; they’re the result of a negative inward mindset that focuses solely on the individual in question and what he wants for himself. So, how does such a mindset emerge? For starters, many people are too focused on attempting to control the situation they are in. A good example is when people try to make others behave a certain way, as a mother does when she scolds a noisy child. When such tactics fail, they grow upset and pessimistic. At other times, people lean too heavily on outdated hierarchical structures. Say you’re a manager at your company. You might develop a mindset of trying to protect your position and end up constantly seeking out faults in others, blaming them for any mistakes. Naturally, such an approach can produce serious issues, which is why it’s better to develop an outward mindset or one that’s focused on the needs and feelings of others. To do so, you need only concentrate on what you need from others to achieve your goals and what they need from you. To see the difference between these two mindsets in action, imagine being a parent of two children, and every day after work, you go outside with them to shoot hoops. If you’re a parent with an inward mindset, you might think, “I always make sure my kids get a workout every night.” But, if you’re a parent with an outward mindset, you might ask yourself: “Do my kids want to play basketball? I’ll ask them and see what they want. If not, we can find something else to do.” In other words, an outward mindset enables you to work out scenarios that fulfill the needs of both yourself and others. Next up, you’ll learn how to adopt such a mindset. Now that you know how an outward mindset can help you make positive changes in your life, it’s time to learn how to adopt one. To do so, just follow three easy steps based on the acronym SAM. The S stands for “seeing the needs of others.” That means focusing on other people rather than yourself. This is simple as long as you consider what other people need and want from any given situation. The A is for “adjusting your efforts.” Once you’ve identified what people need, you should take action to help them achieve it. And the last letter, M, stands for “measuring the impact.” This is key to determining how effective you’ve been. Did your actions help others in the way they actually needed to be helped? If not, change things up to make it work. Take the example of an NGO that was desperate to bring clean water to a remote area but had no idea how to do it. By starting with S, they saw that people in the area wanted their kids to be healthy and to attend school. From there, they moved to A, shifting their focus from supplying clean water to a broader approach of making sure children were healthy enough for school. Finally, they moved to M and began tracking the health of children in the area. By following these three steps, you too can change your mindset. But remember to focus on yourself and avoid forcing others to change themselves. After all, when you force other people into changing, you’re actually displaying an inward mindset that’s based on what you want. Instead, you need to make the change for yourself and show others how it works. Just imagine you’re an executive and you want your employees to shift their mindsets. You can’t just demand they do what you want – or expect them to change on their own. Rather, you have to alter your own mindset and show them that you care about their needs and desires. In the end, they’ll likely catch onto your positivity and follow the example you set. So, you can effect change in others by leading by example, but how exactly? Well, a great way to apply the power of your outward mindset is to use it to find a collective goal. After all, your outward mindset offers you the opportunity to identify mutually beneficial objectives, and working toward such goals helps produce shared solutions. Just take Kansas City, where 50 police officers were struggling to stop crime among the day laborers who would gather at a city park. The laborers saw each other as competitors for jobs, and this tension bred violence, theft and vandalism. One officer, Matt Tomasic, used his outward mindset to ask the day laborers what they needed. All they wanted were bathrooms and hot coffee, which were easy enough to provide. By making these simple changes, the department managed to reduce tensions and dramatically cut the crime rate, and it was all thanks to Tomasic identifying a collective goal. Both the police and day laborers got what they needed, and all it took was one person with an outward mindset. It just goes to show that your own position is irrelevant. It doesn’t matter if you’re a boss, an employee, a parent, teacher or child, anyone can make positive social change by adopting an outward mindset. Imagine you’re a customer service representative. You could improve the lives of customers all by yourself without waiting for your boss. All it would take is thinking about what customers need and how you can help them get it. They might need you to respond more rapidly or be more polite when addressing their concerns. Whatever it is, you can take an easy step to identifying a collective goal and satisfying your customers. Once your boss and co-workers see the results of your strategy, they’ll start making the same changes. So, start thinking about the needs of others. It could make all the difference in improving their lives and your own. The key message in this book: The right mindset is key to the success of your actions. To effectively work with others you need to understand what they need and how you can collectively achieve your goals. That means seeing others, adjusting your behavior to match their needs and measuring your impact.  Actionable Advice Treat your employees and colleagues right, especially those that interact with customers.  The lowest paid and worst-treated employees, whether they work at a movie theater or a call center, tend to be those who interact with customers the most. This is a recipe for disaster. If the employees who spend the most time talking to your customers are dissatisfied, they can’t possibly satisfy the customers themselves. So get rid of distinctions within your organization; take an inclusive view and an outward mindset that considers the needs of all employees. Got feedback?

But what you may have overlooked is your unconscious biases. No matter how open-minded and progressive you consider yourself to be, like everyone else, you most likely have biases informed by your upbringing and life experience. Author Dolly Chugh draws from the most cutting-edge psychological studies to present a fascinating picture of what’s informing our instinctual behaviors and decisions. These unconscious biases show – to just give one example – how even the most anti-racist of us can have racist tendencies resting just beneath the surface. Fortunately, by learning more about ourselves, others and how our minds work, we can start to correct these biases and become more aware of what we’re paying attention to and what we’ve been neglecting. In these blinks, you’ll learn why Hollywood still lacks equality; why white people need other white people to tell them they’re racist; and why you should never say you’re color-blind when it comes to race. When you’re deciding whether or not to do something, do you prefer to stick with the familiar or are you open to exploring new things? For documentary filmmaker Perrin Chiles, new things offer an exciting challenge. In the early 2000s, when Chiles was preparing for his next film, he chose the subject of autism, even though he had little first-hand knowledge of the subject. This attitude is a perfect example of what’s known as growth mindset, as it shows a willingness to learn new things. Having a growth mindset can lead to amazing things, and yet, many people have the opposite attitude, known as a fixed mindset. For example, someone has a fixed mindset if they believe they’re terrible at drawing and would never take an art class. They believe people are either good or bad at something, and no class will ever change that. Someone with growth mindset, however, may admit that their drawing skills are weak now, but acknowledge that with practice and effort their stick figure can one day become a realistic portrait. In other words, those with a growth mentality know that they can improve, and take advantage of opportunities to do so. For Chiles, his film on autism was an opportunity to learn about people who are different from him. And as ideas coming from a growth mindset often do, it led to great things. In this case, a wonderful documentary called Autism: The Musical. Released in 2007, the film touched millions of people and made significant strides in opening people’s eyes to the realities of autism. Unfortunately, not everyone is as open-minded as Chiles. Often, fixed mindsets can lead to stubborn prejudices that prevent people from exploring new things. This narrow-mindedness is especially true of Hollywood. If an extraterrestrial being were to make assumptions about human beings based strictly on Hollywood movies, they would likely think that nearly everyone is a straight, white male with no physical disabilities. In an overview of the highest-grossing films in recent years, only 27 percent of the speaking roles were female. As for the top films of 2015, 48 of them didn’t contain a single black actor in a speaking role. What’s more, only 4 percent of Hollywood’s new movies are directed by women. The following blinks explore why built-in prejudices like those found in Hollywood are so difficult to overcome. The term unconscious bias has become something of a buzzword lately. Essentially, it refers to the fact that people can unintentionally discriminate against others, or have prejudicial beliefs they’re not necessarily aware of. However, since researchers found a way to measure unconscious bias it’s now possible to increase this awareness. Remarkably, studies have shown that the average person processes around 11 million pieces of information every second. Yet, we only process around 40 of those on a conscious level! Therefore, you could say that 99.999 percent of the information we take in gets processed unconsciously. And this would include our unconscious biases. These are the automatic associations we make based on accumulated information, such as associating black people with weapons for instance. So, how do you measure unconcious bias? One way to do it is through an Implicit Association Test (IAT), an online test developed by Harvard psychologists Mahzarin Banaji, Anthony Greenwald and Brian Nosek. It measures the extent of your unconscious biases by asking you to react as quickly as possible to a series of questions that speak to your unconscious associations. For example, do you associate men or women with subjects like career and family or sciences and the arts? By requiring rapid decision-making, the test accesses your unconscious brain and assess your biases. As you may suspect, many supposedly open-minded participants were shocked by their IAT results.  Since the test went online in 2011, many people who identify as progressives and support gender equality have taken it. Yet, about 75 percent of all participants have shown a conservative-minded bias by strongly associating women with nurturing and household activities, and men with career and working. A similar bias was revealed regarding race, as 85 percent of white Americans associated black people with dangerous objects, such as knives and guns. Ultimately, people who were under the impression they had no racial or gender bias had to face the surprising results of the test. This just proves how unconscious these biases truly are. How difficult do you think your childhood was? When considering your personal history, don’t forget that white Americans, for example, generally have a much more privileged upbringing in terms of education, healthcare and standard of living than black Americans. Now, you might think that a reminder to keep things in perspective would result in more white Americans saying that their childhood wasn’t so bad. However, when this question was posed in just this fashion by Stanford psychologists in 2015, the opposite was true. White Americans actually emphasized the difficulty in their childhood more after being reminded of white privilege. In other words, people can accept that one group is disadvantaged while disregarding the advantages they had. Most people end up maintaining the falsehood that they too had to overcome adversity. This is because people believe that acknowledging their privilege makes their achievements appear unearned or undeserved. A similar trend exists in the workplace. Another study revealed how employees with high salaries and benefits like quality healthcare and legal services are more likely to emphasize the strenuous effort and difficulty their job requires after they’d been reminded about their perks. Interestingly enough, it’s also been shown that people stop discounting their privileges when they’re given a positive achievement to focus on. The 2015 Stanford study also revealed that the participants had different responses if, prior to being reminded of their privilege, they were asked to reflect on an impressive past accomplishment or given positive feedback on a test they’d taken. Now, when asked about their childhoods, the participants were more likely to recognize their privilege, since they no longer felt that their sense of self-worth was under threat. So, if you ever feel like someone needs a reminder about their privilege, you should remember to hand out a compliment before confronting them. Otherwise, they’ll likely deny that privilege played a role in helping them get where they are today. At this point, you may be wondering what an unconscious bias looks like. Well, let’s look at the example of Kimberly Davis, an African American executive and friend of the author. Once, when Davis was attending a convention for female executives, she entered a large room full of white women gathered in groups socializing. As Davis made her way around the room, none of the groups opened up to her. Davis didn’t feel like the groups were purposely or consciously rejecting her. She just assumed they didn’t recognize her as a fellow executive since a black businesswoman probably didn’t conform to their expectations. This is just one example of how subtle and prevalent unconscious biases can be. Or take Joe Lentine, who grew up just outside of Detroit. Lentine came from a white middle-class family. As he got older, he realized how odd it was that he only ever interacted with other white people, despite living so close to a multicultural and diverse city like Detroit. But statistics show that Lentine’s experience is quite common. According to Detroit Area studies taken during the 1980s and 1990s, white families tended to have little to no interaction with their black neighbors, even in predominantly black neighborhoods. The curious nature of this racial bias only struck Lentine after he bonded with a black member of his college fraternity. And this isn’t unusual, as overcoming an unconscious bias often requires making a proactive effort. As he moved on from college and took a job with General Motors, Lentine’s awareness of his racial bias continued to grow as well. To help get rid of it, he made a point of immersing himself in foreign cultures as much as possible by frequently traveling to places like India, Japan and South Korea. In 2009, when Lentine became the owner of Dental Plans Company, he addressed his biases even more proactively by partnering with an organization that helped transgender youth find jobs. He also reached out to his town’s US-Arab chamber of commerce to make sure his business truly reflected the diversity of his community. Just because we have unconscious biases, that doesn’t mean we have to accept them. With some effort, we can address them head-on and change how we interact with the world around us. If you’ve ever overheard a racist comment and assumed it’s not your place to speak up, you may want to think again. The African-American poet Christopher Owens got fed up with the endless number of messages he received on Facebook from people asking him to address someone else’s racist comments. This shows just how many people think that it’s up to people of color to confront racists. Yet, research shows that this isn’t the best solution. A 2003 study by psychologists Alexander Czopp and Margo Monteith showed that objections to racist statements were taken much more seriously when they came from other white people, rather than people of color. According to the researchers this is because there’s a common unconscious bias that associates privileged people with power and so, when they counter a racist remark or behavior, it has a greater impact. This is especially true in the workplace. In a 2016 study done by psychologists and management researchers, 350 North American executives were interviewed to assess how effective they were in promoting diversity within their teams. After speaking with the executives, the researchers surveyed the executives’ bosses to find out how they perceived the ongoing diversification efforts of their employees. The results showed that white male executives are routinely perceived in a positive light, whether or not they’re successful in creating a diverse team. Meanwhile, executives who are women or people of color are far more likely to be harshly criticized. Not only that, but a white man can hire anyone he wishes – be that women, minorities or a team entirely made up of other white men – with little worry of receiving negative scrutiny from his boss. At the same time, a black person is likely to be criticized if they hire other black people, and a woman will be viewed negatively if she hires other women. So, even if women and minority executives are promoting diversity in the company, they could still receive criticism for doing so! Since white males have the power to enact change without getting in trouble, they have a greater responsibility to help curb racism and promote workplace diversity. If you follow popular literature, you may have heard of the American author Jodi Picoult. Picoult sees herself as a progressive person, so she was taken aback when her son Kyle and his partner Kevin explained that she was sure to have unconscious racist biases based on her privileged white upbringing. Prior to this discussion, Picoult equated racism with the behavior of white supremacists. But Kyle and Kevin were eventually able to show Picoult how unconscious bias works. She became so eager to correct this lack of awareness that she enrolled in an anti-racism workshop. It was a lengthy process, but Picoult was able to start recognizing her own biases, and the experience led her to write her 2016 book Small Great Things. Picoult’s experience is quite typical, and it points to the three stages of changing your consciousness around racial identity. The first stage is denial. At this point, people must confront their misconceptions. But here’s the problem. Not only do many people refuse to believe they have any prejudices, but also think that racism in general no longer exists. This belief takes time to correct. The second stage is acceptance, and only some people will make it this far. By now, the person will have taken some active measures toward recognizing their biases. This is followed by the third stage: deeper understanding. Here, white people can finally begin to understand that their experience is different from that of people of color. At this stage, a person will also question their own racial identity and what influence it has had on their life. So, if you’re really interested in changing your awareness of racial identity, you should embark on these three stages. Be aware that many people try to skip straight to stage two because they don’t want to confront the ugly truth of their own denial. In fact, when we strongly believe in something, we have an inclination not to examine it too closely. For example, a 2005 study by management scientists Kristine Ehrich and Julie Irwin showed that consumers who are strongly opposed to child labor are likely to overlook how their clothes or electronics are made. Similarily, it can be difficult to stay aware of equality and not be overwhelmed by all the racism in society. But it’s important to look closely and not turn away so that you can make lasting changes to your consciousness. Recently, it’s become increasingly common for people to deflect any suspicion of racism by saying they’re color-blind, or that they don’t see people in terms of color. That may sound laudable, but is this a good thing? In a 2008 study, Harvard University researchers Evan Apfelbaum and Michael Norton showed that this isn’t a sensible attitude to have. Participants were divided into pairs. Some pairs had two white participants, while others had one black and one white participant. The participants were then asked to choose a piece of paper with a face on it. They then had to ask each other questions until they could guess which face the other person chose. In white-white pairs, 51 percent of the participants asked their partner the obvious question of whether the face was that of a black or a white person. But in black-white pairs, many of the white participants pretended to be color-blind, with only 21 percent asking this question. And as it turned out, the “color-blind” participants were perceived by their black partners as being more racist – not less so. Another unhelpful yet common trait is to categorize people as having certain qualities or behaviors based on race. Even if the intention is to be complementary, such stereotypes suggest that certain people have less individuality than others. For example, it’s sometimes said that Asian people tend to be hard-working and well-behaved, or that Asian Americans are wealthy and academically talented. These may seem like nice attributes to have, but they can be detrimental if an Asian American is applying for financial assistance or for a job that requires physical strength. If the people processing these applications believe these stereotypes, this might affect their decision to provide financial aid or hire the applicant. There’s a good chance you’ve had the experience of being distracted while someone is telling you something. This inability to really listen to others is a big problem, and the constant presence of distracting technology is only making it worse. If we hope to make our companies truly inclusive, we need to listen carefully to make sure every voice is heard. Now, statistics show that minority voices are at high risk of being ignored. In 2006, when the author was researching her PhD on unconscious bias, she went out on the streets of Boston with a container of jelly beans and asked random people to guess how many were in the jar. To help them find the right answer, the author played them recordings of a wide range of people all providing good advice. The author purposefully recorded actors with voices that were recognizably white, black or Latino. As you may expect, the participants most often took the white man’s advice, while ignoring the other voices. Keep this kind of unconscious bias in mind at your next meeting by making sure you listen to people who aren’t white men. You should also pay attention to who receives credit for work. In a University of Washington study from 1979, psychologists Michael Ross and Fiore Sicoly revealed that individuals who are part of a group project tend to give themselves more credit than an objective project supervisor would. But this also means that people tend to give others less credit than they deserve. Now, based on everything that we’ve learned about unconscious bias so far, we can assume that, since minority voices are more likely to be discounted than non-minorities, they’re also likely to receive less credit from their peers on a group project. So the next time you’re wrapping up a successful project at work, make sure that credit is given to everyone who deserves it and that coworkers with a minority background don’t get overlooked. The key message in these blinks: Unconscious biases are very real, even if the vast majority believe they have no prejudices. Research shows that many of us have negative biases against people of color. We’re also less willing to listen to advice that isn’t coming from a white man. It is possible, however, for all of us to increase our level of consciousness on matters of racial identity. To do so, we must be prepared to learn about what life is like for those who don’t have our personal experience and be persistent in questioning our unconscious biases. Actionable advice: Be more selective about the media you consume. The media we take in is crucial to our perception of people, since it provides a window into worlds we’re not familiar with. That’s why it’s beneficial to watch inclusive series and films, such as All in the Family, Black-ish or Modern Family. If we only engage with series that reflect a limited social reality, such as shows where every character is white and straight, our ability to understand other people decreases. Being picky about your media intake is an effective way to correct your unconscious biases. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You can bring together some of the brightest minds and still have a highly dysfunctional team. As you’ll find out in the blinks ahead, what makes a truly effective team is a mixture of different qualities, chief among them the commitment to making or achieving something that can’t be done alone. We know that great things can happen when people come together and put their minds to it. In a way, modern civilization is a testament to what human cooperation is capable of. Author Jon Gordon performs a valuable service by telling us what every team leader should know, from what qualities a perfect team should have to which pitfalls can bring down even the best teams. In these blinks, you’ll learn why culture is Apple’s secret ingredient; how a vampire motivated a football team; and why it pays to study details few people will ever see. The business world is filled with challenges, starting with trying to get new ideas, organizations and products off the ground. Of course, having a great team at your service can be a huge asset, and yet keeping that team running smoothly presents its own challenges. For starters, it’s important to keep your team motivated when times are tough or when your goal looks more like a fantasy than a real possibility. This is just one example of when staying positive is crucial to staying afloat. One of the big benefits of establishing an optimistic, positive outlook within your team is that everyone benefits, with the group as a whole, as well as each individual, experiencing an increased likelihood of success. According to a report from Duke University, optimistic individuals have a greater likelihood of succeeding in politics, business and sports. The benefits of positive thinking extend beyond the workplace as well: the pioneering psychologist John Gottman found that married couples who engaged in five positive interactions for every one negative interaction were much likelier to stay together than the couples who were closer to a one-to-one ratio. And what about team leaders? Well, they also benefit from the positive workplace environment they help create – and it starts with having devoted team members. According to the research of organizational expert Wayne Baker, leaders who exude positive energy naturally attract other people. So, if you’re a leader with a vision and you project an aura of optimism and unity, people in your workplace will naturally want to be around you. As Baker explains, positive-thinking leaders will inevitably attract talented colleagues, rather than other leaders, and these people will likely devote their time willingly to your projects. It’s also likely that they’ll share new information, opportunities and ideas with you before they share them with anyone else. To put it simply: when the team is thinking positively, everyone wins. If you want a healthy and high-functioning team, you need to have a healthy and positive team culture. This may sound like a no-brainer, but “culture” is one of those slippery concepts that can be easier to recognize than it is to define. The fact is, culture is the sum of many parts as it includes both the written and unwritten rules that dictate how a team works, communicates and acts. Therefore, you can think of culture as the team’s beating heart – the force behind everything your team stands for and does. It makes sense, then, that all of the world’s most successful organizations pay careful attention to cultivating a healthy culture. Apple, one of the most successful companies in the world, has a strong culture that can be recognized in everything they do. From day one, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were consciously creating a culture that would not only set them apart but would also inform everything Apple did and how they did it – whether it was hiring, product design or ad campaigns. Decades later, the culture that the two Steves created has proved so strong that this influential heart is still beating fiercely within the company. Nowadays, Apple’s motto is legendary: “Culture beats strategy.” While this is a catchy phrase, it doesn’t mean you can neglect strategy. On the contrary, a smart strategy is important. But it’s your culture that will ultimately determine whether your strategy is successful or not. Now, your team will be looking to its leader to create a positive team culture, but when it comes to making that culture a reality, everyone in a team has a significant role to play. In a study by the Heart Math Institute, researchers found that people can sense another person’s feelings from as far away as ten feet. So, even when you’re not directly in front of someone, it doesn’t let you off the hook in terms of how you’re projecting your energy. There’s another study by Harvard University that suggests that everyone’s emotions are “contagious” since they affect those around them. This means that your cheerful mood – or your grumpy vibe – can spread throughout the team. Everyone and anyone in the team can create a positive or negative ripple-effect depending on their mood. In their attempts to establish a positive team culture, many organizations make a simple but critical mistake: they reward positivity and yet ignore the hints of negativity lurking just below the surface. This may sound relatively harmless, but unaddressed negativity is guaranteed to fester and grow until it eventually infects the whole team. Fortunately, there are reliable cures that can disinfect any team of its lurking negativity. For starters, every team will benefit from making a vow not to be brought down by negativity. For this decision to become a reality, bold action may need to be taken. In 2011, the author was told about one such action when he visited with the University of Georgia’s football team. That year, the team was on a multi-season slump, and the coach was adamant about keeping any subsequent negative feelings away from the team. So, after the next season got off to a rocky start, the coach took the dramatic step of having a vampire painted onto the wall of the team meeting room. This wasn’t just any old vampire, either – it was a “negative energy vampire,” and if any player or coach did anything negative, their photo was placed on the vampire wall. This sent a strong message about just how adamant the coach was about the team staying positive – no matter what. It was also a huge success, as once the vampire emerged, the team broke their losing streak and won their next ten games! Another tactic with proven results is to implement a “no complaining” rule. As the name suggests, this rule forbids any team members from complaining, unless they’re presenting a solution to their complaint. This is terrifically effective at eliminating much of the mindless yet toxic complaining while also promoting and generating solutions. The rule was invented by Dwight Cooper, the CEO of the talent management company PPR, which has been voted one of America’s best workplaces. These days, we have a vast number of ways to communicate: through email, texting and a variety of messaging apps and social media platforms. But the irony is, one of the most common reasons for a dysfunctional team is poor communication. It begs the question: Why are so many teams feeling disconnected when there are so many tools for reaching out to one another? The answer is, with so many different ways of communicating, our messages have become less meaningful. This can lead to disastrous results. Communication voids are formed within teams when members and leaders consistently choose to neglect face-to-face communication in favor of smartphones, email and social media. It’s especially damaging when leaders never communicate with team members one-on-one. When this happens, negativity can easily fill the communication void as rumors, gossip and complaints replace trust and cooperation. When faced with the void, it’s only a matter of time before team members begin to assume the worst and adopt a mind-set of fear and survival. There’s only one thing that can restore the balance and keep negativity at bay: clear communication. Therefore, a powerful and positive team must combat negativity by prioritizing regular, meaningful communication. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to promote healthy communication methods within your team. For example, the author has seen success with sales teams that schedule daily conference calls where learning opportunities, achievements and obstacles are discussed. You may think that working remotely means you have to forego normal, beneficial communication, but that’s not the case. Even if you’re not in the office, you can establish daily or weekly video conferences. Mealtimes are also great opportunities to connect team members. Leaders especially can benefit from regularly eating lunch with a different colleague each week, to strengthen bonds. It takes more than one superstar to create a winning team. Extraordinary teams require the collaboration of extraordinary members who are committed to achieving greatness. You may think Oscar-winning actors do it all by themselves, but in reality, each one has a whole crew of dedicated individuals who made their performance possible, from the writer, director and cinematographer to the set designer. Just because we don’t see them on the movie screen doesn’t mean they’re not an invaluable part of the process. For greatness to happen, it takes the care and commitment of every individual working together. Committing to a team means that me turns into we, and one of the special things that happens when a team like this comes together is that it can now achieve things that people on their own cannot. Business coach and former Navy SEAL, Nick Hays, will never forget “Hell Week,” the most brutal and dreaded part of the SEAL selection process. Part of the week involves a 200-mile run while soaking wet and on the verge of hypothermia, with each night providing less than four hours’ sleep. The recruits who were first to quit before the week was up were the ones who focused primarily on themselves. They couldn’t see beyond their own pain and discomfort. By not committing to the team, they didn’t draw strength from the other members and therefore didn’t have what was needed to complete the grueling week. The recruits who did become SEALS were more committed to their team than to themselves. They bonded, motivated each other and wouldn’t dare quit for fear of letting the team down. It takes a desire and a genuine consideration and caring to connect with and commit to your team. Once you do, great things can happen. One day, when Steve Jobs was a kid, his dad was building a fence, and young Steve asked him why he was putting so much care into painting the back of the fence, which no one would ever see. His father replied, “But you will know.” Steve Jobs’s father taught him to genuinely care about every project he took on, and he internalized that wisdom and put it to work in the products he made later. With Apple, he took so much care that those early products still inspire awe and passion among the company’s team and their millions of loyal customers. If you’ve ever been fortunate enough be part of a powerful, positive team, you’ll know that it’s not just fun and games. With a commitment to achieving greatness, there also comes a striving – a desire to improve yourself for the betterment of the team. This means that an exceptional team isn’t just a collection of individuals committed to one another, they’re also committed to self-improvement as part of the overall pursuit of excellence. Every member of a great and positive team is endlessly restless and always looking for new ways to improve, grow and learn. Knowing this can help you spot a truly exceptional team. Just look for the ones with people who are both hungry and humble. Seek out the team of people who are not afraid to be uncomfortable if it means they’ll grow and learn. The individuals in the best teams are the kind who are unwilling to settle for mediocrity. Instead, they challenge the status quo while keeping their eyes firmly locked on the prize of greatness. Another powerful tip that you can introduce for self-improvement and achieving greatness is the one percent rule. When this rule is in place, each team member agrees to show up to work and give one percent more energy, effort, focus and time than they gave yesterday. Of course, a one-percent daily improvement is practically impossible to quantify, but nevertheless, the rule gets results. The author saw it put to effective use in a women’s college lacrosse team. Each of the team’s 35 players agreed to the rule, and in the spirit of positive thinking and teamwork, they believed that the combined improvement should amount to a 35 percent increase across the whole team each day. Naturally, this is a significant amount of growth, and by being committed to seeing it happen the team did indeed experience an incredible improvement. This team of 35 lacrosse players is a perfect example of the power that can be created when positivity, commitment and selflessness come together in the pursuit of greatness. The key message in these blinks: Great teamwork is built on fostering positivity and optimism by promoting a culture that values commitment, care and clear communication between all team members. It leaves no room for negativity to seep in. A positive team is built up of individuals who are devoted to one another and to constant self-improvement, with the knowledge that their efforts can make amazing things happen.  Actionable advice: Care comes before criticism.  A functioning team requires its members to give one another constructive criticism from time to time since this is part of the process for improvement. You should be aware that people are more receptive to criticism when they believe the person providing it has their best interests at heart. No one appreciates criticism from someone who doesn’t seem to care about them. So it’s wise to learn and care about each team member while being sure to express that caring attitude on a daily basis.

You may be bullied by a classmate. Or find that you’re always cleaning up the emotional messes of a friend. Or perhaps you fear the day you’ll let down a loved parent who thinks the world of you. All of these relationships have one thing in common: they are unhealthy and keep you from being the happy, fulfilled person you can and should be. Fortunately, there are many healthy, beneficial relationships in the world. Sometimes, with the correct tools, we can improve the troubled ties with which we bind ourselves. These blinks will help you identify the different types of relationships you’re in and show how each affects how you live your life. In these blinks, you’ll discover why President Reagan told his security advisor about squirrels in the Rose Garden; how a relationship might feel great but really be toxic; and how a “corner four relationship” is the positive bond you need. No bodybuilder strengthens just one or two muscles, but trains to improve his entire body. Cultivating happiness works the same way. If you want to live a happier life, you have to work on yourself as a whole. This means taking care of your mental health, which means taking care of your brain. The brain functions through a combination of electrical charges, hormones and neurotransmitters. If something upsets the balance of these elements, you won’t feel well. For example, if your brain doesn't secrete a sufficient amount of the chemical serotonin, you'll struggle to focus and potentially feel depressed. Your success and well-being also depend on your relationships. Each and every person needs close, supportive relationships to thrive. Strong relationships help us cope with stress, overcome setbacks in our lives and even heal pain. Unhealthy relationships, on the other hand, add stress. They can hamper your ability to deal with tough situations at work, for example. Imagine returning home from a rough day at the office. If you turn to a partner to vent but your partner just makes fun of you, you'll feel even worse. In addition to taking care of your brain and your relationships, you also have to tend to your mind. Your mind isn't the same thing as your brain, however. Your brain is like a piece of hardware, where your mind is the software that runs it. Your mind is essentially the mental process that works to decode incoming information, and importantly, determines how you react to this information. Understanding what's happening in your mind is a key element of living well. When you understand your mind, you can stay in control of your thoughts and better manage your emotions. All three components – your brain, mind and relationships – are crucial in leading a happy life. Now we’re going to go deeper and focus on just one of these elements: your relationships. Every relationship falls into one of four categories or connection corners. Let's start with the three kinds of relationships you should avoid. The first kind is a corner one relationship, in which you can’t claim a real connection with the other person. You don't exchange any meaningful information or positive energy with the person, so you don't get anything substantial out of the relationship. Imagine a manager who feels lonely even though she's surrounded by coworkers, day in and day out. Her teammates don't share important news, and she doesn't involve her team in decision making. This complete lack of connection is why this example is a corner one relationship. Romantic partners might maintain a corner one relationship if they don't empathize with or support each other. If you feel that your partner doesn't listen to you, for example, or is lacking in empathy, you probably have a poor connection with that partner – a classic corner one relationship. The second kind is a corner two relationship, in which a relationship is harmful. It’s difficult to live alone, so people who struggle to connect with others often end up “settling” for a romantic partner, even if at the core the person is a poor match. Bad connections, however, aren't always abusive. Perhaps you don't feel well whenever you spend time with a particular person, or maybe a person makes you feel inferior or self-conscious. These are harmful relationships. The third kind is a corner three relationship, and often doesn’t appear damaging on the surface. Yet corner three relationships are bad because they're fake. While an unconnected or harmful relationship might make you feel bad about yourself, a fake relationship can make you feel good, at least temporarily. Yet corner three relationships are often based on harmful connections, such as a shared addiction, an illicit affair or an ego-based partnership based on false praise. The problem is, you can easily get hooked on a fake relationship. Passion, admiration or intoxication might feel good in the moment, but they always leave you wanting more. What’s a corner four relationship? The next blink explains. Do you have close friends or relatives with whom you can fully be yourself? People with whom you don't have to fear letting your guard down? When you're with people like this, you show your true self – not the false self you often present to the world. Your false self is like a mask you wear for protection. It makes you feel stronger, smarter or more confident than you are. We use our false selves to earn respect and guard against people who might ridicule or attack us. Leaders, in particular, tend to hide their true selves because they're always in the spotlight. People admire leaders and place their faith in them, so leaders often feel they can never show weakness. Former President Bill Clinton, for instance, once told former British Prime Minister Tony Blair about the importance of putting on a “face,” or pretending to be strong and optimistic no matter what. In a corner four relationship – a real connection – you don't have to pretend. You feel safe sharing everything you think and feel within your relationship. You and your partner understand and care deeply for each other. Your partner won't take advantage of you if you show weakness. Part of the reason leaders are successful is that they are often people who have overcome challenges and sought advice from mentors. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson nearly gave up his dream to found an airline because he was inexperienced and didn't have enough capital to compete with giants like British Airways. Instead of quitting, however, he reached out to airline veteran Freddie Laker and admitted that he needed help. With Laker's help, Branson became a major player in the airline industry. Sometimes confiding in a trustworthy person about a weakness is the most powerful thing you can do. Have you ever walked into a party, class or meeting and immediately felt good? Sometimes a space exudes positive energy, even if you can't put your finger on the reason why. This feel-good energy is generated from corner four relationships. Real connections give you many kinds of energy. You might feel joy and excitement, and be extra-motivated, when you’re part of a positive team or on a good date – exactly the energy you feel when you first enter that room – but there's something else, too: intellectual stimulation. Intellectual stimulation comes in many forms. Maybe you and your friends like to speculate about the origins of the universe, learn new skills together or explore new places. The author discovered the importance of intellectual stimulation when he became depressed after a golf injury. He recovered thanks to two loving people: a fraternity brother and the fraternity brother’s sister. They fueled his intellect by giving him books, improving his diet, increasing his physical energy and offering emotional, loving care. It is these real, energized connections that we need to succeed. Think back to that room filled with positive energy. In any successful organization, there are many such rooms. Great leaders take care of employees by encouraging and challenging them to be their best. Positive communities are also helpful when you’re facing a personal challenge, such as overcoming an addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous and Weight Watchers are successful because these organizations provide people with a space to meet, connect and cheer each other along the road to success. A person who respects you won't necessarily solve your problems for you. In fact, the opposite is usually true. Let's look at the reasons why. A corner four relationship offers you freedom, but it comes with responsibility, too. When people are healthy and well-connected, they respect each other's autonomy and intelligence. They don't fight for control; both partners are free to make both positive choices and mistakes. And when a person respects your autonomy, that person doesn’t barge in to solve problems for you. They trust you to handle the problems yourself, which means you need to step up and do so! Former US National Security Advisor Colin Powell once was briefing then President Ronald Reagan on global hotspots, looking for advice from the president. While Powell talked on, Reagan suddenly said, “Hey look, they're eating them!” The fact was that Reagan wasn't paying attention to Powell at all. He was instead watching squirrels eating nuts in the Rose Garden. His interruption sent a clear message to Powell, however. It was as if he said, “It's your problem, and I trust you to solve it on your own.” Powell had freedom in his relationship with Reagan, which meant he also had a lot of responsibility. A person with whom you share a real connection might not solve your problems, but they'll give you valuable feedback. These people want to see you do well, so they'll give you extra attention. If you're a writer, a friend might read your new manuscript closely. That friend then will offer specific feedback – detailed enough for you to act on so that you can improve your work. The feedback that helps you solve problems yourself is always more valuable in the long run. Pixar is one of the best animation studios in the world. Their greatest films, like Up and WALL-E, became instant classics when they were released. So it might surprise you to learn that when Pixar starts a new project, the first work they produce is usually terrible! It's natural to fail and start out less than perfectly. Even the greatest projects often have a bumpy start, and setbacks are simply part of the process. When you begin a project, there's usually some distance between where you are and where you want to be. It’s totally normal to make mistakes when learning a new skill, like playing piano or investing in the stock market. That's where healthy relationships play a particularly important role. They help you overcome challenges and failures. You can only admit to a problem or failure if you feel safe, that is, if you have a real connection. The more you admit to failure, the more you get used to it and accept failure as a regular part of the learning process. The author, for instance, once felt like a failure when he made a bad decision, but he confided in his mentor who told him, “We've all been there.” When he realized that even his mentor had been through struggles like his, he started to realize it was okay to fail. Likewise, the employees at Pixar also feel safe to discuss their mistakes. They've learned to view setbacks as problems the team can address and overcome together. Environments like that at Pixar foster corner four relationships that allow us to accept failure instead of perceiving it as a threat. When you're in a close relationship, you can gain insight that might reshape the way you think and behave through a process called internalization. In short, you internalize the things that your friend or partner tells or teaches you. Think of a child whose mother tells her not to touch a hot stove. After the child has heard this warning enough times, she'll internalize it. Next time she sees a hot stove, she can warn herself, and won’t need her mother to remind her. This is why real connections are so powerful. When you share a strong connection with a person, that individual can profoundly impact the rest of your life, even after that person moves away or passes on. The insights such relationships transmit live on as memories and thought patterns that can shape your behavior. What’s more, you can use internalization to affect other people's behavior! Imagine you're a leader planning to retire in a year, and you're afraid your company might fall apart without you. How can you ensure your employees keep everything running smoothly? You can help your teammates by sharing your values and knowledge with them, so these lessons are internalized over time. Eventually, your team will understand how the company works just as well as you do and adopt your good habits as their own. You might help employees develop new routines now to continue after you've retired. If you're particular about responding to customer complaints with a personalized message, for example, get your successor to start writing similar letters before you leave. Child rearing works through the same process of internalization. Sure, your teenaged son won't let you accompany him on a date, but you can teach him how to take precautions with strangers and new partners before that first date even happens. Why do people invest money in stocks? They expect their investment to pay off over time. In a similar fashion, we invest time, effort and goodwill into relationships because we expect them to improve our lives. So how do you know whether you should trust someone? Let's go over some criteria for assessing trust. First, trust someone only if you're sure that person understands what's important to you. Imagine you’ve hired a hardworking gardener but he misunderstands your instructions and accidentally poisons your whole garden. If someone doesn't understand what you need, that person can be destructive – even if he had good intentions from the start! Second, make sure the person has your best interests at heart. Does the person want the best for you? Third, ask yourself if the person is reliable before you turn to him for help. You wouldn't trust an alcoholic to help you get sober, for instance. If the person hasn’t been able to overcome his addiction, he’s unlikely to offer positive guidance on helping you overcome your problems. Fourth, assess the person's character. Character isn't just about honesty or integrity, but also about specific character traits. Certain traits can be helpful or harmful depending on the situation. You shouldn't trust a pessimist to help you realize a daring idea, for example. And fifth, consider the past experiences you've shared with the person. Past experiences tell you in which kind of situations you can trust the person. Let’s say you depended on a friend to pick you up at the airport, but he forgot. If he made the same mistake again at a later date, you probably shouldn't trust him a third time. Trust is important yet complex, and is one of the key elements of any strong connection – don't take it lightly. The key message in this book: Your health and happiness depend largely on the relationships in your life. So do your best to avoid non-connections, bad connections and fake connections. Strive to make real connections that nurture you, help you overcome challenges and improve as a person. Choose wisely when placing your trust in people. Relationships can change your thoughts and behavior, so forge them only with people who are right for you. Actionable advice: Be specific about what you want from a partner. The next time you're feeling dissatisfied in a relationship, be specific when telling your partner what you want. Don't say you want to “connect more.” Say that you'd like to spend more time together by going on afternoon walks or dinner dates. You can't plan to “connect,” but you can plan a date!

You’ve seen him already, or you are one yourself: the founder who can’t let go. Like an overprotective father, you saw something come to life and now you want to witness every minor step your creation takes. You think you’re being helpful, but the hard-to-swallow truth is: you’re standing in the way. So, how can you avoid this fate? If you’re a founder, the answer’s quite easy: make yourself replaceable! Don’t worry, it doesn’t mean you have to quit. It means that you set up a smoothly running company that can operate without your help, allowing you to focus on what you should be doing: driving your company’s vision and shaping its future. In these blinks, you’ll find out how a good app can act like an external brain; which three rules to apply to every incoming email; and why skills and education aren’t always the most important factors in a new hire. A lot of founders see themselves as a sort of puppet master. They want to be in total control, having their strings attached to every minor motion on stage. What most of them don’t realize is that they often do more harm than good to their company. If you are a founder, you should rather think of yourself as an initiator. You can think of your business as a set of dominos, and you are the first piece to set everything in motion. The important part here is that everything should be set up just fine, with all the pieces in place. Once the first domino falls, everything will take care of itself. The key message here is: Make yourself replaceable by building the right company structures.  As a founder, it’s easy to get caught up in all of the details of your business. But it is not your job to figure out a Customer Relations Management system or come up with a Social Media strategy. Your job is to find the right people to do this for you. You need to set up an organizational structure and then enable your employees to do their best possible jobs without further input. Again: The best job you can do is make yourself replaceable. At least in the daily operational business. Take the example of one CEO, Malte Holm, who found himself overwhelmed by small fires he had to put out. Employees were running to him every day with every little problem, and as a consequence, he found himself severely overworked. He had to think big picture and reset some of his company’s domino pieces. One of the problems was in HR. As Holm looked into it and talked to the HR manager, he discovered the cause: the manager was spending four hours stuck in traffic every day! So Holm did what he had to do to make her job easier. He helped her set up an effective home office, complete with high-speed internet connection. Finally, she could spend more time doing her job. Not only did Holm make her life easier, but it also led him to feel better. There was one fewer fire to put out, and he could get back to the work that matters. You start a new project at work. At first everything is going well and everyone is excited. But then something happens and, for whatever reason, the project stalls. Suddenly, everyone is scratching their heads, wondering what happened and what to do next. When this happens, it's usually a sign that it's not clear enough what needs to be done and who should be doing what. The key message here is: Identify tasks and clarify responsibilities. Luckily, there are some helpful project management practices that founders and company leaders can use to make sure projects run smoothly and with a lot less head-scratching along the way. The first is to make sure that every project is broken down into clear tasks. Whatever the goal of the project is, it should be divided up into as many small steps as possible. This way, it will be much clearer to everyone involved how to get from point A to point Z. Also, it's a good way to keep people motivated because, for every step they complete, they’ll feel like they're making progress and getting closer to the goal. By the way, this principle is equally true for personal projects. Let’s say you have three hours to turn in an 850-word article. Sounds daunting, right? But if you break it down into a series of 15-minute steps, you'll find it a lot less scary. If the first step is to do some research, and the second step is to create a rough outline, all that’s left is writing around 85 words every 15 minutes. That’s doable.   Now, when managing a group project, once you’ve broken things down into small enough tasks, it’s time to assign the tasks and make sure everyone knows who’s responsible for what. This is where the second management tool comes in, RACI, short for Responsible Accountable Consulted Informed. The Responsible person, often the CEO or founder, gives the project the go-ahead and is ultimately in charge. If a big project is launched without this person’s blessing, it’s probably off to a bad start. The Accountable person tracks how the project is progressing and makes sure everyone’s getting their work done. This person also keeps the boss updated and in the loop if any big changes need to be made to the project. The Consulted person is the specialist who’s brought in whenever a task requires expert advice or skills that exceed those of the regular team. Finally, the Informed person is anyone who needs to be kept up to date on the project, such as the client. The Informed can be multiple parties, but it’s often fewer people than you might expect. When everyone knows their assignment and who they need to report to, problems can be identified quickly and dealt with, and everyone can focus on moving forward. If you’re a founder and you're constantly overwhelmed with work, it’s usually a sign that you've forgotten an important aspect of great leadership: delegation. The key to delegating effectively is to make an honest assessment of what kind of tasks you’re not particularly good at or passionate about. These are the things you need to delegate to others. If you’re lousy at accounting, for instance, you should probably hand this task over to someone else. This may sound simple enough in theory, but it practice it can be difficult. Luckily, there’s a simple way to make it easier. The key message here is: Delegate better by using a system called the six levels of delegation. The first level of delegation involves simple tasks, like having someone purchase a book online for you. For things like this, all you need to do is give someone a direct order. Done. The second level involves slightly more complex tasks, like booking a flight for a specific time between New York and Phoenix. In this case, you can ask someone to do some research, see what’s available and prepare a summary for you. The third level would be if the research also comes with advice, so that you can make a more informed decision. If, say, you’re looking to buy property in Seattle, you may ask someone to research the city’s real estate agents and present you with a list of which agents they believe are the top five. At level four, you would delegate even more responsibility. For example, you might ask someone on your team with real estate experience to choose an agent in Seattle, start the process of finding and purchasing the property but to keep you updated each step of the way so that you can make the final decision. At level five, you would hand over decision making authority, while setting certain limits. For example, they can find the property and make a purchase as long as it is in a certain part of the city and under a certain price – otherwise they need to consult with you. Finally, at level six, you give full authority to another person to handle a task as they see fit. They can decide upon the agent, the location and how much to spend on the property. Determining which tasks need to be delegated and to whom can be difficult. But knowing these different levels can help you get the right task to the right person. The hardest thing for you as a founder, however, will probably be to hand over the kind of authority that level five and six call for. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how to go about recruiting those people. One of the hallmarks of any great founder or CEO is the quality of the team they put together. That's because building a team of excellent employees is easier said than done. Luckily, there are steps you can take to increase your chances of hiring great talent. The first is to make sure you pay attention to the special skill sets they bring to the table. The key message here is: When recruiting, look for skills, personality and problem-solving abilities. It’s tempting to recruit an employee with some specific person in mind, be it a specific age, gender or educational background, but this can be limiting. Instead, you should focus on the skills you need this person to have. However, you don’t want to lose sight of how important the person's personality is. After all, this is someone you might end up spending a lot of time with, and just because they have every IT skill you’re looking for doesn’t mean they have the personality of a great employee. So it’s important that you also look for skills that go hand-in-hand with good personalities, and you can often do this during a trial period. This is a good time to see if, for example, they are proactive and willing to go the extra mile. Anyone can order a book online for you. But the right hire might be the person who orders the book, and then follows up to see if it arrived on time, and whether you need something else. Another high-quality skill is attention to detail. People who can spot small mistakes, like an important client’s name missing from a guest list, are invaluable to any business. Problem-solving skills can be another sign of a potentially great hire. For example, if you’re trying to find a great writer, rather than looking at their writing samples, look at how they respond to a quick assignment like brushing up a poorly written article. After all, anyone can submit decent work that took them 50 drafts to write, but what you really want are people who can solve problems on the spot. Skills like these will prove useful in any number of situations. So if you keep this in mind during the hiring process, you’ll increase your chances of surrounding yourself with excellent employees. Great. Now you’ve got a well-oiled company in place. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean that problems will stop happening. Even worse: All of them seem to require your immediate attention. So how do you handle those day-to-day urgencies? Truth is: As long as no one’s hacking your company account, most of your problems are not as urgent as you think they are. Even though you feel like it, you don’t have to act on every problem immediately. Acknowledging this reality will ultimately help you work in more productive ways. For example, by blocking off your most productive times for others. The key message here is: Reserve your peak time for flow activities. Generally speaking, everyone has a peak time – a window of around ninety minutes during the day when your work efficiency kicks into high gear. Naturally, this is the time when you’re most likely to engage in flow activity, a time of uninterrupted concentration where you’re effortlessly able to accomplish a lot in a little time. But how can you find out when you’re most productive? Well, there’s an app for this. The author’s company produces the Less Doing Peak Time app which monitors your interactions with the app and tells you when your nervous system is at its peak. Once you’ve figured that out, make sure you get the best out of your daily peak time. To do so, reserve this time for work that typically requires high concentration, like writing or composing. You should also let your colleagues know that this time is off-limits for any calls or disturbances. And remember, just because someone says it’s urgent, that doesn’t make it a genuine emergency. Once you’ve got a grasp of your own peak times, you can also help improve your colleagues’ productivity by being aware and respecting theirs, just as you ask them to not disturb your peak times. However, when setting up meetings that require creative thinking and generating ideas, you can try to schedule it so that you’re getting as many people as possible during their peak time. This way, you’ll increase your chances of people being sharp, lively and overflowing with brilliant ideas. At the very least, this knowledge will make sure you avoid scheduling meetings during the dreaded daily slump time, when people generate more yawns than good ideas. When speaking to audiences around the world, the author regularly asks them: What keeps you from being creative? The most common answer is: My cluttered inbox. So what can you do about it? The key message here is: Tame your emails with filters and the Do, Delete or Defer rule. One first and easy fix to this problem is to create filters. For example, you can create a filter that will catch any email containing the word “unsubscribe” and send it to a separate folder. Since it will remove all those newsletters and website updates you subscribe to, this filter alone will already declutter your inbox significantly. But wait – you probably subscribed to these emails for a reason, didn’t you? Don’t worry: nothing’s being deleted. They’re just being removed as a distraction because, let’s face it, you don’t have time during the workday to browse an endless stream of newsletters. There’s always a later point to catch up. A second tip to lighten your email load is the Do, Delete or Defer Rule. When emails come in, you might waste precious time and mental energy deciding how to handle them. This rule will make your decision process way easier, as you’ll only have three options: do, delete or defer. “Do” means you do something with it immediately. It’s perfect for emails with actionable items that can be completed in five minutes or less, like one from IT about updating privacy settings on your computer. “Delete” is a handy and underrated option. For instance, if someone sends you an email just to say thanks or that they’ve finished a task, don’t respond – delete! Remember: the more emails you send, the more you’ll receive. If more people hit “Delete” instead of “Reply All,” we’d all get fewer emails. “Defer” is the third and final option for all the emails that can’t be dealt with immediately. For example, any email that relies on someone else’s input. Taming your inbox is a great way to free up the mental energy that you’ll desperately need to drive your company forward – for example, by generating new ideas more effectively. Question: What will keep you ahead of your competitors? The answer: your unique ideas. As a founder, you have vast amounts of information at your fingertips. Just think of all the podcasts, websites, newsletters or tweets out there. But this also means that your ideas can spring up at any given moment. And since ideas can be fleeting, you need to have a system in place to capture the very thoughts that can move your business forward. The key message here is: Record and store your ideas in a systematic way.  However you handle your creativity, it’s important to find a system to suit your preferences. For example, if you’re most inspired by videos or podcasts, you may enjoy using videos or voice memos to record your own ideas. And if you’re someone who needs to bounce ideas off a colleague, you may want to make sure you always record your brainstorming sessions. As for the author, he likes to use meetings to generate ideas, and he likes to preserve that information in emails, which he reads, like a digest, at the end of the day. So that’s one way you can capture your ideas. But how do you avoid drowning in a sea of information? A good storage system for ideas should essentially act like an external brain – one that takes the weight off the real brain sitting between your ears. After all, the fewer ideas you try to keep stored in the back of your mind all day, the less likely you’ll forget them. And as a bonus, you’ll have more brain power for other ideas. One excellent kind of external brain is the app called If This Then That, or IFTTT for short. You can use this app to build all sorts of shortcuts between two applications. For example, you could set it up to automatically email you your own voice memos. That way you won’t lose any of your genius ideas. Bill Gates once said, “Content is king.” Even though this was back in 1996, it's equally true today. No matter what business you’re in, great content is crucial to success. After all, it’s the primary way of reaching out to your customers. So, let’s look at how you can up your content game. The first thing you should do is recognize your limitations. If writing is not a strength of yours, then don’t waste a lot of time and effort by struggling through poorly written articles and blog posts. Instead, do what the author did. When he was trying to improve his Less Doing blog, he realized that he had a whole lot of nothing. So he hired someone to do it for him. The key message here is: For great content production, figure out what you do well, and create organizational structures that support your talent. What the author did have was a steady supply of ideas for new blog posts, so it was just a matter of  finding someone who understood his voice who could form his ideas into great articles and posts. This took some time, but in the end it allowed him to produce more content while freeing up time to pursue other projects. Another important aspect is creating an efficient means of production. When the author made his first podcast episodes, the process took around 15 hours. As a result, he could only publish one episode every six weeks and, as you can imagine, it’s tough to build a strong audience with so little content. Once he found a way to largely automate the process, however, he could put out a steady stream of podcasts and build a loyal audience. Here’s how it works in practice: First, the author spends a few hours making the recording. He then saves it in a Dropbox folder, where the editor adjusts the sound quality and adds an intro and an ending. The recording is then uploaded to both SoundCloud and YouTube, at which point subscribers are sent an email announcing the new episode, complete with a link to the podcast. With the right structure in place you can spend a fraction of the time producing your content, which in turn allows you to focus on making your content even better! Even the best content in the world can only take you so far. It’ll wither away unnoticed if you don’t have customers and fans who actively recommend you – and that means building a stable customer base. How do you do that? The key message here is: You’ll attract customers with smooth points of contact and the right free sample.  The first step is analyzing every point of contact your business has with its clients and customers. You’re looking for any way a point of contact can be improved. This includes websites, Facebook pages, customer service email exchanges or phone operators. Once you’ve identified all the points of contact, you can sort them into three categories, or phases of the customer relationship: Before, During and After. The Before category includes all contact points between prospective customers and your business. This might be your website or hearing about you at an industry conference. The During category is for points of interaction with active customers, where you should be making sure your customers are nurtured and treated well. The After category includes contact points with former customers, like a follow-up email asking if they were happy with the service. Don’t neglect these. How you end a transaction with a client will have a great impact on how you’re remembered. In all three phases, the key is providing lead magnets. A lead magnet is something of value that you can provide the customer, often for free, as a way to stoke their interest. Ideally, a lead magnet is not only something desirable but something they’ve already showed interest in. It might be the first few chapters of a book, or the first few minutes of an online course. By piquing a customer’s interest with a taste of free, high-quality content, they’ll be more likely to buy the full package. Another great thing about lead magnets is that they’re usually samples of products that you already have, so this is a perfect task for delegating to someone else. By now, you should have a good idea of how you can make your current business more automated and capable of running without you. This means you’ll have more time to spend on exciting new ideas, and even start working on founding your next business. One of the author’s clients is Justin Kavanaugh, a world-famous trainer to an impressive roster of professional athletes, including many top American football players. Throughout his career, Kavanaugh always took on a lot of work, including many high-profile speaking engagements, and always pushed himself to do more. But when his first child was born, all this changed. He had to start saying no. For someone who had never met a challenge he couldn’t accept, this was hard. In fact, Kavanaugh had to cancel some international speaking engagements he’d already agreed to. Even though it pained him to do so, he knew it was the right thing to do. The most important thing now was staying close to home, being with his child and supporting his wife. The key message here is: Sometimes, the best way forward is to say no and slow down. No matter what your business is, there will be times when slowing down adds more value than speeding up. This is something every founder and CEO needs to know from the get-go. This might mean deprioritizing the fast-paced operations of the sales department, or paying closer attention to more delicate issues like HR or improving customer relations. In the athletes he trained, Kavanaugh experienced first-hand the need to slow down. He regularly saw athletes become successful and then start getting greedy with their efforts. Suddenly, it was all about getting faster, stronger and scoring more points as quickly as possible. That raised the risk of burn-out, and overuse injuries. But whether you’re the founder of a Fortune 500 company or a football superstar, you need to regularly go back to the basics. Keep working on strengthening the skills that made you successful in the first place. The only way to do this is by taking a break every once in a while and calmly reflecting on the parts of your game that need fine tuning. This is how you stay at the top. Founders are always going to be important players in any company; but that doesn’t mean they have to be involved in all the day-to-day operations of the business. In fact, trying to do everything yourself is a sure way to burn out. At the end of the day, it’s your job to set up an organization that can run smoothly on its own, so that you can spend more time following new ideas and leading the way forward. Let’s give the last word to the author, Ari Meisel, who we interviewed in 2016. Here he is, talking about delegation and time: Meisel: The thing is, [delegation] is like a muscle that you have to use. Anything you do more than twice, there should be a process for, and if there's a process they can almost definitely be automated. So that's the thing, you're not aware of what you could possibly be taking advantage of by not having that be part of what you do or even by going through the process of automating it so you don't have to do it.

Osborne made a very sobering prediction: by 2033, up to 47 percent of current jobs could be eliminated from the US economy. The reason? In a word, automation – the process by which jobs are performed, well, automatically, without the need for human labor, thanks to robots, software or other forms of technology. According to the study, jobs as wide-ranging as sports refereeing, telemarketing, bank loan supervising, insurance underwriting, retail sales and even catering have a 95 percent or greater chance of obsolescence. The list goes on and on, touching nearly every industry. Meanwhile, just about every remaining job will be significantly affected by automation, and a whole range of new jobs will be created. Some major economic and societal transformations lie ahead. To give you a better idea of what they might look like, these blinks will take a look at developing trends in nine major industries that run the gamut of the modern global economy: manufacturing, transportation, the service sector, law, banking, healthcare, journalism, education and entertainment. In this blinks, you’ll learn about the jobs most likely to get eliminated; the jobs most likely to survive; and the jobs most likely to be radically transformed. In the 1960s, we saw the rise of industrial robots – automated factory machines that manufacture products without human assistance. But six decades later, the robots haven’t taken over yet. There are still millions of people working in factories. Sure, many of those factories are now in Eastern countries like China, rather than Western countries like the United States. But they’re still around, chugging away – and still powered by human sweat. So it would be reasonable to think that maybe the fears about robots taking over were overblown. Well, think again. Even in the East, industrial robots are on the rise, and factory jobs are starting to disappear. In China alone, there were 189,000 industrial robots in 2014. That number is projected to reach 726,000 in 2019. Indeed, far from being the last bastion of manual factory work, China is now pioneering fully automated factories. In 2017, a cellphone factory in the industrial city of Dongguan replaced 590 of its 650 workers with robots. It then announced its ambition to further reduce its staff to 20 and eventually to zero. The Chinese media hailed the factory as a success story, illustrating the progress of the country’s Made in China 2025 economic plan. One of the aims of that plan is to achieve a “robotic revolution,” in the words of President Xi Jinping. Four factors are helping to fuel that revolution. First, industrial robots are becoming cheaper. Second, Chinese labor is getting more expensive. Third, modern industrial robots’ productivity leaves humans in the dust: the robots can work at higher speeds and with greater precision, 365 days per year, 24 hours per day. The fourth and final factor combines the previous ones with the fact that Chinese factories often make products for Western corporations. Given the lower cost of industrial robots, the higher cost of Chinese labor and the tremendous productivity benefits of automation, those same corporations are now tempted to build their own factories at home in the West. That way, they can eliminate their international shipping costs. Put those four factors together, and Chinese factories have a strong economic motivation to automate their operations. That way, they can lower their prices and keep their corporate clients happy. But numerous factory jobs will probably be lost as a result. Indeed, the World Bank estimates that 77 percent of jobs in China are threatened by automation, many of them in manufacturing. And that’s just the tip of the automatic iceberg. Imagine it’s the near future. You’re a corporation with an army of industrial robots cranking out your products around the clock, eliminating most of your manufacturing labor costs in the process. But you still have one pesky little problem: getting those products into the hands of your customers. Well, that’s where the robots come in again. The transportation industry is about to be revolutionized by autonomous vehicles. You’ve probably heard about the self-driving cars being test driven on the highways of California – but autonomous trucks are also in the works, with lots of money being poured into their development. Otto is one of the companies leading the way, and it was recently bought by Uber for $700 million. By 2025, one-third of all American trucks could be automated. At first, they’ll only be allowed to pilot themselves on highways, but eventually, drivers won’t be needed to navigate trickier local roads either. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States, so that’s going to put a whole lot of people out of work. Around the same time, Uber, Lyft and traditional taxi drivers will start joining the ranks of the unemployed. Here, too, Uber has been leading the charge. In 2014, the company hired almost the entire robotics department from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, where it’s been testing a fleet of self-driving taxis since 2016. Around the same time, Lyft got in on the action, too, with a $500 million investment in autonomous vehicle technology. Delivery drivers are also under threat. Domino’s Pizza is already trialing self-driving food delivery cars, and package delivery drones are being developed by Amazon, FedEx, UPS and DHL. Oh, and speaking of drones, there are automated flying taxis already being built by the Chinese company Ehang, and several of them are already in limited operation in Dubai. The future of automated transportation is coming fast, and it’s being driven by rapidly advancing technology. For example, the sensors in self-driving cars are getting increasingly sophisticated, enabling them to be responsive to unexpected events, like a dog running across a foggy road at night. As a result, from 2015 to 2016, the rate at which human engineers needed to override autonomous vehicles on test drives fell from 0.5 percent to 0.2 percent. Soon, that rate will probably reach zero, at which point, the technology will have fully arrived – probably by the mid-2020s. Unless you’ve been living off-grid for the past decade, you’ve probably made a number of purchases from online retailers, such as Amazon. Of course, millions of other people have been doing the same thing. As a result, brick-and-mortar stores have been dropping like flies. In the United States, just in the first few months of 2017, Radio Shack closed 552 stores; JCPenney, 138; Macy’s, 68 – and the list goes on and on. With each closure, many people also lose their retail jobs. For example, when Macy’s shut down those 68 stores, it also fired 10,100 workers. All in all, about 12 million retail jobs in the United States are currently threatened by the rise of Amazon. And those retail jobs aren’t going to be replaced with Amazon jobs. That’s because the company needs far fewer low-level employees than its brick-and-mortar competitors. Whereas the latter need salespeople, cashiers, security guards and various other employees, Amazon mostly just needs workers to pick up its products from its warehouse shelves and put them onto trucks. And it’s already working on replacing those workers with robots. Now add automated Amazon delivery drones into the mix, quickly bringing the company’s cheap products right to your front door. That’s going to make it even tougher for retail stores to compete with the online giant. As for the stores that survive the e-commerce onslaught, they will be transformed by automation as well. Already, many grocery stores have replaced cashiers with self-checkout systems, and companies are now eyeing other jobs as well. For example, the home improvement company Lowe’s has developed LoweBots: five-foot-tall robots that are equipped with touch screens, speech-recognition technology and wheels that allow it to roll around autonomously. They’re already in operation at some of the company’s stores, where they track inventory and help customers find items. Meanwhile, automation is rapidly taking hold of the other main branch of the service sector: the restaurant industry. Touch-screen ordering tablets are already replacing counter staff and waiters at restaurants like McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. Meanwhile, back in the kitchen, food preparation robots have already debuted at the Zume Pizza chain, which has cut its labor costs in half. Of course, cutting labor costs is a euphemism for getting rid of workers. In the US fast-food industry alone, 3.6 million jobs could be eliminated in the coming years. Factory, retail, restaurant and transportation workers – these are all low jobs on the socio-economic ladder. High-end jobs will be safe from the threat of automation, right? Well, some might be safer, but many of them will also be in peril. Others will be significantly transformed. As a general rule of thumb, the more routinized a job is, the more likely it is to be automated. In other words, the more your job involves doing repetitive actions, the more likely a robot or a computer is to start doing it for you in the coming years. That’s why many lower-end jobs are going to be eliminated; a machine can flip burgers just as well as a human. But the same holds true for many higher-end jobs. Consider the legal profession. Many of the tasks currently performed by lawyers, paralegals and legal secretaries are pretty formulaic. Whether they’re preparing real estate contracts, rental agreements, divorce settlements or wills, these tasks usually involve taking a boilerplate legal document, slightly adapting it to the needs of the client and filling in the blanks with the correct information. With the help of algorithmic software, online legal platforms like RocketLawyer, LegalZoom and LawDepot can do this work automatically by just asking clients a few simple questions. More sophisticated tasks are also beginning to be automated. In 2016, BakerHostetler, one of the largest law firms in the United States, “hired” a robotic lawyer named Ross. Powered by IBM’s Watson supercomputer, Ross can sift through thousands of legal documents in hundreds of databases and make independent decisions about which ones would be most useful to winning a particular case. As a result of automation, 31,000 law-related jobs have been lost in the United Kingdom alone, and another 114,000 will probably disappear in the next two decades. Meanwhile, in the United States, two out of three lawyers could either lose their jobs or see them radically changed in the next 15 years. For example, instead of writing legal documents themselves, human lawyers will just be proofreading and editing documents written by robots like Ross. This is all troubling news if you’re working in the legal profession – but there’s a bright side if you’re a consumer. In the past, only affluent people could afford legal services, such as writing prenuptial agreements. Automation will lower the costs of these services, making them accessible to lower-income people. Nowadays, when you need to do your banking, it’s possible to go for years without ever having to visit a physical branch of your bank. You can update your information and carry out transfers online, and you can deposit and withdraw money from an ATM. Now, remember the meaning of the acronym ATM: Automated Teller Machine. The tasks that are performed by an ATM used to be the exclusive job of human tellers. Those tellers still exist, of course, but in lower numbers today than in yesteryear, thanks to ATMs. In other words, automation has already been present in the commercial banking industry for quite some time, and it’s going to continue gaining steam in the years ahead. To understand why, it’s helpful to recall the reasons that banks exist in the first place. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but one of their essential jobs is to handle money. Now, modern societies are increasingly becoming “cashless” as more and more financial transactions are conducted electronically through credit cards and the like. As the modern economy moves away from physical money (cash), it also moves away from needing physical places to deal with that money (bank branches). Many companies in the banking industry are taking note of this fact and ditching physical banks altogether. The result: entirely virtual banks, such as Schwab.com and Robinhood.com, which are largely run by automated computing systems powered by sophisticated algorithms. You don’t need to be a number-crunching banker to figure out that fewer bank branches equal fewer banking jobs. Indeed, in the developed world, up to 50 percent of all bank branches and their employees could be gone within the next decade. Meanwhile, large investment banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are also becoming automated. They’re putting their services online and replacing their human financial analysts with algorithms. Indeed, JPMorgan Chase has become so invested in this objective that as of 2015, it employs more software engineers and programmers than either Facebook or Twitter – 9,000 out of its 33,000 total employees! The banks’ algorithms are extremely powerful. In just seconds, they can make financial calculations and projections that used to take human analysts hundreds of hours. Within the next decade, they could replace between one-third and one-half of all workers in the financial sector. Have you ever felt sick and Googled your symptoms? Then, like millions of people, you’ve already experienced one of the ways in which automation will transform the future of healthcare. Before online search engines and virtual assistants like Alexa, you probably would have seen your doctor about your symptoms. Now you can find information about their causes and remedies by simply typing a few words into your search bar or saying, “hey, Alexa, how do I perform CPR?” Alexa will already give you precise instructions on how to do things like that, and in the coming years, virtual assistants will become even more sophisticated – capable of answering just about any question you’d ask your family doctor. Meanwhile, we’ll be able to continuously monitor, analyze and improve our health with a variety of sensors and apps built into our smartwatches, cellphones, rings and clothing, along with microchips implanted in our skin. All of these technologies have already been developed to one degree or another. You can monitor your heart rate with a Fitbit, use a cellphone app to diagnose whether a suspicious skin spot is cancerous or not and even wear a posture-improving device that will give you a little electric shock every time you slouch. These are just a taste of things to come. In the near future, as these technologies evolve and proliferate, we’ll be able to track automatically nearly every aspect of our health and self-diagnose nearly every common ailment. And for diagnosing more serious diseases, many hospitals are already using supercomputers like IBM’s Watson. As for medical treatments, once again, the robots are coming – or rather, they’re already here. The Israeli company Mazor Robotics has developed an automated robotic surgeon that’s conducted 25,000 spinal surgeries in the United States. Meanwhile, an American company called Microbot Medical is developing nano-bots. These robots are so tiny that they can swim through the narrow tunnels of your urethra, blood vessels and even the vascular tubes in your brain, cleaning them up and repairing damage as they go. For example, they could remove the plaque from your coronary arteries, which would reduce your risk of having a heart attack. As we’ll see in the next blink, developments like these will radically transform the healthcare industry. With so many innovative medical technologies already here and even more on the horizon, healthcare is going to be just as revolutionized by automation as the other industries we’ve looked at. Up to 80 percent of the work currently done by human doctors could soon be performed by automated systems. But that doesn’t mean that 80 percent of doctors are about to be put out of work. As with the legal profession, it just means that more routine tasks – like doing check-ups and conducting tests – are going to be automated. That will free up doctors to do other, more interesting work. A lot of it will involve playing a support role – essentially acting as a human mediator between patients and the various automated systems that will diagnose their ailments. Let’s say one of those systems detects that you’re genetically predisposed to a certain disease, like Alzheimer’s or diabetes. With that knowledge, you’ll probably want to know how the disease will impact your health. How alarmed should you be about your chances of developing it? With such questions, you’ll want a human doctor to explain things in language that’s easy to understand. In other words, doctors will still have jobs to do: counseling patients and helping them understand the diagnoses delivered by automated systems. Similar robot-support roles will exist in other industries as well. For example, technicians will still be needed to check and repair the sensors of the industrial robots that operate the automated factories of the future. Mechanics will still be needed to fix self-driving vehicles. Human financial advisors will still be needed to answer the more unique questions that people might have about their banking services. And flesh-and-blood lawyers will probably still be desired by higher-income clients, who want (and can afford) more of a “human touch.” Other industries won’t be so lucky, however. For example, remember those touch-screen ordering devices that are showing up in fast-food restaurants? Well, one of the main motivations behind their implementation isn’t just to cut labor costs. It turns out that given a choice between ordering from one of the devices or talking to a person behind the counter, most customers (especially younger ones) prefer the devices. They don’t want a human touch! But in other industries, that touch will be indispensable, and these will be the industries in which the jobs of the future may flourish, as we’ll see in the next blink. As technology automates the more tedious routine tasks that people have to do in their current jobs, it will also free them up to do more interesting work in other fields besides healthcare. One of them is journalism. Artificial intelligence, or AI, programs are already writing news stories – but they tend to be the type of stories that are rather boring for journalists to write. A vivid example of this comes from The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and leading the charge toward automating certain aspects of journalism. In the 2016 US elections, the newspaper used an AI program called Heliograf to cover about 500 local races. How did it work? Well, Heliograf just took a local election story template written by some human journalists and then filled in the blanks with data that a human editor fed to it. For example, if a Democratic candidate won a certain congressional race, Heliograf would automatically insert certain paragraphs into the story template: a paragraph about the candidate's biography, or on how her victory would affect the balance of power in Congress. That might not sound very exciting – and that’s precisely the point. Programs like Heliograf will enable media companies to hand off more mundane journalism to the computers and let journalists concentrate on the more interesting aspects of their profession. There are long-form stories to chase, in-depth interviews to conduct and analytical articles to be written. Those are tasks that AI is far away from being able to accomplish, so humans will still be needed to do them for the foreseeable future. Finally, AI systems will soon start augmenting journalists’ investigative powers. For example, remember the Panama Papers of 2015? It was the largest data leak in history, consisting of 11.5 million documents that detailed the dodgy financial transactions of the world’s richest companies and individuals. That’s far too many documents for journalists to sift through, so the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) created a database with a search engine that enabled them to find the proverbial needles in the haystack. For example, they could type in a particular person’s name and find all of his of her transactions. Now the ICIJ is working on an AI-powered system that would enable them to trace connections between individuals and organizations. The system is expected to be operational sometime in 2019. If there’s one thing you’ve learned from these blinks so far, it’s that automation is going to shake up many industries in the years ahead. Some new jobs will be created, but many others will be eliminated, and the old jobs that survive will be radically transformed. With so much change going on in the economy, people will have to learn how to adapt – updating their skills for their evolving jobs or retraining for brand new careers or even industries, such as virtual reality programming (more on that in the next blink). And that means education is going to be more important than ever before. But education itself is going to be reshaped by automation as well. Yes, we’re talking about robot teachers. There’s already one on the market: Professor Einstein – a small, humanoid robot that bears a striking resemblance to the famous physicist after which it’s named. What does it do? Well, if you ask him, Professor Einstein will tell you in his own words: “I can walk, talk, teach games, forecast weather, and answer all questions about science.” Unfortunately, he can also lose his Wi-Fi connection, which caused him to malfunction when he was on television being interviewed by the author, much to the embarrassment of his creators. So teachers don’t need to worry about losing their jobs anytime soon. But as robots like Professor Einstein improve, they will take over some of the main functions that teachers currently play in the education of students. What are those functions? Well, think about what your teachers did for you when you were in school (the good teachers, at least). If you had a question, they tried their best to answer it. If you didn’t understand their initial answers, they’d try to reframe them – putting the information into a form you could grasp, whether by way of a clever analogy or a nifty diagram. Well, imagine if Professor Einstein could do the same – only, unlike his human counterparts, he’d be available 24/7, and he’d never get tired of answering questions or coming up with new explanations. This would allow human teachers to move away from their current focus on transmitting knowledge and concentrate more on cultivating so-called “softer skills,” such as curiosity, initiative, persistence, cooperativeness, flexibility, empathy and ethical behavior. How could teachers do those things? Well, we’ll see one powerful way in the next and final blink. Imagine you’re a present-day teacher and your students want to learn about astronomy. Well, you could talk to them about it, give them books, show them videos, provide them with a telescope or send them to Google, where they can probably learn much more about the subject than you know, thanks to Google’s search algorithms (another reason why your role as a knowledge-transmitter is already waning). But imagine if you could blast off into outer space and take them on a cosmic field trip to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. Well, you can’t do that for the foreseeable future, but soon you’ll be able to do the next best thing thanks to virtual reality, or VR. The technology is evolving rapidly, and a ton of investment money is pouring into the burgeoning industry. Google already has a VR device on the market, and Facebook bought the Oculus VR headset company for $2 billion in 2014. Investors are salivating at the economic prospects of VR. In a study by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, the financial giants declared that the VR headset would become “the one device to disrupt and rule the world of technology.” Immersive VR video games are on the horizon – and just in time, because, as you know by now, many people will be out of work, and they’ll need something to do. Here’s one possible future: millions of people will be unemployed and supported by a universal basic income. Meanwhile, the people who still have jobs will work much fewer hours, thanks to automation. What will people do with all their newfound free time? They’ll probably spend most of it consuming various forms of entertainment and culture, such as music, television, video games, movies and books. That’s good news for musical artists, filmmakers, writers and other creatives who work in the entertainment and culture industries. Already, those industries employ 29.5 million people around the world – more than the total workers in the United States, Europe and Japanese automotive industries combined! The more people have free time, the more they’ll demand entertainment and culture – and the more the economy will need actors, directors, musicians, producers and so forth to keep people entertained and edified. Thus, though manual labor will largely become a thing of the past, entertainment and culture may well flourish! The key message in these blinks Over the next few decades, automation will likely replace many current workers in manufacturing, transportation, banking, law and the service sector. Along the way, it will create some new jobs that will center around supporting the robots and other automated systems that replaced those workers. Automation will also eliminate some positions and job functions in medicine, journalism and education, but it will also allow workers in those fields to do more interesting work. Finally, automation will expand people’s free time, which will increase the demand for artists and entertainers.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

By breaking down a process into smaller units, and training workers to perform highly skilled and specific tasks, a company can produce better products faster. Yet as you’ll see, division and departmentalization can go too far, having devastating effects on a company’s creativity and flexibility. But the problems are even bigger than that. Silos are in our heads just as much as in our companies. It’s time to bust them for good.  These blinks will show you how and why we build silos in the first place, and explain just how you can take action to modify them for the better, if not break them down altogether. In these blinks, you’ll discover how New York made fires more predictable for fire fighters; how Sony was stuck in an “octopus pot” for too long; and why Facebook insists its new employees head to boot camp. A silo is more than just a physical structure. These deep, narrow columns exist metaphorically not just in social circles but also in our minds – and they are harmful for many reasons. Silos in an organization effectively discourage people from working together. In New York City, various government departments were like silos, to the extent that even the fire department and emergency call operators – two groups that need to talk to each other – couldn’t even tune their wireless communications to the same frequency.  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at the time made it a top priority to better connect various departments. He also pushed for open office spaces, and ensured that the fire department, the finance department and the police investigations department shared data so that his administration could better predict the risk of fire in city-owned buildings.  While it’s certainly logical to share data and cooperate within a large organization like a city administration, it’s still a challenge. People tend to live and socialize within silos, choosing to stay within particular groups, usually made up of people who are similar to us.  We’re also encouraged to specialize as the business world becomes more complex. We value the opinions of experts, for example, even though they work with others in their fields' “silos.”  These sorts of specialized silos do have positive aspects, too. Silos help us organize our social lives, our workplaces, our economic systems and institutions, and lead to greater accountability.  But this increased accountability is a part of the problem, especially in the workplace. When teams are only accountable for their particular part of a project, they can become competitive or restrictive about data, wasting resources or worse, miscalculating risks. Broadly defined, anthropology is the study of human beings. Social and cultural anthropology focuses on society and culture, whereas physical anthropology focuses on evolution and human biology. The discipline split into these two fields in the twentieth century. Before this, anthropologists sought to understand how a “primitive” person transformed into a more “modern” individual. Often at the time, non-Western societies were considered by default as “primitive.” In the twentieth century, however, anthropologists began to conduct “participant observation” of non-Western societies, realizing that such groups maintained their own social systems and cultural norms, which were different from Western models but still functioned in a similar way.  French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, one of the more influential intellectuals of his time, was involved with anthropological research in Algeria yet had a moment of clarity when he returned to France. Together with an Algerian student, he began to study French society. The pair found they had greater insight into French culture, as one was an “insider” and one an “outsider.” In his research, Bourdieu discovered that France too had its own kind of cultural dogma.  Based on his research, Bourdieu developed a number of social theories. He postulated that a society’s physical space, its population and its culture are determined by its patterns of thought and its systems of classification. Nobody deliberately creates these patterns; yet the patterns do help to maintain social strata, for example.  Furthermore, a society isn’t just determined by the ideas it shares and identifies but also by the ideas it hides: taboos.  So society shapes us, but doesn’t trap us. We can reflect our own cultural norms or even overcome them, if we choose to do so. These ideas, based on anthropological studies that penetrate the reasons behind cultural categories and societal perspectives, can better help us understand how silos work in the modern day.  To come up with new ideas, people need space to be creative, freely exchanging ideas with other people from different disciplines. Silos, however, discourage all of this.  Most large organizations are divided into silos that work independently, making it difficult for silos to collaborate or efficiently communicate.  As one example, Japanese technology giant Sony was once a leading international firm, with revolutionary products sold all over the world. Today, however, the company is a shadow of its former self. What happened? Sony lost its creative drive after it grew too large. Founded just after World War II, Sony was at first a small, dynamic firm. In the early 1990s, new leadership decided to manage company growth by subdividing its divisions into self-sufficient, specialist units: silos. This was in line with a prevailing trend at the time. Companies were seen as collections of smaller, separate businesses, each with their own balance sheet. Yet this shift made the separate departments less willing to take risks, as they now had more responsibility. It also hindered communication between departments. This is why in 1999, Sony launched three different gadgets that played digital music. Each device was based on a different standard, as each was produced by a different division of the company. Sony was effectively competing against itself! It’s very difficult to restructure a company once silos are in place. Sony tried to fix the problem by hiring Howard Stringer, the company’s first CEO who wasn’t originally from Japan. When Stringer told the board the company had too many silos, his translator struggled as there was no word for “silo” in Japanese. The team eventually began referring to silos in Japanese as “octopus pots.” An octopus pot is essentially a silo, a narrow column that an octopus can get into, but can’t escape from. This image helped employees understand the concept of silos – but organizational issues still remained. It’s dangerous when one department in a company doesn’t know what other departments are doing. This creates problems, such as the inability to correctly assess business risks.  The Swiss financial services company UBS learned this the hard way during the 2008 financial crisis, when one of its silos caused the company’s downfall.  Earlier in 2005, the company created a new department for securitizations, a highly specialized market in which mortgages were packaged as bonds and traded. While the department was small, its financial activity was enormous; the bonds too held an AAA credit rating, the highest level.  However, when the crisis hit, those bonds were no longer considered a safe investment. Suddenly no one wanted to buy them; and UBS incurred huge losses. UBS could have avoided this situation if its separate departments had shared more information, but its staff across different silos had no incentive to do so; their salaries depended only on the performance of their own departments. In the end, UBS lost over $10 billion because of one silo located in its US branch, which executives at the company’s Swiss headquarters hardly even knew about. Silos also make it hard for economists and regulators to accurately assess the workings of the global economy. This was crucially the case with the appearance of new financial entities that didn’t fit old classification systems. These new, highly capitalized companies weren’t banks, as they didn’t take deposits or make loans; they weren’t hedge funds, as they didn’t officially invest in risky assets. As a result, these twenty-first century financial entities were just considered “other financial corporations,” slipping through both the naming and regulatory cracks.  Which is one of the many reasons why the 2008 financial crisis was so brutal and so abrupt. Industry types were focused only on their own silos; and within each silo, the world was rosy. The silos encouraged “tunnel vision” and prevented anyone from seeing the growing market risks.  Silos aren’t just inside your company, they’re also inside your mind.  That’s why silo-busting starts with you. If you’re a trained computer expert, for example, this speciality probably affects your social and cultural silo. You can break this silo down by sharing your expertise with other fields.  Personal silo-busting means interacting more with people who are different from you, both socially and professionally. Brett Goldstein, a trained computer expert from Chicago, decided after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York to work with Chicago police. He used his skills to analyze Chicago’s murder statistics, as teams across different districts weren’t sharing information to accurately follow changes in gang behavior.  Goldstein’s skills helped police better predict the possibility of gang conflict escalating to killings. He helped to break down silos in the police force while at the same time, breaking down his own.  Interestingly, more often than not police organizations as well as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are prone to overusing silos. It’s possible that if different security agencies had communicated better about the activities of al-Qaeda operatives, 9/11 may have been avoided.  There’s another important benefit of silo-busting, in that it can earn you a lot of money. The hedge fund BlueMountain Capital came up with an effective silo-busting strategy. The fund analyzed different markets to see when major investors through their activities were creating distortions in market prices, then bet against them. The fund knew that silos within banks often incentivize traders to do things that might make sense on a micro-level, but often don’t benefit the bank as a whole. Thus traders within bank silos sometimes work too much within one market, creating market price distortions.  So BlueMountain Capital kept an eye on market giant JPMorgan as in 2012 it went deep into highly volatile credit default swaps, and proceeded to lose billions in the process. BlueMountain zigged while JP Morgan zagged, and in the process, earned itself a ton of cash. Not every company is a mute collection of silos. Social media giant Facebook, for example, has been quite successful in avoiding the creation of impermeable silos within the company while still harnessing the advantages of concentrated, specialized work.  All new Facebook employees go through the same six-week course known as boot camp, no matter their rank or department. They all learn the same information, work together and get to know each other. The boot camp experience creates long-lasting bonds that remain, even when employees go off to their separate units. Facebook also holds weekly meetings and hosts social events to make sure employees keep interacting and sharing with each other. The company strives to maintain the positive aspects of silos by keeping separate teams that have the freedom to collaborate and work creatively, while not allowing the company to fragment too much. Facebook also has a program called Hackamonth, a way to shake up unproductive silos. After an employee spends one year working on a project, he joins a different team for about a month. About half of reassigned employees stay with their new teams and the rest return to their previous positions.  Sure, a Hackamonth costs money and time, but it keeps the company interconnected and allows more ideas to flow, fostering creativity too! Facebook also knows that separate teams in large companies often fall into competing with each other. That’s why it holds hackathons about every six weeks. In a hackathon, several hundred engineers gather in a small space for one night and focus on coding-related problems. As an added twist, hackathon participants never collaborate with the same colleagues they usually work with.  Despite all these efforts, there’s still a danger that Facebook could become one giant silo of its own. Only the introduction of new people and new ideas can prevent this. When you go to the hospital, you know what hurts – but you don’t necessarily know which kind of doctor you might need to make the pain go away.  One of the biggest and most renowned medical centers in the United States, the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, took seriously the idea of breaking down silos and revolutionized itself in the process. CEO Delos Cosgrove measured progress mostly in technical and economic terms until he heard that patients were choosing less-qualified clinics over the Cleveland Clinic because they felt clinic doctors weren’t personal or empathetic enough.  So Cosgrove started silo-busting by asking patients what they valued, and learned that personal service was very important to them. He then reexamined how the clinic ran as well as its approach to medicine in a broader sense. He began to question the classification system medical professionals used to assess their field. The Cleveland Clinic’s restructuring wasn’t just about mental reorganization, either. It also broke down the distinction between nurses and doctors by calling both “caregivers” and created new, multidisciplinary institutes that focused on certain body systems, like the Head and Neck Institute. These new institutes connected surgeons and physicians from different fields, a revolutionary step. Prior to this, a cardiac surgeon for example had never worked with a cardiologist! The Cleveland Clinic’s reorganization was possible because its employees received fixed salaries, which is unusual in the United States. The clinic still maintained a hierarchy and different salary groups, but the stability in pay allowed different physicians and surgeons to collaborate in new and important ways.  Ultimately, the clinic restructured itself to suit a patient's needs, not the institution's needs. The key message in this book: Humans have developed silos as a natural response to the increasing complexity of the world. Though they have their benefits, silos often blind us to risks and stifle our creativity. So we need to engage in silo-busting, both in our own minds and in society, too. When people from different silos come together and collaborate, they can produce great innovations.  Actionable advice: Take control of your silos instead of letting them control you. We can’t and shouldn’t abolish silos completely; we still need specialists in our world. However, we can master silos instead of letting them master us, by regularly reexamining and reorganizing our social, cultural and mental systems. Remember: silos are only useful in the short-run. The danger is when they become fixed.

Covey with Rebecca R. Merrill","summary":"“I trust you.” What does that mean? For many of us trust is something like love: an abstract, rather fluffy thing. But this isn’t true: trust is a concrete, measurable factor. And it’s an asset that we should spend more time cultivating. These blinks highlight the benefits you can expect if you spend time growing trust in your relationships. Whether you run a business or just want to improve your personal interactions with others, reading this advice can help change your life. In these blinks you’ll learn why it’s better to behave with integrity than win at all costs; why every time you go through airport security, you are paying a trust tax; and how you should forgive those who betray you...to a certain extent. Pick up a newspaper and you’ll immediately be confronted by headlines about fading trust in banks, corporations and relationships. Trust affects everything. But what is it exactly and how does it affect us so much? Trust can be defined as the confidence you have in someone. When you trust others, you feel assured in their abilities to do something, such as paying back that $100, or staying faithful to you in a partnership. Trust is beneficial to us, as it facilitates good communication. For example, it’s far easier to understand someone when you trust them. You’ve probably experienced times when your best friend (whom you trust) understands what you’re saying even when you aren’t speaking clearly. Conversely, you’ll find it harder to understand what people you’re not so familiar with are talking about, even if they’re speaking in plain terms. Aside from our friendships, if we can achieve trust through improved communication, it’s excellent for business. Interestingly, trust enables us to do things more quickly at a lower cost. This is known as the economics of trust. For example, before 9/11, it took Americans 30 minutes to get through airport security for national flights. After 9/11, as trust rapidly declined, security clearance required an hour and a half. Due to the fear of terrorist attacks (lowered trust), everything started to take longer (lowered speed), and as a result, expenses for security machines and personnel rose (increased costs). So we see that the traditional economic formula of strategy x execution = results is inadequate. An element of trust must be added, and this comes in two forms. One is a trust tax, for relationships experiencing waning trust. Another is a trust dividend, if there’s a high level of trust. The formula then would be (strategy x execution) x trust = results. So in the airport security line, the equation would therefore involve a trust tax, which would lead to a slower, less efficient end process. Distrust generates many problems. Cultivating self-trust is crucial; if you can’t trust yourself, how can anyone else trust you? To foster self-trust, you need to make yourself credible by adopting The Four Cores. The first is Integrity. This entails being honest, standing by your principles and doing what you say you’ll do. A fantastic example is Andy Roddick, who displayed integrity in a 2005 tennis match. At match point, his opponent’s serve was called “out” and Roddick proclaimed the winner. Then he shocked everyone by showing that the ball was actually “in.” The game continued and Roddick ending up losing the match, but he had kept his integrity. One way to increase integrity is to make and keep commitments to yourself, even if it just means consistently getting up when your alarm clock goes off every morning. Sticking with a simple commitment like this will increase your self trust. The second core is Intent, meaning positive motives and behavior. For example, research comparing professions we trust showed that we trust NGOs more than politicians, largely due to the common belief that NGO motives are generally conscientious. You can improve intent by analyzing and redefining your motives, asking questions like “Am I really listening to this person or do I just want to win the argument?” The third core is Capabilities. That is, developing abilities that evoke confidence. For example, a child who learns a musical instrument is likely to possess higher self-confidence, which can benefit other areas in their life. One way to improve your capabilities is to keep learning. Try reading up on new developments in your industry or doing your own research in an area you’re interested in. The last core is Results, where you build a track record of deeds to which you’ve committed yourself. FedEx, for instance, has a respectable reputation for actually delivering overnight as they promise. Because of this, we trust their delivery methods and so does the company itself. By working on these core principles, we develop our own self-trust and in the end this helps others to trust us too. To establish trust in your relationships, you need to behave in a trustworthy way. How many times do we really believe the skirt-chaser who uses charm and excessive flattery? To make your word hold more weight than the skirt-chaser’s, here are two things you can do: First, tell the truth. Omitting information, double-talking, or spinning stories are all different ways we avoid speaking the whole truth, even if we’re not lying outright. The problem is, this behavior erodes trust, whereas being candid increases it. If you’ve got a reputation for being dishonest, you’ll make it hard for yourself to keep good relationships. Another thing you can do is demonstrate respect for others by showing them you care. When people think you really care about them, they’re less likely to believe you want to con them, and will start putting faith in you. So how can you show you care? You can do the tried-and-true thank you notes, acknowledge the contributions of people around you, be generous in giving acknowledgement, and avoid bad-mouthing people. Bear in mind, though, that you’ll undo all the good that comes from this behavior if you overdo it! We all appreciate a straight and honest talker, but stating clearly how much you hate your friend’s new romantic partner, for example, is simply hurtful. Avoid going overboard, otherwise you will strain your relationships and weaken your trust levels. The following analogy will help you see clearly if you are creating or destroying trust. Try thinking of your efforts in terms of a trust account. When you act in a trustworthy way, you make a “deposit.” When you act to the contrary, you make a “withdrawal.” The aim here, then, would be to stay in credit! This means asking others for feedback on your behavior. Doing so will help you gauge how you are progressing and where you can improve. This way you’ll receive and maintain trust from others. In business, you’re often told you need to please your stakeholders, but what does this mean exactly? Stakeholders can be divided into three types: internal (employees), external (the market), and societal (other members of society who judge your business). Each of these stakeholders require different approaches in order for them to trust you and your business. In order for internal stakeholders (employees) to trust an organization, they need to observe alignment. This means that the organization must act in a trustworthy way. When they do so, the trust that results is beneficial for all. When employees trust each other, they communicate better, which increases efficiency and results in company growth and even pay raises. To instill trust in external stakeholders, a good reputation is paramount. Winning the trust of the market involves focusing on your brand or reputation. For example, Chinese products are unfortunately perceived as less trustworthy than British, German or French products, because they have a reputation for being somewhat inferior and unreliable. Perhaps you can recall a time when you bought a Made in China coat, only to have its buttons and threads come loose a few days later. For the third type of stakeholder – the societal stakeholder – trust is developed through contribution. A company which has a reputation for doing good by contributing to society will be well loved and respected. In late 1992 a police assault on construction worker Rodney King instigated riots in Los Angeles, California. Amongst all the burned and looted buildings, only the McDonald’s restaurants were left unscathed. When asked why this was the case, locals stated that McDonald’s had supported literacy initiatives and sports programs in the community and had always offered jobs for youth in the area. Rioters hadn’t touched McDonald’s because the chain had created societal trust. Once trust has been lost, many of us think it’s lost forever. But in fact, trust can be restored. Let’s take a look at how. Regaining and even strengthening trust takes effort, commitment and the extension of smart trust. Smart trust lies in the middle ground between distrust and naive gullibility, and combines the following elements: an inherent feeling that others are generally worthy of trust, and a close look at the possible implications of trusting someone. Say you are about to go into business with someone who has previously betrayed you. Although we’d normally be right to approach every situation with the hope that everyone involved is inherently trustworthy, and to forgive any wrongdoings, diving straight into a joint venture with this person would demonstrate a lack of learning on our part. Practicing smart trust in this case would mean we wouldn’t trust this person unless we’re confident they’ve learned from their mistakes. Until then, it wouldn’t make sense to trust them completely. Extending smart trust also shows others that they can trust us in return, and in this way damaged relationships can be rebuilt. Trust can also be restored by improving your credibility. It isn’t possible for us to “fix” someone else’s opinions about us and force them to trust us, so we have to try other means of rebuilding trust. Even if you’ve jeopardized someone’s trust, you can make an effort to regain it by behaving in a way that improves your credibility. The author’s son, for instance, was permitted to use the family car on the condition that he didn’t drive over the speed limit, yet he was caught doing exactly that. However, he displayed credibility by working hard to pay off the speeding ticket and therefore restored the trust of his family. The key message in this book: Trust is a universal asset that can be created by every one of us. Trust changes everything for the better by speeding up interactions and lowering costs. If we conduct ourselves in ways that promote trust, it will flourish and we will witness the difference in our companies and our personal relationships. Actionable advice: The little things count. The next time you want to show others you care and wish to gain their trust, remember that it’s often the small gestures that go a long way. Taking a little time to call them, or taking them aside at work to acknowledge their efforts will help build their trust in you.

But don’t blame the job itself. If you take the right approach, any role has the potential to become a meaningful one. In The Truth about Employee Engagement, Lencioni explores the effects unhappy employees can have on the success of a business, as well as the employee’s family and social life. You’ll learn to identify the three root causes of job dissatisfaction and gain the tools you need to improve your own – and other people’s – work lives. No matter what your job, whether you’re managing or being managed, you can benefit from the advice in these blinks. In these blinks, you’ll learn what a withered plant has to do with an unhappy employee; why your boss should ask about your after-work pottery class; and that a garbage collector may well be happier than Madonna. What does it mean when somebody tells you they have a bad job? There are lots of reasons they might feel less than happy with their role. It might leave them physically exhausted or offer low pay. But there are less obvious reasons why people might be dissatisfied. Say you land a job in the sector in which you’ve always dreamed of working or secure a move to a position with an attractive salary. Neither of these things can guarantee job satisfaction. Have you ever found yourself heading to work each morning, dreading arriving at the office? Have you ever counted the hours all day long, waiting for it to be over? Then you’ve had a miserable job that may have left you feeling deeply cynical, without motivation to apply yourself or perform well. It has nothing to do with the job title or the sector; a doctor can be just as miserable as a construction worker. A professional sportsperson might be as disillusioned as an amusement park designer. A wealthy executive might be deeply unhappy in her job, whereas the waiter who serves her lunch may find his job deeply rewarding. You get the picture. Being so unhappy in your job obviously has a personal cost – your general well-being. What isn’t as obvious is the high cost to companies. Let’s look at efficiency. There’s plenty of research to show the negative impact dissatisfied employees can have on a company’s efficiency. When a worker is less engaged and less happy with their work, they’re less likely to perform well, and both employee and company will suffer. Not only that – an unhappy employee’s misery and cynicism will filter into their home life, affecting their partner and children. The same people are also more likely to find it hard to perform their other social responsibilities, such as caring for loved ones and taking part in the wider community. If we’re going to solve job misery, we’ll first have to understand what causes it. Luckily, the next blink has the answer. Picture a plant. If the roots are rotten, no nutrients can be absorbed, the rot spreads to the rest of the plant and the whole thing soon withers and dies. Well, it’s much the same for humans in bad jobs. Three different rotten roots can potentially cause good jobs to wither into dismal ones. The first of these roots is anonymity. People need to have their efforts recognized to feel valued. It’s crucial that somebody – ideally their employer – takes the time to understand their potential and appreciate their abilities. When people feel invisible, and that their presence wouldn’t be missed, they become despondent. The second root problem is irrelevance. When you do a job that makes a positive impact on other people – even if it’s just one other person – you feel your work is worthwhile. If nobody is benefitting from your work, you will feel as though your efforts are pointless. The final root of job misery is immeasurement. This comes about when people have nothing against which to measure their achievements. If you don’t know what your goal is, how can you determine whether you have achieved it? It helps to have a clear idea of what it looks like to perform well, and what can be done to improve. Otherwise, you will end up without motivation and ultimately dissatisfied. It’s not just those at the bottom of the ladder who experience anonymity, irrelevance and immeasurement; even managers can be affected by the root causes of job misery. To illustrate this point, imagine the leader of the marketing section of a software company. Let’s call her Nancy. Nancy has quite a powerful job, but she’s miserable. Why is that? Well, she reports directly to the CEO, who is so busy that she has no time to take an interest in Nancy’s professional development or personal life. She feels anonymous. Nancy also fails to see how the company is of any help to its customers. She’s not even sure her work makes a difference within her team. She feels irrelevant. And even though Nancy recognizes the company is performing well – as shown by performance data – Nancy has no way to measure her contribution to the company’s success. This is immeasurement. All three root causes of job misery have combined to leave Nancy feeling deeply unhappy. Say you’re running a business. It’s not making enough profit – what do you do? Look for cheaper suppliers? Use more efficient production methods? Maybe you should take a look at your staff first – increasing employee engagement can solve many problems. The most obvious benefit of employee engagement is higher productivity. When people feel that their job has meaning, they’re much more willing to take responsibility to get things done. This may involve working longer hours or being more diligent, which will mean more accurate, higher-quality results. The less obvious – but equally important – benefit is that engaged employees will stay loyal to their company. They will even recommend it to other good employees. In the long term, this will save the company time and money on training and recruitment. It’s also worth bearing in mind in these highly competitive times that having a reputation for fostering a positive workplace can boost a company’s profile. This is easily done by looking after your employees and making sure they’re motivated. Doesn’t this all sound like common sense? Well, sadly, there are many obstacles to overcome to achieve such employee engagement. As the employee, you might focus solely on salary and promotion prospects when choosing a role. While these are important, it’s even more crucial to find out if the company will be a good cultural fit for you. Does it support employees’ development? Does it nurture their existing talents? On the other hand, the main obstacle for employers is an inability to communicate. It can be awkward for an employer to ask questions that require an emotional response, particularly questions about how an employee is feeling or whether they’re enjoying their work. Luckily, this is a skill that can be developed if managers work a little harder every day to make sure their employees stay engaged. What do you have in common with megastars like Madonna? More than you’d think. In spite of wealth and success, many actors and movie stars find themselves dissatisfied – under constant pressure to reinvent themselves because of a deep fear of becoming irrelevant. This fear affects office workers just as much as Grammy Award winners. Employers can do a lot to help their employees feel needed. Firstly, by making sure each employee knows what their contribution is. For example, employers might encourage their employees to ask “Who am I helping?” In the hospitality industry, the answer is straightforward: the customer. But even though it’s clear who they’re helping, it’s important to remind employees that their work is having an impact by making sure to relay customer feedback to them. It’s not quite as easy to motivate employees who aren’t working directly with customers, such as secretaries and office assistants. Their work largely benefits just one person directly – the boss. In this situation, it’s a good idea for the boss to motivate employees by acknowledging how their hard work makes her life easier. As well as making the effort to give praise, employers need to get to know their employees. Employees whose bosses take an interest in them will feel more satisfied in their roles. So what’s the best way to make an employee feel listened to? Easy – just take time to sit down and talk. It may be hard to overcome workplace formality at first. When recruiting, managers are trained not to ask candidates personal questions in interviews. However, managers should get to know their staff. This includes their dreams, what motivates them, and important events in their home life. Sadly, managers often neglect to do this, but taking a genuine interest in colleagues and checking in with them regularly is one of the most effective ways to raise employee engagement. “Great job!” That’s the sort of thing you might hear from a manager trying to keep you motivated. It’s nice, but it’s not enough. Employers need to be a lot more specific in their praise. Why? Because employees need to know exactly what their contribution is to feel their work is worthwhile. This often involves playing on the human element of any job. Take a worker at an airport hotel. It may be their job to deliver breakfast trays to guests’ rooms. If they only see their job as delivering food, they won’t find much satisfaction in the task. But if they understand that the guests receiving the breakfast have likely been traveling for hours, are very tired, and that having breakfast outside their door will make a huge difference to their day, the job suddenly becomes much more meaningful. Accounting might not seem like the most caring of professions, but an accountant may have just as great an impact on other humans. Say a sick person has lost the receipt from a doctor’s appointment but needs to be reimbursed as soon as possible. If the accountant helps find that receipt, she’s not only finding a piece of paper; she’s also giving the patient peace of mind. That lets the patient take a break from worrying about their finances and spend their time on something enjoyable. It should be part of the employer’s job to remind employees who they’re helping. As well as having a clear idea of who benefits from their hard work, employees need to be able to measure their contribution. It’s very important that success isn’t measured by how happy a superior is with the work. If success is evaluated subjectively like this, it creates a competitive environment, with people playing politics and sucking up to the boss. Instead, employees should be able to track their progress using clear metrics. It’s no use giving individuals the general company revenue target to aim for; there should be a feedback system. This allows employees – like the hotel worker – to get direct feedback from customers. The hotel worker was just a quick example. Let’s look at some more examples in the next blink. You’ve already heard why a glamorous job isn’t necessarily a happy one, just as a menial job isn’t always miserable. If you need convincing further, here are some more examples of how to make any job more meaningful. What about a box boy? The boy in this example is called Josh. He works at the supermarket packing customers’ bags and carrying them to the car. Josh may be at the bottom of the hierarchy, but the boss would be unwise to treat him anonymously. The boss might start a conversation, find something the two have in common and by doing so increase Josh’s interest in and loyalty to the store. Josh could also make the work more interesting for himself by giving the customers extra benefits, such as a weather report or an inspiring quote while he’s doing his job. Now let’s look at the other end of the hierarchy and consider the job of a star athlete. In this case, he’s called Michael, and he plays American football. Michael’s lucky enough to earn several million dollars each year, but he’s not necessarily a happy man. Major athletes, like Michael, are treated like commodities – traded anonymously by clubs and agents for huge fees. Moving to a new city, working with a new coach, the star athlete risks feeling very lonely, unless the new coach makes an effort to get to know Michael personally. The other occupational hazard is that Michael loses sight of what he’s doing for others. Playing a sport can come to seem irrelevant. Even if Michael and his teammates have thousands of followers on social media, or receive media praise for their playing record, this is no replacement for personal feedback. That means it’s up to the coaches and managers to remind sportspeople how much they’re valued by the fans who watch their games. A win will keep the supporters happy through the whole week, and keeping that in mind can make all the difference. What do you think of when you think of service? An underpaid waiter serving a rich diner? An ordinary worker serving a more powerful manager? Actually, service should go both ways, and managers should aim to serve their employees. When you’re a manager in a corporate organization, it’s easy to feel you’re not as generous or caring as a nurse or a doctor. But don’t forget that managers are in a position to give a great deal to their employees. To do this, they have to make an effort to improve the well-being of their employees – physically and mentally – to ensure they have the best possible working conditions. The great news is that everybody benefits in this situation; the employees feel valued and motivated, while the manager enjoys the satisfaction of having improved the well-being of many people and their families. Making changes needn’t be intimidating either. There are a wealth of simple things managers can do to be of service to their staff. First, a manager should take a look at what they’re already doing to make their employees feel good. They can do this by asking how well they really know their employees, whether they are aware of their hobbies, passions and home life. It’s also the manager’s responsibility to put measures in place that will keep each employee aware of their contribution to the company, so they can keep track of the impact their work is having. But managers shouldn’t just trust their own feelings. They need to ask for feedback to see which areas still leave room for improvement when it comes to helping employees find meaning in their work. If there are shortcomings, then the manager can make a decisive plan of action for changes. This will involve further discussions with individuals and the whole team. If individuals and managers alike make the effort to connect and make each other feel valued, both people and business will thrive. The key message in these blinks: Don’t put up with a miserable job – find a way to make it meaningful. Managers and employees alike have the tools to bring joy and meaning to each other’s work. The key is to focus on your impact on other people, what you contribute to the whole, and have a clear way of measuring your success. The more engaged the employees, the more successful the business.  Actionable advice: Find a meaningful job.  If you’re job-searching, it’s wise to ensure there’s potential for the role for which you’re applying to be meaningful. You can do this at the interview stage. Tell prospective employers that you’d like to know them better and that you want them to know you. Tell them you need a clear vision of what your work is doing for others and a clear way to measure success. If they don’t seem interested in answering the questions, that’s a red flag. Find a company that can offer you a workplace where you’ll look forward to arriving every morning. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Our food is fast, our communication is instant, and we work in a constant hurry. Unfortunately, all of this rushing about is not good for us. It leaves us stressed and unhappy. Not only that, but it also destroys our creativity. So what can we do? These blinks help explain how we can step off this treadmill. They lay out the benefits of giving ourselves and our brains time to be creative. By following this simple advice, we can start becoming happier and more innovative people. In these blinks, you’ll learn why social media isn’t good for us; why universities are harming our creative abilities; and why we need to find time for sleep.   In the last 20 years, the line between people’s working and social lives has blurred. The primary reason for this change is social media. Frankly, it’s transformed human behavior. Being connected has become increasingly important: how often do you interrupt what you’re doing to check your news feed, emails and other means of communication? In 2015, Adobe surveyed more than 400 US-based white collar workers aged 18 and older. More than half of the millennials who participated checked their personal email from work and vice versa. Social media has changed how people think about the world. Thanks to algorithms and targeted news pieces, your feeds are populated with content catered to you. Individuals tend to know little about issues outside their own interests. This is why young people often know more about Kim Kardashian’s life than the candidates in a presidential election. Interestingly, women are more active on social media. Compared to men, they delegate more time to staying connected with online friends and following brands they support. In January 2014, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey in conjunction with Women’s Marketing, Inc, and SheSpeaks. The results showed that women are more likely to use social media to advertise their lives and buy products from brands they follow. In addition, the survey found that 46 percent of women look at their smartphone first thing in the morning while 31 percent check their computers. This increased amount of online engagement leads to more stress. The Pew Research Center noticed that social media allows for a higher awareness of others’ lives, which can promote stressful feelings. As women are naturally more susceptible to stress, social media has a greater effect on them. It’s drastically changed the way that people act and communicate. As modern life is always rapidly changing, people need to adapt to thrive. Unfortunately, the tools needed to do so are not being taught. When it comes to higher education, universities and colleges tend to teach the theory pertaining to a subject rather than how to approach it in a constructive, creative way. This practice of focusing on a narrow theory base during teaching means that graduates are often left without the ability to use their creativity in a practical way. This idea is supported by the award-winning interior designer Vanessa Brady. She noticed that most design colleges neglect to teach a personal finance course because they adhere too closely to the rigid constraints of design theory. By refusing to teach the practicalities of business to students, the universities are essentially limiting the creative potential of their alumni. Another aspect which universities tend to neglect is communication. As previously discussed, social media is changing how young people interact – these days, they tend to express themselves via texts and emojis. Texting is even the preferred method to calling, as the latter is seen as too intrusive because it doesn’t allow the person on the other end of the line to deal with the information in their own time. This lack of spoken or face-to-face communication grossly alters what people say to one another. In fact, the internet has led to a phenomenon that psychologist John Suler dubs toxic disinhibition. This is the notion that because the recipient of the message isn’t physically present, an individual is more likely to make statements online that they would be far too embarrassed or ashamed to say in real life. In essence, the education system needs to rethink its teaching methods to properly equip young people with the skills they need to face the problems posed by contemporary living. As you’ve learned, social media can have a detrimental effect on your happiness. But what can be done to combat this? Nowadays, to achieve contentment, you must understand how your brain works. The brain has two hemispheres which tackle tasks. The left brain deals with processes such as critical thinking, analysis and language, while the right brain manages creative functions like recognizing faces, colors and reading emotions. They tend to work together. When you meet a new person, the left brain analyzes aspects such as their gestures and how they’re dressed. After ten minutes, if you feel an affinity toward them, your left brain will relax, and your right brain will kick in to allow for emotions like empathy and friendliness. The way you use your brain can change how it functions, because the parts you use most often are strengthened. For example, say your goal is to enhance your creativity. To bolster it, do other right-brain activities like writing and dancing. However, you have to be careful not to overload your brain, as this can have a negative impact on both your creativity and health. It’s important to rest your brain to have a healthy creative mind. As it’s a passive activity, sleep is frequently overlooked when it comes to improving creativity and overall health. It’s often seen as a waste of time, so many people go without it and push themselves to the limit until serious health problems arise. Sleep restores the brain and improves its processes. People who capitalize on sleep tend to have triple the creative and cognitive power of those who don’t. Take former US president Bill Clinton. He worked so exhaustively that he ended up having a heart attack. In hindsight, he even realized that he made mistakes because of tiredness. It’s vital to take care of your brain to boost your creativity. As life is so hectic these days, it’s difficult to find the necessary space and time to allow your mind to wander and strike upon a creative idea. Everyone’s looking for the game-changing solution, but the fear of failure serves as a roadblock. The ideal conditions for creativity come when the left brain, which is responsible for processing worry and fear, is distracted by routine or habit. This allows the creative right brain the freedom to ruminate. That’s why your best ideas are created when you’re doing menial activities like walking your dog or having a shower. However, with the right tactics, you can train your fear-inducing left brain to switch off. In order to harness your creativity in the face of fast-pace modern life, use these Eight Creative Traits: quiet, engage, dream, relax, release, repeat, play and teach. Sometimes, doing nothing is the perfect way for new ideas to come to light. Try to have a quiet moment – sit alone without your devices and allow yourself to daydream to boost your imagination. Alternatively, adding some basic activities to your schedule also helps – have a relaxing bath or cook a meal at home. Remember not to rush the process. It takes a lot longer than you think to truly engage with your creative side. When it comes to creative thinking itself, though, take a less serious approach. Play with your ideas to really engage your right brain. It’s also essential to repeat your creative routine to get to grips with your new skills. And finally, teach others about your passion. This will allow you to think more about your area of interest – who knows what ideas might come to mind as you do so! Creativity and success are one and the same – they come from your sensibility and your capacity to tap into your instinct. As soon as you learn to listen to your instinct, you’ll be able to use it to benefit your life. One person who can vouch for this practice is Sinclair Beecham. He co-founded and built the highly successful chain Prêt à Manger. Along with his partner Julian Metcalfe, Beecham made the humble sandwich a healthier and more accessible food option. His idea was so successful because he instinctively thought it’d be best to focus on what makes people happy rather than how to make a profit. If you can understand what makes people happy, a good profit will follow. However, if you solely focus on making a profit, you’ll inevitably waste time and money. To consistently make people happy, Beecham chose to strictly follow his instinct. He discovered that after years of using his brain for analytical purposes, his best ideas would come as he was not working. In fact, going out into the world and simply being can be a better educational journey in terms of exercising your creativity than going to university. You should endeavor to experience as much of the world as you can – that way, you’ll generate thoughts and ideas that’ll reinforce your creativity later in life. As the Global Creative Chair at Edelman, a communications market leader, Jackie Cooper’s career is proof that success isn't dependent on having a university degree. After opting out of education, she didn’t dive straight into a leadership position. Instead, she enjoyed life by having many different adventures. It was these experiences that shaped her into becoming the ideal fit for her current position. The lesson to be learned here is that success and creativity can emerge from the most unexpected places. The key message in this book: Social media is upping our stress levels, and higher education is not always the answer when it comes to fostering creativity. The world we live in operates at an exceedingly fast rate, so give your brain the respite it needs to reconnect with your creative side.  Actionable Advice Read a book before you go to sleep. Next time you’re in bed, turn off your electronic devices and reach for a book. This will allow your brain to relax before you close your eyes. As you sleep, your mind will be in a better state to restore itself, which will have positive effects on your creative process. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Simpson","summary":"In today’s always changing business environment, it is crucial that employees continue to learn and develop a wide variety of skills.  And yet, this is easier said than done. As a business leader, you may have the desire to learn and inspire your team to do the same, but actually making this happen isn’t straightforward.  Help is here for you! A great coach can create a transformative experience for you and your team in a surprisingly short period of time. In essence, a coach can turn average into exceptional! How do you harness the power of a great coach to take your team to the next level? These blinks will teach you the tips and tricks of top coaches so you can realize your business goals today.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why the best feedback a coach can give doesn’t come from a coach at all; why professional and personal missions need to be in sync; and how “going with the flow” will make you more productive. If you’re a business leader, it’s your job to maximize the potential of your team. But how do you go about it?  The answer lies in coaching.  Coaching is a unique style of leadership. It’s not just concerned with consulting and advising, but instead is about unlocking the potential of another human being.  Yep, quite a hefty task! Before you consider coaching for your team, it’s important that you keep the four foundational principles of coaching in mind.  Let’s start with the first two.  A coach can’t succeed unless his team trusts him. As the first principle of coaching, trust is vital because it facilitates good communication. Two people that share trust are more likely to be open and honest with each other. Secrets or lies don’t pose a threat to their bond.  For coaches this is important, as a coach needs to know exactly what makes his team tick. A coach requires total honesty from his clients. But he won’t get it unless he presents himself honestly – trust is of course a two-way street!  The second key principle of coaching is about potential. What does this mean? Coaching is based on the assumption that each person has the potential to grow and become something better.  Unlocking someone’s potential begins with close observation. Listen carefully to what the person is saying, and the way she is saying it. Is she speaking too softly? Or avoiding eye contact? Maybe she’s just keeping her head down, or is she perhaps quick to anger?  Each of these aspects allows a coach to discover the paradigms, or views of the client, what she thinks about the world and herself, which can affect (often negatively) the way she acts and behaves.  For example, the paradigm of a person who exhibits low self-esteem might be that she lacks crucial life skills and so can’t ever achieve anything worthwhile. The job of a coach is mine for this information which can then be challenged, to show the client her true potential. With a good grasp of trust and potential, we can move to the next two principles of coaching. These are commitment and execution.  Let’s start by unpacking commitment. Why is it important?  A person’s motivation to achieve long-term goals stays strong only when she has a firm internal commitment to those goals. One way to create lasting internal commitment is to ask powerful coaching questions, and listen actively.  Consider these questions for your clients. What are the most important strategies and goals you need to accomplish, personally and professionally? Do you want to make a difference in the world? Are you looking to improve your professional skills, every day? When people become aware of their own goals and importantly, why they want to achieve these goals, their purpose becomes tangible and their will to commit becomes stronger.  Once commitment has been established, it’s time for the fourth and final principle: execution. How do coaches approach this crucial step?  Remember: the job of a coach is not to push or pull a client toward fulfillment. Instead, a coach’s job is to ensure that the client can get where she wants to go herself. The best way to ensure this is for the coach to help the client learn to work in the flow state.  A flow state is when you feel totally absorbed with a task and completely focused, with your mind, body and soul. In the flow state, you get the most done and you move naturally toward your end goal.  Athletes often achieve a flow state before and during an event, which allows them to free themselves of distractions and finish as strongly as they can. Now that you know the four principles of great coaching, let’s take a closer look at the skills involved in coaching. How do coaches put these four elements – trust, potential, commitment and execution – into action? Read on to find out. It’s important for a coach to approach building trust correctly. This is not easy! Coaches need to keep a few things in mind when developing trust with a client. A trustworthy coach is also a credible person. As a coach, you need to develop both character and competence. Character refers to personal integrity, in terms of qualities such as honesty and modesty. Competence, on the other hand, refers to your skills and capabilities.  Good coaches demonstrate strong character and competence side by side. Let’s say you’re an honest person, yet a terrible manager. If you’re always late and perpetually forgetful, do you think your team will trust you? Of course not. True credibility stems from a harmonious balance of character and competence.  Like developing trust, unlocking a client’s potential also requires a considered approach. It begins with challenging paradigms that are inaccurate and that limit a client’s performance. But how much do personal thoughts really influence performance? Think about it. If someone tells you you’re under-performing compared to your coworkers, how you think about this will become a source of pressure. You may become stressed, and this will affect how you perform in the future.  Coaches must constantly challenge a client’s negative thoughts. Granted, this doesn’t mean that you should be especially tough on a client with low self-esteem, as that’s defeating the purpose! It all comes down to asking the right questions. Great coaches know how to ask questions that increase a client’s self-awareness, so the client can discover the opportunities to create change. One paradigm-challenging question might be: “You seem to be assuming that such-and-such is the case. Why exactly is this the case?” Coaches help clients reflect on their own assumptions, where these assumptions come from and importantly, whether they are reasonable.  Once this is achieved, a follow-up question would be: “What are the alternatives to doing this?” This may start a discussion to help the client to develop new, sustainable approaches. In general, it can be hard to know in which direction you want to head professionally, as long-term goals sometimes can seem vague or unrealistic at best.  As a coach, the task of guiding others to achieve their own tentative aspirations is certainly challenging. Yet great coaches get the job done. How do they do this? Coaches help you clarify your personal and professional missions, and outline strategies for achieving them. With no clear mission to guide you, you can end up clutching at notions that seem attractive yet elusive, such as fame or money. A coach is there to remind you that this time should be spent discovering and defining your own personal and professional missions.  Moreover, it’s vital to consider personal and professional goals simultaneously. Focusing on just one creates issues later on. For example, focusing on professional goals by working tons of hours or taking on extra responsibilities may clash with personal goals of spending more time with family. To help a client find a better work-life balance, a coach needs to help the client outline both professional and personal missions in harmony. Of course, it’s one thing to help a client define goals; achieving them is another feat altogether.  Research conducted by consultants Michael Mankins and Richard Steele revealed that, on average, company strategies only provide 63 percent of the financial performance promised.  If missions and strategic goals are not followed through, they fade into mere hopes and dreams. So how do great coaches keep goals a reality? They start by helping a client identify urgent, day-to-day activities and long-term strategic goals. People spend too much time in the “whirlwind” of everyday demands. A coach should help a client learn the discipline to keep long-term strategies in mind, to achieve those goals sooner.  If you want to improve your career path and your life’s path, you’ll need some sort of regular feedback from others.  Coaches are, of course, no different. If a coach wants to really help a client, he’ll have to offer lots of feedback along the way. Yet negative or poorly formulated feedback is discouraging and is something every coach should avoid.  So how can a coach formulate feedback to make it relevant, worthwhile and actionable?  A great coach asks people to give themselves feedback first! Ask, for example: What do you like about the action you have just taken? Only after the client evaluates her own actions, should a coach offer his factual observations and suggestions.  Why do it this way? It is more likely that people will take ownership of feedback if they speak it themselves. The adage is true: “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.” Honest and helpful feedback, combined with coaching, can lead to effective change, but it is the coach’s task to prepare the client to receive it. All too often people have negative associations with receiving feedback.  Therefore, focus on the positive and play to people's strengths. Consider the following questions: What areas do you see as your greatest strengths? How do you think you can focus on them? This creates a safe zone to explore the client’s potential. Being able to approach the feedback process openly and positively energizes both coaches and clients. Do you know where your talents lie? Most of us have a general idea about what we’re good at. But did you know there are many areas in which our skills are unknown and untapped?  Great coaches seek to unleash and leverage people’s innate talents. Through conversations, coaches are able to inspire behaviors and attitudes needed to bring these talents and strengths to light.  These conversations center on performance progress, as a coach can map out clear measures to define what counts as success and what doesn’t. During an improvement conversation, a coach must be honest and direct about goals, while keeping feedback encouraging and constructive.  At the end, however, the coach steps aside, clearing the path for a client to do the job she was hired to do and thereby avoiding the negative effects of micromanagement.  In his book My Way or The Highway, author Harry Chambers found that 62 percent of employees have considered changing jobs because of micromanagement; while 32 percent actually quit. Great coaches also focus on well-performing individuals stuck in the “middle.” These people are capable of achieving greatness but seldom get the attention they need to blossom.   In their book Winning: The Answers, Jack and Suzy Welch say that every company has a low-performing group (10 to 20 percent of employees), a middle-performing group (60 to 70 percent) and a high-performing group (10 to 20 percent).  Organizations benefit from fostering this middle-performing group, as it makes up a majority of employees. Think about it! By helping this group work more effectively, you’ll be making huge strides toward company productivity.  This is just one of the many ways in which coaching can have a far-reaching impact!  The key message in this book: Coaching is about tapping into a person’s innate potential and achieving goals. From trust to potential to commitment and finally execution, coaching succeeds when these principles are well-defined. Great coaches use their skills to challenge the status quo, helping a client approach goals with clarity and setting up a framework for a client to succeed on her own steam.

Ducker","summary":"Being a business owner is a pretty demanding job: there is a team of staff to run, costs to keep an eye on, business strategy to decide and investors to meet. Finding time for it all is not easy, and even if this time is found, summoning up the energy to complete each task is just as difficult. Luckily, the modern, technologically advanced world has provided a solution: Virtual Assistants. These are members of staff who work for you but are located elsewhere – in another city, state or even country. If you hire a team of effective Virtual Assistants you will find yourself with the time to plan and lead your business. But if you get the hiring wrong, you could find yourself with even more work to do. These blinks show you how best to recruit, train and manage a team of Virtual Assistants. In these blinks you’ll discover the best way of training someone in another time zone; why you should hire Virtual Assistants for the role but not the task; and the one job you simply cannot outsource. Life as a business owner in our modern world is not easy. Often, we’re expected to be jacks of all trades, doing a myriad of jobs, each of which is time-consuming. Before you can even think about spending some time creating innovative new products and services, or even selling those products and services, you have to first grind through a schedule packed full of other stuff: there’s staff to be managed, checks to write, budgets to review, contracts with suppliers to go through, and the list goes on and on. It’s no surprise that so many struggle! In fact, the author’s own attempts to manage his business led him to a complete burnout; he simply didn’t have any time or energy left to succeed. That’s when he decided to do things a bit differently: he outsourced some of his work to Virtual Assistants (VAs). VAs are staff who do work for you, but who are not in the same location as you. They can take on a huge range of tasks, from accounting to office management, thus allowing business owners and leaders to concentrate on the work that they’re best at and that matters most. By hiring VAs, they can enjoy what is known as virtual freedom. There are two main reasons why VAs present such a great opportunity: First, the internet allows constant communication across thousands of miles between you and your VA. No matter how far apart you are, you can work as if you’re in the same room. Second, there’s a huge pool of available talent. More than 42 million Americans currently work as self-employed consultants and freelancers – all of them are potentially available for part-time, full-time or even project-based work. So, if you’re struggling to keep afloat in a sea of tasks, virtual freedom may be your life raft. Just as business leaders can’t do everything themselves – no matter how hard they try – neither can VAs. Simply put, you can’t ask a single VA to do all of your outsourced work. While it’s tempting to find one superhero VA to dump all of your work onto, the unfortunate truth is that we’re all human, even your VAs. While one VA might be able to do one or two tasks better than you, they won’t be able to tackle all of the work that you need to pass on. Bearing this in mind, you should instead hire virtual staff for specific roles. For example, you might hire a General Virtual Assistant (GVA) to manage the admin for your business. Your GVA is the one who excels at doing the little repetitive tasks, such as buying stationary for the office, organizing meetings or sending out memos. Keep in mind, however, that there is one thing that you should never outsource – your content, i.e., what you sell to your customers. Good content can be anything. If you run a business advice website, your content might be a free e-book detailing how your customers can build a blog to grow their business. Or you run a wine review blog, where your content might be videos in which you provide insights and advice for wine buyers. Your content is what makes your business successful. Indeed, a great business is not the one that spends the most on marketing, or the one that makes it to the top of Google’s search rankings. Rather, it’s the one with the most engaging and relevant content for its customers. So make sure that you provide the content yourself. This way, you can ensure that it is of the caliber that your customers expect. Luckily, since you’ve given your less important tasks to your VAs, you can devote loads of time for content creation! Working with VAs may seem easy – obviously all you have to do is search for and hire the right people, right? Well, there’s more to it than that. In fact, you’re likely to make many mistakes on the path to the perfect VAs. The author himself had to learn a few tough lessons through trial and error. For example, in the beginning he found it difficult to judge how much authority and independence to give his VAs. Some of them he gave too much, and they ended up working against his wishes. Others he gave too little to be able to do their jobs. All this trial and error resulted in some powerful heuristics that you can use when finding your VAs. First, never sacrifice quality for cost. Good VAs aren’t cheap, especially for a start-up. An app developer, for example, costs up to $2,500 per month, and a GVA $900. Although it may seem prudent to hire the least expensive VAs, it’s actually quite reckless. Remember: these people are like your in-house employees, and you want the best work from them. In the real world, you wouldn’t hire a cheap office manager with no administration experience, so why do it in the virtual one? The same consideration applies to location. Overseas VAs will most likely be cheaper, and they can perform just as well as VAs from your home country. However, working in different time zones and dealing with cultural differences can become a burden. Imagine how frustrating it would be to have to wait for six hours every day to get a reply from the person in charge of the videos for your website if you needed an instant decision on when to upload a hot viral video. You may end up losing out because of the wait. It’s your call, but think about whether the reduction in price for foreign work is worth the added hassle of working across time zones. Even though you may never see your VAs face-to-face, they’re still people. Thus, a lot of the things that hold true for hiring “normal” employees also hold true for recruiting VAs. The main thing to keep in mind when you’re hiring VAs, as with normal employees, is that you have to hire for the role, not the task. Imagine that you need a VA to edit videos for your website. Before you go and find the very best video editor, think first about what else you may want from your digital video VA in the future. For example, you may need them to upload the videos, or even shoot them. In other words, don’t just focus on their immediate task (digital editing). Think “big picture.” And although you don’t have to understand everything your video editor does, you do need at least a basic understanding to be able to make a good hiring decision. But hiring is a task, like any other, right? Couldn’t you just outsource this to another VA? No. You are in charge of developing your company, so you have to be in charge of recruitment. So be sure to research the roles you’re hiring and learn for yourself. Furthermore, all good hires start with a good job description. You need to be very clear – both for yourself and for your job candidates – about what you want from your VA. The better the job description, the easier it’ll be to find the right person to fulfill it. A good job description is clear, precise and easily understandable. Use bullet points and be very clear about what you want from your VA, and what experience is required for the job. Make sure that job interviews are personal. Always use something like Skype or Google Hangouts, and never rely on email. Only with the help of planned and high quality interviews will a good job description turn into a good hire. But hiring is just the first step... No business leader can expect their new in-house hires to know exactly what to do without some sort of guidance. They need training, and the same holds true for your VAs. There are three things that you should remember when hiring VAs. First, as mentioned previously, you have to carefully define the role you are hiring for. If, for example, you’re hiring a GVA to manage your office admin, then you’ll need to take the time to tell them exactly what is required of them. Don’t make them intuit anything. Secondly, your VAs can and should ask for help whenever they have questions, especially at the beginning. Do not allow your GVA to learn through trial and error! Make it clear that you expect them to ask when they need guidance, so that they get it right first time. Finally, be aware of time zones. Training for someone living 12 hours away from you has to be well planned in order to be well executed. While you may find the best qualified GVA overseas, you don’t want to be answering questions at 2 a.m. These three tenets are good places to start, but it will take more than that to train your VAs well. Be sure to mix up the types of media you use when training your VA, including online, audio, visual and traditional written training materials. Training can take a lot of time and attention, so developing solid training materials will save you work in the end. Once you’ve produced the best training resources, you can use them every time you hire a new VA. Be aware of cultural differences when hiring overseas. For example, if you write your emails to your Filipino VAs in ALL CAPS, then they might interpret this as shouting, and will thus feel personally offended. This in turn leads to decreased productivity and resentment. After the training is complete, you’re that much closer to finally achieving virtual freedom. But this freedom will only come if your VAs are able to work in an organized way. In other words, you need a management system. The best management systems revolve around FAQ sheets, or IFTTT cheat sheets – the acronym stands for “if that happens, then this has to happen.” You can think of IFTTT cheat sheets as emergency evacuation procedures: in case of an earthquake or fire, you simply follow the procedure to get to safety. IFTTT cheat sheets help your VAs understand what to do if, for example, your system crashes or they miss a deadline. With an IFTTT, they have clear orders about what to do next. Additionally, they prevent you from having to micromanage your VAs. Virtual assistants are supposed to free up your time, so you don’t want to spend all day checking up on their work. What’s more, this smothering, hands-on approach will demotivate your VAs. However, once your team of VAs starts to grow, then FAQ sheets simply won’t be enough. In this case, you’ll need a complete management system to keep track of what everyone is doing. While management systems sound quite scary and complicated, they really don’t have to be. Simply having a Dropbox folder or a Google Drive document where all the VAs fill in their progress on their tasks ought to be enough to keep track of everything. Management systems are especially important for new hires. You’ll want to track their progress in the beginning, and management systems allow you to do just that. For instance, you can ask your new VAs to send you an email after every workday detailing what they’ve done. Not only does this keep up the communication flow, it also helps you to decide if this particular VA is right for you and your company. Once this has been established, then you can cut down the reports. As you’ve learned, your VAs are regular people. VAs, just like your regular employees, like being part of a team. Consequently, it’s important that you make sure that your VAs truly feel like they belong. A good place to start is with fair pay. Pay them what they are worth according to their experience and above market value. Be sure to also take market conditions and location into account, as the going rate in certain countries is considerably less than in others where average incomes are higher. And always pay on time, especially with your overseas VAs, many of whom are the sole providers for large families, whose well-being depends on their timely income. Be creative with bonuses and benefits. You don’t have to entice with high salaries; sometimes things like health insurance will also do the trick. And always pay extra for work on holidays. But good pay and benefits aren’t enough. If you want your VAs to become a true team, then you’ll have to involve them in your business. Be sure to meet with all of your VAs regularly, at least via Skype, and give them the feeling that they’re part of your larger vision. Give them regular evaluations, and ensure that they’re getting feedback on their work. They want to know when they’ve done well and what they can do to become better, just like you. Once your team is large enough, you may find that you’re spending all your time managing your VAs and none of your time doing the things that you wanted to make time for in the first place. When this happens, you may need to outsource the actual management of your VA team. At this point, it’s time to consider hiring a Virtual Project Manager to oversee your VAs so that you can spend your time focusing on delivering high quality content and innovations to your valued customers. The key message in this book: Virtual assistants give you the opportunity to hand over the routine work and focus on what you really love about being a business leader: creativity and innovation. But be careful! Simply hiring VAs won’t cure all your problems; you’ll need to be smart about it. Actionable advice: Figure out what’s hogging your time. The next time you get a chance, make a list of all the specific tasks that you have to do and which distract you from the “real” work.

Effort, reward. Effort, reward. And the greater the effort, the greater the compensation. Simple. For companies that wish to give their salesforce a boost, however, it’s not quite so straightforward. These blinks will show you there’s more to sales compensation than simply rewarding results with money. Your sales compensation plan should be finely calibrated to suit different types of selling and sellers and always align with the company’s overall strategy. In these blinks you’ll learn what you should think about when you’re selling a copying machine; why you should always start by defining your success metrics; and why new sales compensation plans must be introduced slowly. Sales compensation seems simple, right? If a sales representative makes a sale, they get compensated. But it’s actually a lot more complex, and if a company implements a successful sales compensation strategy, it can be extremely profitable. It’s important to recognize that sales compensation is one part of the company’s strategy. It needs to align with the rest of it. Every company needs a solid plan for becoming profitable. These plans are always very complicated, however. They require CEOs and management teams to make difficult decisions in several areas, like sales strategy, customer coverage and enablement. The sales compensation strategy comes at the enablement level, so the CEO has to make a number of strategic decisions before they can focus on it. It’s very important that these decisions all fit perfectly with each other. If they don’t, the plan will contradict itself and be ineffective. Imagine a company that produces copying machines, for instance. The upper management knows their customers are primarily large corporations, so they develop a sales strategy based around sophisticated technology that’s suited to them. However, the company will suffer if the team doesn’t allow for the fact that they’ll need a lot of time to correspond with customer companies. If their products are expensive, their customers need more time to decide if they’re a worthy investment. Sales reps don’t aim to implement any specific company strategy; they’re motivated by their compensation rates. So your sales compensation plan has to skillfully connect their work to the company’s strategy at large. Imagine a sales rep working for a copying company that just released a new product. Even if the new product’s digital technology requires a longer, more sophisticated sales process, they’ll probably use the same tactics they used to sell the analogue one. The key to solve this problem is to craft a sales compensation plan that motivates them to do what’s best for the company, not for them. Fostering an effective sales compensation plan isn’t just about throwing money at your sales reps. It’s certainly important to reward good sellers, but first you have to determine what kind of selling you’re doing and make sure you have the right sellers for the job. You can use three kinds of selling: First, there’s retention selling – retaining the revenue you get from your current customers. In retention selling, you aim to keep a steady flow of revenue by selling the same products to the same customers again and again. Next, there’s penetration selling. Penetration selling means selling new products to customers you already have, or old products to new customers. Finally, we have new customer selling. New customer selling means either stealing your competitors’ customers, or selling newly developed products to new customers. Naturally, these different sales roles require different skills. You need to find people suited to retention, penetration and new customer selling. Reps who work in retention selling, for instance, need to intimately know their customers’ needs. It’s a good job for sellers who like hard work and dedication to long-term goals. Penetration selling also requires a strong relationship with the customer, but these sellers also need to develop that relationship so they can get more out of it. This is a job for people who have a strong drive to hit their numbers. Independent and more aggressive sellers are best suited to new customer selling. They have to be ready to take risks and push for their goals, so it’s a good job for people who are confident, outgoing and strong willed. As you might’ve guessed, the three kinds of selling are different in other ways too. They also necessitate different kinds of compensation rates to incentivize the sellers into behaving the right way. A sales rep’s income isn’t fixed. Instead, it’s determined by their target total compensation: the sum of their base salary and their target incentive. The ratio between these two figures is called a pay mix. So if the pay mix is 50/50 and the target total compensation is $100,000, the sales rep gets $50,000 at the end of the year and another $50,000 if they meet their quota. For sales roles that require more aggressive behavior, you’ll want a bigger portion of the target incentive in the pay mix. That’ll help sustain the aggressive sales approach, as the sellers know they’ll have a higher income if they make more sales. Sales reps that need to build a good relationship with their customers should have less target incentive, however. They shouldn’t be pushed into taking unnecessary risks or they might scare off their customers. You also need to reward your most successful sellers, of course. What if a rep exceeds their company’s expectations and goes beyond their quota? A smart company motivates their sellers by offering them upside potential. If you don’t, your overachievers might lose their drive or look for a new employer who values their skills more than you do. Naturally, you should avoid overpaying sales reps that lag behind. After all, it’s only fair that the sellers who contribute the most to the company earn a larger share of the pie. So, reps need to be incentivized to perform well, but what does that actually mean? It can be quite difficult to define what “good performance” really is. First, you have to define your success metrics. Don’t forget that your sales strategy needs to align with the company’s overall strategy. For example, imagine you’re a brewer and your strategy is to put as many beer cans as possible directly into the hands of the end consumers. If that’s the goal, it wouldn’t be good for your sales rep to just sell a large number of cans to a retailer. It’d be much better for them to ensure those cans end up in the right spot in the store, facing the customers and in a better position than your competitors’ goods. Performance measures like this have three dimensions. The actual measure, its level and frequency. For example, if the measure is to sell 1,000 beer cans, that can be measured every week, month or year. Performance can also be measured on a division or team level. These extra dimensions of measurement can have a big impact on the sales reps’ behavior. The reps might feel frustrated or helpless if they’re not assessed on an individual level because they might perform better than the rest of their team but not be rewarded for it. On the other hand, measuring the team as a whole could strengthen them and bring them together. The measure also needs to be taken frequently so it stays closely connected to the behavior it rewards. It would be unwise to measure the annual volumes sold if your reps operate on weekly or monthly sales, for instance. So “good performance” has a number of definitions, depending on the situation. But even if you figure out the perfect measurement system, a big question remains: when is good good enough? This is what you have to ask when you determine your reps’ quota – the amount of sales they’re required to make as part of their compensation plan. Quota setting is very important, but it can also be quite demotivating. We’ve seen how sellers who have higher quotas should have larger target incentives. As companies strive to grow, the sales reps’ quotas should grow as well. Raising the quotas as the company expands usually works well, as it ensures that reps are continuously striving for their best rather than resting on their previous successes. You have to be careful, however. A quota that’s too high or too low can be devastating. It can cause talented reps to go underpaid or reward lazier reps by overpaying them. A badly set quota could destroy the team. So you need a quota that’ll help you get the best out of every rep. You don’t want to crush strong reps by asking too much of them, but you also don’t want to make it too easy. You need to take your quota-setting process very seriously. If your business has serious growth potential and reps that are similarly talented, a flat quota where every rep gets the number would be beneficial. For example, if you’re just starting out and none of your reps have an existing customer base, they could all potentially grab 100 percent of the market, so you can assign them all the same quota. If your reps have different market and customer opportunities, it might be strategically smart to give them separate quotas. Market opportunity-driven and account opportunity-driven quotas are based respectively on the market and customer opportunities that are available. What’s great about them is that they make you consider all the growth possibilities you have and not just project your growth onto your reps’ previous performance. Sales compensation plans are clearly complicated. So who exactly should design them? The CEO? The sales compensation team? A good CEO knows how to delegate her power. Too much CEO-level involvement in the design and implementation of the sales compensation plan can be unhealthy. Usually the sales compensation team calls most of the shots themselves. Some CEOs will have a hard time with this. It might be difficult for them to let their sales compensation team develop the strategy on their own. They might want to control the process and know every little detail of it. This is counterproductive, however. It takes the CEO’s attention away from areas that do require more of their involvement. It can also undermine and demotivate the compensation team, leaving them feeling that the strategy is ineffective and they’re powerless to change it. Instead, it’s best if the CEO focuses on providing overall direction and meaningful evaluations as the plan progresses. The sales compensation plan still needs some level of CEO involvement, of course. This is true in all aspects of the company. The CEO might not know the specifics or mathematical details of the plan, but in the very least they need to provide input when it’s first being designed. They need to make sure it’s aligned with the company’s larger goals, and that the team understands those goals. As always, the CEO also needs to evaluate the plan as it evolves. They have to provide effective feedback so the compensation team knows they’re going in the right direction. So after you’ve got a great sales compensation plan in place, you’ll need to start working with your managers and sellers. How? How do you go about implementing your sales compensation plan? You’ll need to have some good sales managers in place. They’re an absolutely essential part of a strong sales team. Good sales managers need to be highly skilled. The team can’t thrive and enjoy success without them. They guide the reps and make sure everyone hits their quota. More importantly, they serve as a link between the executive level and the sales reps working on the front line. Sales managers also have to be on top of any changes that occur, so they can translate effectively between the departments. Good sales managers are hard to find, however. It’s very common for talented sales reps to avoid becoming managers even if they get the chance, because they know they’ll earn more by making sales. Despite this, most managers are still former top-performing sellers. They often find it hard to pass on their knowledge, however. They may be tempted to step in and take over anytime things get hard. You can recruit strong managers by offering them new kinds of opportunities and benefits. A company almost certainly can’t afford to pay their managers what they’d earn in the field, so they need to find other ways to make the job attractive to them. Think about the profile of a good sales manager. She’s a hard-working overachiever who’s looking for recognition and new challenges. So rewards instead of cash could be frequent flyer miles to reward her for her success, or long-term incentives like stock in the company. Non-financial rewards could include attractive career paths and new opportunities, maybe by offering her a reward for reaching a strategic goal for the company, or starting a new activity that benefits the team. So now you have a strong compensation plan and a good manager to back it up. What’s next? Well, even the best plan is useless if your sales reps don’t understand it. Naturally, the reps may feel uneasy with it at first. People are scared of change, especially when it affects the way they’re compensated for their work. If they’re nervous about the plan, it might just be that they’re confused by it. Remember: just because the CEO and sales compensation team understand the plan, doesn’t mean the sales reps do. Their nervousness is normal. After all, how can you expect people to work well when they’re not sure if they’ll be paid as usual? Anytime you make changes to the compensation plan, you need to implement them effectively. Make sure you always explain to the reps why the changes are necessary, and what exactly is changing. Also, be very clear about the specifics. Who will be affected by the changes? How? When exactly are the changes taking place? Reps need to know the answers to these questions. They also need to know if changes promise them a better future, and what dangers lie ahead if no change is made. Let them see that your plan can be beneficial to them, and the company isn’t just trying to make more money at their expense. Before you talk to your sales reps, try to predict how they’re going to react. Strive to avoid negativity. There will always be some people who resist change. Some people might not engage fully with the plan, while others might behave in more aggressive ways. Identify the people you think will resist the most, and take special care to convince them that the change is actually for the best. The key message in this book: Sales representatives don’t consciously implement the company’s strategy – they’re motivated by their compensation rates. So design a compensation plan that incentivizes them to help the company by putting sellers in the right roles, setting appropriate quotas and rewarding them accordingly. They’ll ensure the company’s success – and help themselves in the process. Actionable advice: Know when to stay out of it. The sales compensation strategy will almost certainly be more effective if the CEO minimizes her involvement and gives her compensation team the freedom to implement the plan themselves. So even if it’s tempting to take over – don’t. You’ll be glad you didn’t. Suggested further reading: The Challenger Sale by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson Sales strategies have changed.

How does one recruit the right person? Who is the perfect fit? It might seem like a simple undertaking, but consider this: half the recruiting companies end up hiring individuals who aren’t the right fit or don’t have the right skill sets. And the cost of those missteps is staggering. So what can be done? In these blinks, we’ll take a look at how you should think about hiring. We’ll look at the thinking that needs to be done before beginning the hiring process itself, and equip you with a battery of questions that can be used in interviews. In the end, you’ll be more than ready to find the right “who” for your business. You’ll also find out what the disadvantages of hiring a generalist are; why social skills are as important as professional skills; and the four interviews you should conduct with all potential recruits. Hiring can be a nightmare. But why all the fuss about getting the right person on the first try? If a new hire doesn’t work out, you can always just replace her, right? Well, here’s the truth: if you think hiring is a matter of trial and error, you’re probably pretty new to the grueling initiation rite that is onboarding a new employee. Furthermore, hiring errors can cost companies a fortune and they happen far more often than they should. Studies done by the authors have found that a typical hiring mistake will cost a company around fifteen times the employee’s monthly salary. Some of these costs stem from poor decisions made by the employee; the rest, from the work necessary to fire and replace him. To put this in perspective, imagine you hire a manager who earns $100,000 a month. If your decision turns out to be a bad one, you’ll have cost the company up to $1.5 million! Clearly, hiring the wrong person is an expensive mistake. Yet it happens all the time. According to management guru Peter Drucker, most managers make at least 50 percent of their mistakes during hiring decisions. This makes sense, though. Business people often lack the skills they need to make sound hiring choices. So they end up relying not on personal expertise, but gut instinct. This approach can be likened to that of an amateur art critic whose repertoire of responses to a work of art is limited to “I like it” and “I don’t like it.” The problem is that art can easily be forged and first impressions are often weak guides. Like the rash and uninformed critic, people who hire based on instinct can be fooled by charismatic candidates with little true ability. Or, in other instances, managers act like prosecutors, trying to trick candidates into slipping up. As you’ll learn, doing this will only put a prospective hire on the defensive, preventing you from finding out whether he has the right skills for the job. Luckily, there’s a better approach, and in the next blinks you’ll learn all about it. Would you consider hiring an unlicensed contractor to remodel your kitchen? Probably not. After all, there’s no way to know whether she has the skills necessary to complete the job. By the same token, you shouldn’t hire people without knowing precisely what qualifications they need to succeed. To do that, you must define your hiring needs. Recruiters often forget to define exactly what it is they're looking for – a lapse that can derail the entire hiring process. Indeed, it’s crucial to know exactly what you want right from the get-go. One of the authors recently worked for a major financial services firm that needed to hire a VP of strategy and planning. The author started the process by asking the management team what the new VP’s role would be. His question sparked a heated discussion. One manager argued they needed someone who could craft a master plan for their budget, while another said they needed someone with a vision for new strategies and products. It was immediately clear that the team didn’t agree about what they were looking for, which is precisely what you want to avoid. After all, if you’re not sure who you want to hire, you’ll end up with a generalist, rather than someone with specialized skills. In fact, hiring an all-round candidate is one of the most common mistakes in hiring. People tend to be impressed by the generalized abilities of such people, forgetting, meanwhile, to ask about essential and specific skills. Just imagine you have a backlog in your business operations. You need someone who can tighten up your operations and prune the old work. In interviews, you speak with a capable, innovative and charismatic business developer. Even though she’d be a stellar candidate in a different context, she’s not right for the job at hand. Why? Well, while she might generate more business for the company, this is exactly what you don’t want; more business will increase your backlog, thereby creating greater operational delays and increased customer complaints. Intellect and smarts alone won’t make an employee great. She needs to have social skills, too, something recruiters would do well to keep in mind. But to truly ensure that new hires fit in, you also need to know what the culture of your company is. In fact, one-third of the CEOs that the authors interviewed while preparing this book admitted that they’d made massive hiring mistakes by writing off the importance of a cultural fit. To avoid making this mistake yourself, define your company culture from day one. Bring your leadership team together and ask them how they would describe the environment of the company. No need to get too fancy – quick, off-the-cuff definitions will do the trick. For example, one of the author’s clients came up with catchwords like “analytical, dynamic, fast and informal.” Now they know that new employees should be comfortable in an environment that matches those words. That being said, ensuring a cultural fit might mean saying no to people with serious talent. Just remember: a prospective hire might be incredible at her job, but not share your company’s values and, in the end, your company culture is more important. For example, the NPO Institute for Sustainable Communities recruited a new employee for an essential role in an African country, where the institute was battling AIDS. The new hire did a great job, managing to transform the opinion of both the country’s president and parliament, who had previously been dismissive of the AIDS crisis, calling it a matter of immorality. However, the new employee wasn’t a team player. He was brilliant, but also arrogant and often made those he worked with feel inferior. His work-style had a negative impact on the overall performance of the team and, in the end, the CEO had to let him go. Plenty of billion-dollar firms consider hiring to be one of their most important business operations. But despite this fact, for most companies, it’s not a continuous process. That’s because traditional hiring methods only look for new employees when they’re needed, which is a major error. After all, with the clock ticking, the hiring team is under intense pressure to find someone – and fast. This makes it more likely that they’ll hire the wrong person. Not just that, but generally when a manager knows there will be a vacancy, she contacts the HR team and asks them to find some potential candidates. As a result, the company ends up having to choose among the available job hunters instead of selecting the absolute best candidates. So what’s a better method? It’s best to get referrals from your networks, both business and private. In fact, herein lies the golden rule of hiring. Seventy-seven percent of the CEOs interviewed by the authors said that using their own network was hands down the best way to make successful hires for their company. But the key is to always be searching for these people, not just seeking them out when you know you need them. For instance, the CEO of Aon Corporation, a leading insurance firm, says his success isn’t a result of being smarter than the competition. Rather, it’s a product of devoting a tremendous amount of his time to finding new talent for his company. He has a goal of finding 30 new potential hires every year and his main managers have the same target. As a result, the company always has a substantial pool of stellar candidates whenever a specific position opens up. So building a roster of potential candidates is key. But even with such a pool, you need to be able to choose the right person for the job. In the next blink, you’ll learn how to do just that. When sussing out candidates, interviews are crucial – and knowing how to structure them is even more important. That’s why, to ensure that your hiring decisions hit the mark, you should use a four-interview system. Each of these interviews will build on the others, increasing in precision as the process advances. Implementing this system will require effort and dedication, but it will be worth it in the end, as you’ll be much more likely to find the perfect match for the specific role you’re filling. Such a comprehensive approach is important. After all, this isn’t an audition for a part in a movie; you can’t make a decision based on seeming ability and appearance. You’ll need a long list of facts about a person’s professional life – a life that may span decades. So make a point of conducting four basic interviews: the screening interview, the who interview, the focused interview and the reference interview. The first of these, the screening interview, is an initial test to filter out candidates who are clearly not right for the job. This interview should be conducted by phone and last no longer than thirty minutes. There are four essential questions to answer here: What are the candidate’s professional goals? What are his professional strengths? His weaknesses? And, finally, how does he think his former bosses would rate his performance? The answers to these questions will give you a rapid-fire overview of the candidate’s profile and past performance. But don’t go too deep. Remember: the goal is to screen and eliminate. In other words, as soon as it becomes clear that someone isn’t a fit, you should begin winding the interview down. Next up, you’ll learn about the other three interviews that complete this process. The screening interview will narrow the field, but you’ll have a way to go before you select your ideal candidate. The next step is to unearth relevant facts about these promising candidates and the who interview is your tool to do so. This second interview is more in-depth, the goal being to find out who the candidate really is. It’s based on a method pioneered by Brad Smart, the father of one of the authors. Here’s how he came up with it: As a young management psychologist, Brad was asked to sit in on management recruiting interviews involving senior partners. When the partner finished asking questions, Brad was allowed to ask a few more. In these interviews, he went deep, asking about every single detail of the candidate’s career – all her successes and all her failures. The senior partner was impressed by this approach and, since then, such in-depth interviews have proven to be a successful practice. Typically, these who interviews involve questions related to the tasks required by prior roles, what went well during them and what could have gone better, as well as relationships with bosses and colleagues. If done correctly, at the end of the who interview, you’ll have a full picture that lets you select promising candidates from the broader pool. Once you’ve made these selections, it’s time to ensure that the candidates actually fit precisely what you’re looking for, which is where the last two interviews come in. First, in the focused interview, you should go through the specific tasks the job entails. For instance, if the role of the position is to increase sales, you’ll want to reevaluate the candidate’s skill set around bringing in new customers. This is also an opportunity to ask any follow-up questions after you look at your notes from the who interview. And, finally, the last step is the references interview, where you check the candidate's references by asking precise questions. Doing so will help you uncover the whole truth and set you up to make an intelligent decision. At the end of this process you should be ready to make an offer. But what if the candidate doesn’t want the job? You’ll learn how to tackle that in the next blink. Imagine how frustrating it would be to conduct four interviews with a perfect candidate, only for him to walk out the door. It would be a huge letdown, but you can make sure it doesn’t happen by selling the candidate on the job. That means convincing him that the job fits both his skills and personality. After all, employees want to be set up for success and the better a job fits their skills and style, the more likely they are to flourish. Just take Mark Stone of the private equity firm Gores Group. He says that if you’re as concerned about a job fitting a candidate’s needs as you are about him fitting the job, convincing him will be a piece of cake. Shockingly, taking this step is exceedingly rare. Ninety-nine percent of recruiters only endeavor to learn whether the candidate is equipped for the job, utterly failing to consider the potential hire’s perspective. In short, making sure the role is right for the candidate is as important as figuring out whether the candidate is right for the role. But it’s also important for a new hire to feel included in the company culture, which means you’ll also need to sell him on the environment. To do so, tell him about the company, its vision and its goals. Discuss the way people behave in the company. Is it inclusive and familial or competitive and fast-paced? Make sure the candidate understands that you chose him because he fits in. Make him feel welcome! And, finally, selling a job also means making sure it fits with the candidate’s family life. That doesn’t just mean having flexible timetables, but also making families a part of the company culture. For example, Gabriel Echavarría owns a ceramics company in Colombia, and he puts a tremendous emphasis on meeting the families of every new employee. The families are taken on a guided tour of the company site, introduced to employees and invited to parties. The whole goal is to make them feel at home in the company. Management experts and CEOs agree that bringing on talented employees is the single most important facet of building a successful company. But to make hiring all-star candidates a part of your company culture, you’ll have to lay out a clear process. First, you need to make clear to your management team that people are your top priority. This is essential. Indeed, successful managers interviewed by the authors said that they spend up to 60 percent of their time thinking about their current and future employees. From there, your job is to improve hiring methods. To get your team on board with this, you need to do more than just mention hiring at meetings. Rather, you need to have discussions about the idea, convincing your managers why hiring is important. During these discussions, you can bring in materials on the subject and circulate them throughout your firm. You might even hold workshops to train your team to network and keep an eye out for talent. That being said, be sure your hiring techniques remain within the law. Getting creative during the hiring process is great but there are a few legal restrictions you need to respect. For instance, you need to stick with relevant criteria when evaluating candidates, whether positively or negatively. If you reject somebody, do it because of the facts, not your personal feelings. Beyond that, you must have some type of standardized hiring procedure so that all candidates receive equal treatment. Be sure that there are no disparities in regards to demographics. Finally, you should be aware that it’s illegal to ask a candidate certain questions. For example, you can’t ask a prospective hire if she’s married, whether she intends to have kids, what her sexual orientation is or when and where she was born. With these few precautionary facts in mind, you’re ready to build a talent pool for your company to source from. Get started today and you can put your firm on the path to the incredible success that only comes from having the best people on board. The key message in this book: Hiring is often treated as a last-minute necessity – an approach that brings poor results. To make sure that your company has the talent it needs to succeed, you should instead make hiring a top priority. Treat this process as a constant effort and never stop building your pool of potential hires.  Actionable advice: Be persistent and offer concessions.  Hiring is hard work and you don’t want it all to be for nothing. So, once you find the right person for a job, you shouldn’t take his first no as a definitive answer. Instead, find out what he needs in order to say yes and compromise if you have to. Don’t risk losing out on top talent because you didn’t do everything you could. Got feedback?

It could simply be to earn money to pay bills and buy groceries, it might be a way to maintain social interactions or perhaps it’s something that we feel deeply engaged in. Well, chances are it’s a mix of all these factors and more – so how do you create a workplace that fulfills all of these needs? Work today has become badly imbalanced, tilted toward money as the main, and sometimes only, incentive to perform. For some, money might indeed be the most important incentive, but for others it can actually be demotivating; the end result is that we become less effective and less creative.  Read on to take a closer look at the psychology of why we work and the ways we can make our everyday employment feel more important and fulfilling.  In these blinks, you’ll find out how monetary incentives for parents to pick up their kids early had the opposite effect; how the dangers of vicious work cycles are best avoided; and why Adam Smith’s ideas about incentivizing efficiency are wrong. Do you know what your work means to you? Whether you know exactly how and why your work matters, or have never really thought about it, your answer is a key indicator of your experience of work.  People tend to see work from three different standpoints. For some of us, work might be nothing more than a job. We do it to pay the bills, buy groceries and have some spending money. Work is necessary, but going beyond a job’s required tasks is pushing it.  Others perceive their work as a career; in other words, a period that is hopefully characterized by progress and growth. Career-minded people work for promotions, raises and increased responsibilities. They certainly expect more fulfillment from their positions than those for whom work is merely a job.  Still others believe their work to be a calling. For these people, the work they do creates positive change in the world. Their work becomes not only a vital part of life, but a source of happiness too.  You probably know people that fit into each of these categories. Perhaps you’ve found yourself in all three of them at different stages in your life. But why do these differing attitudes exist in the first place? Well, that’s a question that one American psychologist was determined to answer. Amy Wrzesniewski and her team conducted interviews and studies with individuals across different fields and industries in order to find out what made their work a calling and not just a job.  Hospital custodians cited interactions with patients as the most fulfilling aspect of their work, while administrative assistants said they felt most satisfied when supporting their faculty in providing education to tomorrow's leaders. In both cases, employees felt their work was a calling when witnessing the positive changes they made in the lives of others.  How can you make your employees feel like their work is a calling? Find out in the following blinks.  What makes a business run well? Today, there are countless formulas, strategies and mantras out there, all designed to keep companies running effectively. In reality, it’s quite simple: there are three factors that make a company come out on top, and they’re all tied to how employees are treated.  The first of these is autonomy. When given more independence and responsibility, everyone from entry-level workers to leaders in project teams will take more pride in their work. Granting employees the power to make key decisions in their field boosts levels of trust, commitment and respect within the workplace. The next factor is investment. Some of the most successful companies today have reached great heights by dedicating time, money and effort into the skill development of their employees. Through challenging training programs, employees feel that their time at work is valuable, and that their roles themselves are also valuable.  The third crucial factor is mission. A company’s mission isn’t just something that should halfheartedly come up in the CEO’s speeches. Instead, it should be continually present in the everyday affairs of the workplace, across each level of management, within every team endeavour and, of course, in the finished products.  During periods of poor performance, companies tend to reduce levels of autonomy, investment and mission to compensate. This, however, should be avoided, as it only serves to exacerbate problems by creating vicious work cycles.  Take, for example, a company facing pressure from a rival in the market. They may axe jobs or introduce strict monitoring of employee performance in an effort to lift performance. Unfortunately, the opposite will occur: Reduced job security and responsibility will make employees more demotivated than ever, leaving the company in a less competitive position. Management then responds by introducing even tighter control, employee morale shrinks again and the cycle continues.  Take a closer look at exactly why strict management leaves employees demotivated in the next blink.  Have you ever worked a job where it felt like your supervisor was breathing down your neck? Though some of us claim to work well under pressure, this is usually not the case. Treating employees as if they’re incapable of performing well alone simply won’t motivate them to perform at all.  Overstructuring is known to decrease engagement and productivity. Even so, it’s still a key characteristic of many professions and institutions today. In fact, one of the worst perpetrators of perennial overstructuring is the US education system.  Teachers in the United States are provided with incredibly detailed curricula, designed so that even bad teachers are able to provide students with an adequate education. With no room to alter lesson plans to suit the individual needs of their students or to experiment with more effective teaching styles, it’s no surprise that many teachers become unhappy with their work.  They may have gone into teaching hoping that it was their calling, but their current work feels like nothing more than a job. This doesn’t make for a positive classroom environment for students, either!  Unfortunately, overstructuring isn’t the only factor depleting employee motivation. Reliance on financial incentives is another strategy that often backfires. But what could be more motivating than a pay raise? Let’s dig deeper with a case study from an Israeli day care.  The daycare center in question had been struggling with the high number of parents picking up their kids after regular hours. So, they introduced a fine that late parents would be required to pay. Hoping that this would encourage parents to be punctual, the daycare was rudely surprised by the results.  Before the fine was introduced, a quarter of parents tended to arrive late. But after the fine, this number shot up to 40 percent. While parents had considered tardiness as poor behavior before the fine was implemented, late pick-ups simply became an option that parents could pay a little extra for.  Financial incentives seem like a good idea at first, but ultimately run the risk of turning social or moral contracts of integrity into flexible financial relations, thus missing their target entirely.  Today, the word discovery is often used interchangeably with invention. Yet the two are entirely different things.  A discovery is something that simply exists. Though we may have found it, we had no role in bringing it into existence. An invention is something humans have brought into existence, not by finding it, but by building it. In the case of inventions, humans are responsible for the decision to create something. That means considering whether the invention is helpful, necessary, harmful or useless.  Inventions aren’t just objects or products, either; they can be ideas and theories too. This is crucial to remember, as theories about human nature are mistakenly seen as discoveries all too often. This was the case with Adam Smith’s influential economic theory as presented in his book The Wealth of Nations. This famous late-eighteenth-century work had a lot of ideas about how workplaces should be configured to maximize efficiency.  One of Smith’s key arguments was that people only work if they are provided with incentives. This is an idea that workplaces around the globe today still hold on to. Think about it: the most obvious reward for hard work is more pay.  But hang on – in the previous blink, we learned that financial incentives usually backfire. So why do we still believe we or our employees will be motivated by money? Although many theories attempt to describe human nature, some of them end up dictating it instead. If nobody had ever heard of Adam Smith’s ideas, we might approach work very differently – Smith’s theory may very well have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  In the same way that we make the very mistakes our overbearing supervisors expect us to make, we’ve become motivated by money because that’s what we expect of ourselves. Should things stay this way? Nope! Find out more in the final blink. Purchasing a shirt that was manufactured using child labor is certainly a questionable decision from an ethical point of view. And while it might seem a strange thing to ask in the context, a typical economic measure would examine whether the decision to buy the shirt was efficient. Most of us aren’t sure how to answer that one, which indicates just how limited the concept of efficiency really is.  Economists today define efficiency purely in terms of profit. But if economists want to take a truly modern approach, efficiency should be measured in light of other factors, too. Output is more than how much money is generated – customer satisfaction should also be evaluated. Similarly, input shouldn’t just be the costs of physical labor, but should include the emotional labor supplied by workers as well.  This revised definition already provides a solid framework for more sustainable business endeavors. By showing interest in the psychological costs of work, employers are better positioned to create new working processes that increase employee happiness and productivity.  This all starts with asking three simple questions: what, how, and when.  What is the purpose of your employees’ tasks? What positive impacts do they create?  How do your workers complete their tasks? Are they strictly monitored, or do they call the shots?  And finally, when can you introduce change if things aren’t looking so great at your workplace?  Employers often answer the third question with avoidance. It’s true that the modern economy is in constant flux; however, waiting for stability to change your company will only allow vicious cycles to deepen. The answer to the third question is always “now”!  The key message in this book: Heavy reliance on financial incentives and strict performance monitoring leaves workers feeling demotivated and disengaged. If companies want to make their workplace positive and productive, outdated theories must be left behind. By making employees feel trusted and valued, employers can make their jobs feel like a calling. Actionable advice: Create social incentives. The next time you want to motivate your employees, don’t dangle a bonus in front of their noses. Instead, highlight the positive impact that their work has on the lives of others by getting employees in touch with customers. An automotive company, for example, might invite car owners to share their positive experiences with the employees that sold them the vehicle!

What we often forget is that behind the success of all these people are legions of employees – employees who work hard every day to make the company’s vision a reality.  If you have employees who love to come to work and are passionate about learning more and taking on more responsibility, there’s no limit to what your company can achieve. If you don’t, your company will probably sink like a stone. So how do you energize your employees and keep them motivated? Simple – just follow the 12 essential steps. In these blinks, you’ll learn why homo economicus is out and homo reciprocans is in; how Hewlett-Packard survived a recession; and what happens when you get students to build the same LEGO figure over and over again. Are you a morning person who tends to wake up energized and excited at the thought of going to work? Or do you dread hearing your alarm clock in the morning?  Either way, you’re certainly not alone. When it comes to energy levels at work, most of us fall under one of the four different types of employees.  The first group, comprising 19 percent of the US workforce, is called the demoralized group. People like this don’t like their jobs whatsoever and tend to feel that their bosses never give them positive feedback.  The second type is called the frustrated group. Accounting for 23 percent of the working population, they sometimes receive positive reinforcement from their bosses, but often have a neutral or negative opinion of their work.  Third is the encouraged group, which makes up 29 percent of all US workers. These employees see their jobs as good, but not great.  And finally, the energized group is the 29 percent of the US working population with the highest level of energy on the job. They tend to report extremely high levels of job satisfaction.  But why are so many workers unmotivated and tired on the job? It’s in part due to the widespread view of humans as homo economicus rather than homo reciprocans.  Homo economicus is believed to be rational and motivated by money. So, if you want homo economicus to do something, you simply threaten him – with dismissal, for instance – and he’ll do as he’s told. This method sees humans as cogs in a machine that can be controlled with proverbial carrots and sticks. The homo reciprocans, however, is defined by his tendency toward reciprocity. So, if you scratch his back, he’ll do the same for you – but will also reciprocate poor treatment. This style of management is more in line with true human behavior. So, when employers wonder about why their employees aren’t engaging with their work, it often has to do with the way a boss treats his workers. If you don’t treat employees like individuals, they’re bound to become frustrated.  If a manager could do one thing to make his employees happy, what would it be? Well, since employees want to be seen as individuals, it’s essential that managers meet with their employees on a regular basis and promote individuality. For instance, the Make-a-Wish foundation encourages its employees to come up with personalized titles for themselves to be used within the organization.  Some of the amazing choices include “Goddess of Greeting” and “Heralder of Happy News”. But it wasn’t just a creative exercise. Expressing their individuality actually helped employees tackle the emotional difficulties of assisting terminally ill children in satisfying their dying wishes.  So, personality is key – but plenty of companies continue to ignore the individuality of their employees. In fact, just seven out of ten employees in the United States are given the opportunity to meet regularly with their managers, which is an important factor in addressing individuals’ needs. In addition, only 21 percent of American employees agree with the statement “My manager understands me.” Beyond simply being seen as individuals, employees also require job security to ensure consistent and strong performance. Research has found that among people who are concerned about losing their jobs, 56 percent want to work elsewhere; that’s compared to just 22 percent among people who feel a high level of job security.  By way of example, in 1970, Hewlett-Packard was struggling due to a stagnating US economy. But instead of letting people go, the board of management agreed that everyone in the company, except for a few people, would be required to take off every second Friday, accepting a 10 percent pay cut in the process. A few months after their decision, the crisis was over and the company came out strong, all because they offered their employees the job security they needed to thrive. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. In the next blinks, you’ll learn about many more creative solutions for boosting employee performance! Which would you prefer: a boss who gives you the money you need to reach your goals or one who takes an interest in your personal financial ambitions, helping you reach them over time? Well, while many people would prefer a cash payout, it’s actually more beneficial for companies to invest in their employees’ long-term financial goals. In fact, money doesn’t actually incentivize employees in the long run – all it does is make them want more money.  Why? This is in part due to an effect known as hedonic adaptation, the human tendency to get used to material goods. For instance, when you first buy a new car, driving it can be an absolute thrill. But just a few months later it may not feel like anything special.  So, a better strategy than giving employees money in hand is for companies to help their workers reach their long-term financial goals, which in turn helps the company succeed and breeds loyalty. In fact, among US employees who feel that their company is helping them meet their financial goals, just four percent want to leave their jobs.  But money is useless if you can’t enjoy it, which is why companies who want thriving employees need to help them strike a healthy work-life balance. For instance, in Canada, 16 percent of employees find it difficult to balance the demands of their jobs with their private lives. This can be a dangerous situation, resulting in burnout.  Therefore, it’s imperative that companies understand that people have limits, and that performing beyond them for too long is bound to backfire. Overworked employees become exhausted and their work suffers as a result.  As such, it’s in the best interests of companies to help their employees achieve a balanced routine. For example, the software provider SAS implemented a 35-hour workweek to improve its employees’ well-being.  Anyone who went to high school knows that cool people are the most popular. The same goes for businesses: attractive companies are cool companies.  For instance, according to the author’s research, just six out of ten employees think their workplace is “cool,” which is unfortunate because people who work for companies that they consider cool are 13 times more creative than those who don’t. In addition, employees who maintain a positive view of their companies take pride in their work and recommend the company to people on the job hunt.  So, while it’s difficult to define what a cool company is, certain factors carry a lot of weight. For example, when it comes to a person, coolness has a lot to do with being yourself and not someone else. For a company, it’s similar.  Companies shouldn’t look to their peers for guidance or constantly talk about how different companies are succeeding; instead, they should be all about themselves, pointing out how they’re unique and what’s good about them.  Just consider Apple. Even though everyone has heard stories about how difficult it could be to work underneath the visionary perfectionist Steve Jobs, the company is undeniably cool.  But just as important as coolness is transparency, because maintaining transparency will help build trust with employees. For example, in 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that just 19 percent of Generation Y, referring to people born between 1980 and 1995, think other people are trustworthy.  This is a huge drop from Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980, for which the same statistic was 30 percent – and it looks even worse when compared to the 40 percent reported by Baby Boomers, born between 1950 and 1965. Luckily, these startling numbers can be reversed, and doing so will depend on companies becoming more transparent. Transparency promotes trust as employees no longer feel that their company is hiding important information from them. This might be as simple as making employee salaries public or talking about the strengths and weaknesses of upper management.  When you’re working, do you find some tasks more fulfilling and enjoyable than others? Most people do, and making all tasks more meaningful to employees is a sure-fire way to get them to work more efficiently. For instance, an experiment conducted at Harvard University found that nobody enjoys working on tasks they consider meaningless.  In the study, students were asked to build a LEGO figure in exchange for $3. Then they were asked if they would like to build a second one for $2.70, then a third for $2.40 and so on.  One group of participants were given materials to assemble a new figure each time and another used the same materials over and over after they were disassembled by researchers. Unsurprisingly, the first group built 50 percent more figures on average than the second, as they could see the varying results of their work and therefore believed it to have meaning.  If employees see their work as meaningful, they’ll be more productive. But there’s one thing to keep in mind: this strategy only works if the employer can communicate how significant the work is to her. Because if she can’t, employees might feel like they’re being manipulated into working more.  But it’s also essential for companies to take into account the expectations employees have for the future of the business. Among employees who feel the least optimism about a company’s future, 62 percent plan to quit in the next few months. On the other hand, those who are most optimistic about a firm’s future are also optimistic about their future at the company.  So, it’s crucial for companies to brighten employee expectations of what’s to come, such as by investing in employees’ personal development.  For most people, having a boss recognize your contributions is a pretty great feeling. Being acknowledged for doing a good job is a great motivator and this recognition can be used to stimulate employee success.  When a person accomplishes something, the neurotransmitter dopamine is released in their brain, producing a pleasurable sensation. But dopamine isn’t just released when you succeed – you also get a dose of the chemical when your success is recognized by others.  Humans are social creatures and approval from others demonstrates our importance within a group. However, despite the obvious importance of approval, research has found that just 25 percent of the US workforce feels that they receive positive feedback for good work.  But recognizing employee contributions doesn’t necessarily mean turning a blind eye to failures. Managers should still tell employees when they mess up, while keeping in mind that people need recognition to succeed.  It’s also essential for employees to feel like they’re part of a team, as they are more likely to focus on customers and feel a greater sense of obligation to their company. It also makes for a more positive working environment.  For instance, in the United States, 70 percent of workers say they feel a strong sense of teamwork on the job, 81 percent report being good friends with co-workers and 77 percent are of the opinion that they work with talented people.  Nonetheless, plenty of companies still focus on business results at the expense of human relationships, even though it’s not such a difficult balance to find. Building meaningful human connections could be as simple as, say, allowing flexible working spaces that enable employees to work close to the people they like.  Most parents know that giving their kids responsibilities is essential to helping them grow and feel good about themselves. Similarly, in the working world, good management is all about letting employees lead. When employees have a voice in how their work is accomplished, they tend to be more motivated. For instance, the American online retailer Zappos runs on a holacracy, a company structure that swaps a top-to-bottom power division for a broadly distributed one. As a result, Zappos is renowned for its highly engaged employees.  But this also has major implications for the role of management. For example, instead of telling employees what to do, managers become more like coaches that bring out the best in their teams. Good managers know when to give an employee more or less responsibility. So, at its core, management is becoming more about enabling employees to lead an organization.  Putting employees in extreme situations can also help them improve, since it’s only in extreme situations that people are pushed to their absolute best. Consider the crew of a US Navy submarine: they often work in extremely harsh conditions, confined to the submarine for long periods and with little personal space. They also rarely see their loved ones. Nonetheless, many of these people have very high levels of psychological resilience and can easily bounce back from mistakes or bad news. They have adapted to the extreme circumstances of their jobs and have grown as a result.  Applying this insight to the world of business means there’s something to be gained from dire situations like a high-stress project. So, the next time you’re faced with such a scenario, just keep in mind that it’s also an opportunity for personal growth! The key message in this book: Employers have more influence over their workers than they might realize. If managers start seeing employees as individuals with personal needs, they can substantially boost the energy, motivation, productivity and creativity of their workforce, thereby making their companies more profitable.  Actionable advice: Organize a company event. The psychological well-being of employees is essential to company success, since employees who are taken care of by their company will return the favor. Treating your employees right is hugely important and organizing events is an easy way to show them you care. Even a small gesture can pay off big time! Got feedback?

That’s not only because of the lure of fat stock options or because it’s been voted the best place to work so many times. It’s more than that. Working at Google somehow brings to mind the idea of personal freedom, or working at your best while being surrounded by the world’s brightest minds. How did that come to be? Google’s famous workplace culture didn’t just emerge out of thin air. It’s the work of Google’s People Operations, one of the most innovative HR departments in the world. These blinks take a look at what makes Google special from the perspective of Laszlo Bock, the head of People Operations and a champion of Google’s in-house culture. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you should pay people unfairly; how rewarding employees with cash makes them unhappy; and the best way to hire and retain the very best candidates. When you hear about working at Google, you probably think about beanbags, free food and other delightful perks. But it isn’t the fun and the freebies that really makes Google so successful; it’s a manifesto of mission, transparency and voice. Google’s mission is simple and powerful: “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” It’s a profound mission because firstly, it gives moral, rather than commercial meaning to employees’ work. That is, the information workers sift and sort through actually helps everyone who uses the search engine. Second, the mission has no ceiling. A typical mission might be to become the market leader, but once this is accomplished, it’s no longer inspiring. At Google, however, employees are constantly motivated to explore new ways of organizing information. Another key tenet of Google’s successful culture is its transparency. In a traditional software company, a new engineer only sees the code from whatever projects they’re working on. At Google, however, a newcomer can access everything from product launch initiatives to another employee’s weekly status report. Furthermore, each week the CEO updates the whole company on the past week and carves out time afterward for a 30 minute Q&A session. Thanks to this update, everyone knows who’s working on what, which ensures they don’t double up and work on it too. It also makes it clear who the go-to person is regarding a particular project. Finally, Google gives every employee a voice. It values the input of everyone and gives them a say in how the company is run. In fact, most practices within the company originated from employees. In 2009, an annual Bureaucracy Busters program was launched so employees could identify their biggest frustrations. How did Google create such a thriving culture? They employed outstanding people. Here’s how they find them. There are two ways to have an exceptional employee: hire the best or train the average. As you may already have guessed, Google does the former. According to the Corporate Executive Board, the average company pays around $600 for training and $450 for hiring. But they’re doing it all wrong. The worst case scenario after recruiting a great candidate is that they end up performing at a mediocre level. But the worst case scenario after hiring an average candidate is that they drain a considerable amount of training resources and wind up performing below average! Therefore, Google invests a great deal of time and resources in finding the right person for the job. They are incredibly scrupulous; hiring only 5,000 people a year out of one to three million applicants. That’s an admission rate of 0.25 percent. Compare that with Harvard University’s admission rate, which is a rather more lenient 6.1 percent. But what should you look for in a candidate? When Google first started out, they only hired 100 people a year and the right candidate was an Ivy League graduate. However, over time, Google learned that many of their best employees weren’t the ones who attended the most illustrious schools. Instead of hiring only those with prestigious degrees, Google started looking for candidates who showed resilience and the ability to overcome obstacles. They realized that the best approach was to hire someone who was better than you, and to seek out those who can make everyone around them more successful. The Google hiring process involves slowly and carefully sifting through only the best performers in the field. Karen May, the current VP of People Development at Google, previously owned an HR consulting firm and actually turned down repeated offers to work for Google for four years. But Google were convinced of her value and patiently pursued her until she finally agreed to join the company. Traditionally, it’s the manager who controls employees’ workload, salary, promotions, sick days and so on. Yet at the same time, companies expect their employees to show initiative and autonomy in their job. See the contradiction? If you really want employees to own their jobs, do as Google does, liquidate status symbols and reduce bureaucratic hierarchy. Google’s most senior executives receive the same support, like resources and funding, as new employees and there are only four levels in the hierarchy: individual contributor, manager, director and vice president. Googlers are also trained to lead and influence through inspiration. Want a VP title? Then show how well you can lead your project and people first. But, as with any project, even if employees demonstrate ownership and influence, they still need a final decision maker. So how do you make the best decisions? Use data, not managerial opinion. That way decision-making is transparent and less biased. Thus, one of Google’s core principles is “Don’t politick. Use data.” This motto also helps address sensitive topics, especially when potentially damaging rumors are involved. Promotion is a touchy subject in every company, and this often exacerbated by gossip. But the Google VP responsible for people used her data to prove there were no biases surrounding promotions at Google. For example, although some people believed that working at Google’s HQ would guarantee a swift promotion, her data proved the promotion rate there was the same as at any other Google office. When properly managed with data and open discussion, a power handover to employees is incredibly effective, resulting in the implementation of the best ideas. Even when someone disagrees with a final decision, the reasoning behind it is clear to everyone. If you’ve worked in an office before, you’re probably familiar with the classic pattern of employee performance: a small number of top performers are responsible for most of the successes, and everyone else trails behind them with gradually decreasing performance. The best and worst performers make up the two tails of the performance curve. Both are the minority, while most employees are average performers, sitting in the middle of the curve. Most companies fire poor performers, then hire new employees who require extra training and can’t guarantee excellent performance. Even worse, companies also tend not to utilize their top performers. So how does Google use these two tails to its advantage? They place outstanding performers under the microscope and help out those who need to make improvements. Most companies also don’t think to study their best performers. This is a missed opportunity, as these are the people most familiar with best practices. How, then, do you study the best performers? Harvard professor Boris Groysberg’s research shows high performance is dependent on context. That means studying other companies’ best practices won’t help; you must study your own. Google do exactly this and study their best employees using an internal research team, PiLab or People and Innovation Lab. PiLab’s produced Project Oxygen. This showed how a great manager is critical for top engineer performance. In fact, Googlers working for the best managers performed five to 18 percent better than those managed by weaker managers. PiLab also determined the main traits of best manager practices so the company could teach them to the under-performing managers. Google also knows that in most cases, below average performance is the result of lack of skill or motivation, which may stem from personal issues or indicate a bigger problem in the team. Finally, to really reach those who need a boost, Google regularly identifies the bottom five percent of employees and offers them training, or tries to fit them into a more appropriate role within the company. $156.2 billion. That’s the annual dollar amount that American companies spent on training programs in 2011. Shockingly, though, most company expenditure on training goes down the drain. Why? Because the training is run by the wrong people, is sloppily designed, too general, or doesn’t get analyzed in a way that measures effectiveness. Training should deliver specific information that people will retain. A commonly held belief is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in any particular skill. But research by Anders Ericsson shows that the best way to master a skill is to split the work into smaller tasks and aim for a specific improvement in one of these small tasks through repetition, feedback and correction. McKinsey, a global consultancy firm, does this particularly well. McKinsey sends all second year consultants to an Engagement Leadership Workshop where they’re trained to deal with irate clients. First, the basic principles are taught, then consultants roleplay a scenario, and observe and discuss a video of their training. This process is repeated until the desired consultant behavior is achieved. The training is intensive and expensive, but it ensures that every consultant leaves the training with excellent standards and the ability to cope in the best possible way with angry customers. McKinsey understands that the best way to measure training isn’t by time or money spent, but through an improvement in behavior. Who, then, should you hire to train your employees? The great news is, they’re already in your company. When Google needs a trainer for sales representatives, it seeks out the best sales manager with the maximum amount of total sales and asks them to instruct lower performing sales representatives. When employees train other employees, not only does it save money, but it also creates a more close-knit community. Who can understand the problems of a Googler better than another Googler? Compensation can be a contentious issue. So how does Google go about it? Most companies are trapped in pay ceilings for each position and “fair” payment, with regulations specifying that salary differences for the same position may not exceed 20 percent. Unfortunately, this practice encourages top performers to look for better compensation elsewhere. Bill Gates reportedly said that a fantastic coder is worth 10,000 times more than an average coder. Google shares this mind-set, which is why you may think it pays “unfairly.” For instance, one worker may get a stock award of $10,000, while another worker in the same position might receive $1 million. You may also witness a top performer in a junior role getting paid far above an average performer in a senior role. But Google also learned there are often more effective ways to retain employees: offer experience rather than money. In 2004, Google established a Founders Award for performance. That year, Google awarded $12 million to two teams and the next year $45 million was divided among eleven teams. But internal surveys showed that this didn’t make Googlers happy. Quite the opposite. It led people to look for other jobs where the chances of getting a generous award were higher. Their mistake was rewarding with money instead of experiences, like a dinner for two or a team trip to Hawaii. It turned out these special occasions created more memories and brought teams together far better than cash could. But Google didn’t just give rewards when they were expected. In 2009, Google announced the real-time collaboration tool Google Wave. One team worked on it for two years and agreed to forgo their bonuses in favor of higher compensation via stocks if Wave succeeded. Sadly, it failed, but Google rewarded the team anyway. Why? Because innovation means exploring the unknown, so there should be rewards for people who take calculated risks, even if they fail. We’ve seen how empowering employees, transparency, and giving workers a voice have made Google so successful. Unfortunately, sometimes these practices backfire. But when they do, Google knows how to handle it. Google suffers one major leak per year. When this happens, it’s investigated and the guilty party, who leaked it either by accident or design, is found and fired. Not only that, but the company announces to everyone what was leaked and what happened to the employee who did it. The cost of a leak is small relative to the openness and transparency that the company values and upholds. What else can sometimes go awry? Well, Google’s culture fosters innovative thinking and this inevitably results in huge influxes of ideas, which have to be adjusted or culled periodically in order to keep the company running smoothly. In fact, between 2006 and 2009, more than 250 products were launched and then discontinued by Google. CEO Larry Page is responsible for the annual spring clean where he discontinues some products that are waning, don’t have great market prospects, or are being outperformed by others. By being open and explaining the reasoning behind each cull, Google manages to maintain its focus and direction, and retains its managers instead of angering them. Finally, sometimes even company perks can go sour. Google is famous for its benefits and when it provides them, at first everyone is delighted. But after some time, some employees can start to feel entitled. One employee, who became grumpy when the cafeteria used smaller plates, started throwing forks in the trash in protest, and some Googlers even threw food at the staff. The final straw was Meatless Monday, which was launched to benefit employee health. Yet after a month, only one employee threatened in an anonymous survey to move to Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft. So Google shared the survey with its employees. Consequently, many staff were embarrassed by the person's actions and the level of entitlement and abuse fell. The key message in this book: There’s a reason why everyone wants to work at Google. They understand how to hire and retain the best staff, utilize the expertise already present in the company, give power to their workers, and keep them happy in their job. By studying these strategies, you too can learn how to lead and maintain a company that enjoys great success. Actionable advice: Hire in teams. Confirmation bias can lead an individual to favoritize information or individuals that agree with their own beliefs. In job interviews it can cause employers to only take on people who echo their opinions or who resemble them. Avoid it when you’re hiring by assembling a team to sort through and interview applicants. By having more than one opinion on prospective employees, you’ll end up with a more diverse team. Take your time. Sometimes the hiring process can be frustrating, especially when time is of the essence. But holding out for the best new employee will most likely save money in the long run, as company funds won’t be wasted on training up someone average.

Some companies put out fruit baskets, others incentivize working out or using pedometers. These might seem better than companies that don’t offer any health initiatives at all, but workplace wellness isn’t just about fruits and pedometers.  Workplace wellness refers to any approach that allows employees to be more human at work. It’s about getting the opportunity to move more, to have fun and laugh on the job, to eat more natural foods, to build meaningful connections and to work towards a higher goal. It has more layers than just “being healthy” – it’s about feeling engaged, recognized and well at work. In these blinks, you’ll discover how putting family pictures on workers’ hard hats can increase security;  why Leonardo da Vinci should inspire your workplace wellness program; and how OzForex’s global vacation program creates a sense of fairness. What do you associate with a healthy workplace? Picking up the occasional apple from the break room? David from Accounts trying to enlighten you on the perils of cigarette smoke?  Workplace wellness is much more than that: it’s about enjoying your work environment, moving around more and building meaningful connections with other people. That sounds great, but how do you get there? By instigating a change process. When you take this initiative, you can become an agent of change for your workplace. This means understanding the reason for change and communicating it to others. Agents of change know their inner why – the reason underpinning the change – and this helps make them authentic, persuasive leaders of the process. Take Shane Valentine, who teaches for Kids Cook with Heart, a program offering cooking lessons to school children. Valentine’s inner why is that almost no children in the United States meet the American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 criteria for a healthy heart. In response to this, his program specifically addresses the criteria for a healthy diet. Once you have a why, you’ll need people to listen. Using metaphors and emotions is an effective way of communicating your message. To gain followers, you should focus on relating stories rather than regurgitating statistics. Start by building your own story bank, a collection of meaningful stories in your head. The key is to make sure you embody your story. If Valentine were to star in a commercial for McDonald’s, his kids cooking program would suddenly lose credibility! As a next step, you’ll need to build a strong case to convince your coworkers of the need to improve workplace wellness.  One approach could be to highlight any monetary gains that could be achieved by implementing workplace wellness. Take presenteeism, a money-draining phenomenon that occurs when your employees are at work but aren’t fully present, i.e., they’re either not working effectively or not working at all. According to a study at Bank One, 63 percent of costs connected with poor employee health are caused by presenteeism. Do you know what Mikaela Shiffrin said before she won the gold medal for the slalom race at the  2014 Winter Olympics? “To everybody, this is my first Olympics. But to me it’s my thousandth.” She was referring to her vision; she had visualized the race over and over to build faith in her success, which enabled her to win. So how does this apply to workplace well-being? Creating a vision allows you to believe in and realize a healthier workplace. You can start creating this vision by making a collage with images that answer the question: “What’s possible for your organization?” Posting your collage on a wall will guide and inspire you as you move through the process. That’s what Teresa Snyder, a team leader at a leading financial institution, did when she introduced her Get Vitality program. Her aim was to convince technically oriented employees of the value of soft skills and self-care, and how the two were related. When team members visualized people being kind to themselves and interacting positively with one another, it deepened the team’s understanding of the initiative. When forming your vision, make sure it’s multidimensional. Because well-being is, too.  Here are two key tenets to address: First, physical well-being. This involves eating healthily, not smoking, getting enough sleep and moving your body. The average American sits for a whopping 9.3 hours per day even though more than three hours of it can be bad for our health!  So what can you do about this at work? All it takes are simple things like standing up every 30 minutes or having stand-up or walking meetings. Then there is emotional well-being, also called resilience. This is your ability to bounce back from changes and it can be fostered by practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness entails paying attention to the present moment, deliberately and without judgment. One way to get started with this is to focus on one thing at a time at work, taking a break between two tasks and being observant of that break. Ever felt disengaged at the office? You’re not the only one! According to Gallup, 70 percent of the US workforce is disengaged at work. This is toxic for any work environment and costs around $450 billion per year. This isn’t good for any of us, but how can we tackle it? Let’s look at workplace culture, the basis for your organization’s well-being movement. Culture can encompass the shared values, social norms, rituals and philosophy of an organization, and it influences everything. Companies like online shoe retailer Zappos understand this and invest heavily in culture, resulting in them outperforming the competition. They believe people perform better if they have fun at work, so they provide free popcorn and costume parades for their staff. IDEO, a California-based design consultancy firm is another example. They created The Little Book of IDEO which lays out their values such as “Be optimistic” and “Collaborate” to clarify what it means to work there. Among the many things culture influences is engagement, which is crucial for your movement. In addition, everyone should feel supported by the organization. This is called perceived organizational support. If people feel encouraged and valued through regular feedback talks, for example, they’re more likely to engage in your program. But before you begin your program, you need to understand your organization’s current culture. One way of doing this is by using marbles. It’s almost a no-brainer, but it does give you a pretty clear picture of the company. Simply ask employees to indicate how their day went by placing a green (good), yellow (okay) or red (bad) marble into a jar. If you find a jar brimming with red marbles at the end of the day, you know that the culture needs some serious attention! Once you’ve understood your organization’s culture, you’re now in a good position to create positive change. If given the choice, which activity would you do first: something you’re bad at or something you’re good at? Most likely the latter! And that’s exactly where your wellness programs should start, too. To get your movement off to a flying start: focus on strengths, both on the individual and organizational levels. For business book author Marcus Buckingham, strengths are activities that make you feel strong after you’ve done them; contrary to weaknesses, which make you feel depleted.  According to Gallup, strengths correlate with engagement: people whose work is centered on their strengths are six times more likely to be highly engaged in it. This is similar to the perspective of Patty de Vries, Wellness Manager of HealthySteps, a wellness program run between Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. According to de Vries, there are two ways to approach any new situation: with fear or love. She favors love, since this builds on strength. Think of it this way: Would you rather go to a military-like gym where a trainer screams orders at you telling you how pathetic you are or a gym where someone cheers for your success? So how can you use peoples’ strengths, or bright spots, to know where to focus in your program? To pinpoint strengths, have everyone individually stick green or red dots on a vitality wheel, where the green dots represent things they’re good at and the red dots things they’re not good at. The vitality wheel is split into six dimensions of well-being: career, physical, emotional, community, financial and social. Just by acknowledging what they’re good at will give employees the necessary energy to handle the red spots. To find your organization’s bright spots, aim to answer the following questions:  “How is your company supporting the employees?” – this might be health services, yoga classes or a credit union – and “What are successes of your company’s already established workplace wellness?”.  Answers to these questions should give you your starting points. Does your company offer healthy perks? In Berlin startups, for example, it’s normal to have free fruit in a communal eating area. But just offering healthy snacks doesn’t necessarily increase the overall well-being of your employees. So how can you take your well-being movement to the next level? Take some advice from Leonardo da Vinci. Having been a painter, inventor, engineer and botanist (among other things), da Vinci is a symbol of interdisciplinarity and a fantastic inspiration for your movement. Use this interdisciplinary approach and consider all the connected departments when you select team members for your movement. You might need people from Facility Management, IT, Marketing and so on. Here’s an example of how they can all contribute: Facility Management could be responsible for sites you need, such as a fitness center; IT could help with a mobile app for services you wish to offer; marketing could assist with motivating and selling your idea to your staff. And don’t forget about people outside the company: community resources like the American Heart Association can give nutritional advice or information on heart disease. A great example is the Kids Cook with Heart program that we saw in the first blink. Health insurance providers could also provide free biometric screenings. You can broaden your da Vinci team even further with external departments such as safety or organizational development departments. Dow Chemical, the second-biggest chemical manufacturer in the world, has brought together health and safety departments for over 20 years and is heading towards zero injuries and zero adverse events. In addition, executives and managers can give voice to the movement through the company. Senior positions could help with their knowledge, and managers make excellent contributors if they take part in the wellness activities themselves.  Getting a variety of people on board is the first step toward getting everyone on board. Some people will roll their eyes at the mere mention of wellness initiatives: they just don’t buy into it or they mistake it for esoteric nonsense. So how can we convince them otherwise? Well, there are two ways to win over skeptics. The first is renaming, and it’s the perfect way to sneak well-being into the workplace. Expressions connected to wellness can be easily replaced by words that have less of a stigma to them. Health can be replaced with energy, for instance, and mental health with emotional intelligence. At Goldman Sachs, Head of Wellness Laura Young wanted to avoid the term stress management due to its negative connotation and instead opted for mindfulness and resilience. This worked well: the company offers one mindfulness session each quarter, with over 500 people signing up for it every time. Another way to persuade the skeptics is by pretending to withdraw the idea of a wellness program. This means appearing to give up the fight, but instead blending it cleverly into other programs that are already valued and embraced by your organization. For example, Solano County in California integrated some well-being training into their usual manager’s meeting under the guise of sustainable management. These managers learned how to increase their own well-being, as well as improve the work environment of their employees. You can also use your da Vinci team to open up more entry points into your company. One way could be to hold community outreach activities as a means to give back to your community. This is directly linked to at least two facets of well-being: physical activity and the sense of purpose you feel when you volunteer to help others. Salesforce, a sales and marketing software provider, has a 1-1-1 model for philanthropy: 1 percent of Salesforce’s equity, 1 percent of its product and 1 percent of its employees’ time are all given to a good cause. So you started with the easy things and slipped in your wellness program. Now, how can you maintain motivation? By instilling feelings of competency, autonomy and relatedness. To make people feel competent, ask them to share their knowledge and experience. We all have insights and stories about what we do to feel good. Even a simple weight-loss story could be incredibly helpful to staff. To satisfy the need for autonomy, support employees while they take control of their health and well-being. Leaving room to allow people to find solutions for themselves, or enabling staff go back to college to finish a degree, will encourage fulfillment and independence. Regarding relatedness, research shows that people like being in teams and perform better when they’re part of a group. Schindler Canada, an elevator producer, did an excellent job of relating safety to employees’ families by placing pictures of family members on the safety helmets of their employees. As a result, safety regulations were followed far more diligently. In addition to the above, feelings of purpose and the joy of play strengthen motivation. Feeling that your life has meaning and purpose gives you energy, so find time to reflect on this. For instance, staff at fashion company Eileen Fisher begin every meeting with a moment of reflection. Play is vital, too – we love playing! According to Stuart Brown, Professor at Berkeley, play is the basis for social relations, happiness and fulfillment. Volkswagen integrated play into their work environment by transforming the stairs next to an escalator into piano key stairs, complete with sound! This resulted in 66 percent more employees choosing the musical stairs that got them moving over the less healthy escalator. Ever wondered about the fly stuck in the center of male urinals? This is what’s known as a nudge. This unassuming fly increases accuracy, as men will naturally aim for it when they use the facilities! What does that have to do with workplace wellness, you ask? Nudges and cues are highly effective approaches to behavioral change. By making small adjustments to the environment according to your wellness initiative, nudges and cues coax us into behaving differently. A nudge could be an invitation to do something, for example, by making the healthy option the easiest option. If there were apples and bananas on display at the cafeteria cash register instead of candy bars, people would probably grab them as a quick snack. A cue is more cultural and concerns which activities are considered normal and which aren’t. Take a look at the success of social cues of smoking in the U.S.: In the 1960s, it was normal to smoke and almost half of the population smoked. Nowadays, only 18 percent of Americans smoke. It’s become abnormal, and actually feels abnormal, to smoke in the U.S. In fact, it wouldn’t be out of place for someone to confront you about the ill effects of smoking if you light up around others. The great thing is, nudges and cues have as many applications as ideas for increasing well-being. Here are a few tips you can try at your workplace: to improve the physical aspect of well-being, try nudges like signposting stairwells or outlining indoor walkways to make walking meetings more appealing. Some cues could be policies that every meeting under 30 minutes should be a stand-up meeting or taking part in rituals like morning stretches. To support the emotional aspect of well-being, you could integrate mindfulness practices to kick off meetings, and to enhance the social part of your wellness initiative, you could provide on-site childcare or a central sunny atrium area. You’ve recognized the downfalls of your workplace and shored up some fantastic health-boosting strategies. Now it’s time to launch your program. Take a look at the following tips and insights for the best way to jump-start your movement. First, learning through doing and encouraging a growth mindset in your organization will ease your staff into your wellness program. Learning through doing means not delaying your program until it’s perfect. Just launch it, and then fine-tune it as you go. Take design company IDEO, which actually urges people to have this trial-and-error attitude. They even dedicate a program to it – called Fail Faster! A growth mindset means believing in the power of change for all people at all times. It’s never too late to get onboard with this way of thinking and you can foster it by posting questions like “What do you stand for?” on social media platforms and in employee bathrooms. Once your program is running, monitor it, and assess staff engagement and its organizational impact. This will make refining and improving it far easier. In addition to counting participants, you can use the following methods to get a better feeling for employee engagement:  Start by observing how people look when taking part in the program. Speak with them, ask them how they like the program, and observe what happens after a big event. Do you notice any lasting changes? To see your movement from another perspective, measure its impact on an organizational level. For instance, are there changes in absenteeism, presenteeism (remember, when you’re physically present but mentally disengaged) or productivity? Have medical costs decreased? Has the rate of injuries dropped? Has the quality of your employees’ lives changed? If you monitor your program closely and stay up to date with your da Vinci team, you shouldn’t have anything to worry about during the launch. If trouble does crop up somewhere, though, don’t fret – just tweak it in the next iteration. If you’re part of an international company, getting local staff to participate in your program is great, but what comes next? Starting to think big. Now it’s time to start spreading your movement throughout company branches all over the world. This can be best achieved by cultivating a global mindset in your organization. The first part of this mindset involves unitizing standards inside your company. This can also increase well-being by encouraging a culture of fairness. OzForex is a great example of this. OzForex is a multinational foreign exchange company with headquarters in Australia and many international offices all over the globe. They decided, in accordance with the normal and guaranteed four weeks of holidays in Australia, that they would start offering these holidays to all offices throughout the organization so that all employees could benefit from it. To further inspire consideration for the company at large, you could also incorporate the following questions into your next workshop:  Stress, anxiety and depression are growing exponentially all over the world. Why do you think this is? How can you address these taboo topics at work, and what can you do to counteract these statistics? Another thing you can do to spread your message is learn from partners inside and outside your company via sharing best practices. Each department in your company is different and will therefore experience your wellness program differently. Sharing these experiences will be helpful for everyone. For example, the India office of network provider Brocade tailored the name of their WellFit program to speakers of different languages. In Kannada, the local language in the Indian region of Bangalore, it’s called Kursi biDu, Stretches maaDu.  In the realm of teaching, EdVillage is a small nonprofit and highlights outstanding education all over the world. Taking it one step further, EdVillage also facilitates the sharing of best practices between teachers internationally to improve education worldwide. The key message in this book: Workplace well-being is crucial for every organization. By being an agent of change with the help of a diverse team, you can create, instigate and develop healthy programs and habits that everyone in your company can benefit from. Actionable advice: Cut the candy. There are simple nudges, or changes to the environment, which can improve eating and drinking habits at your company. For example, you could offer healthier options in vending machines and cafeterias. Rather than stocking up with sugar-filled candy bars, you could replace these with nut-, fruit- or vegetable-based snacks. You could also switch out candy and cookies in meetings for fruit or carrot and celery sticks with a healthy dip to make an unhealthy choice simply not an option! You may even install an on-site garden that enables staff to grow their own food and take it back home. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Choosing to pick up the latest tome from a business leader or academic makes sense. But what if you want to really shake things up? How about exploring what some of today’s leading comedians have to say about thinking outside the box? It might not seem obvious, but the skills and techniques of improvisational comedy can be readily applied to the business world. On stage without a script, a comedian has to be innovative at a moment’s notice and to think on her feet to solve urgent problems. Sound like the daily challenges of a business leader? You bet. Based on the experiences of the team at The Second City, the ensemble behind today’s top comedic talents, these blinks will give you unique insight into how improv skills can help you succeed. In these blinks, you’ll discover whether laughter really is the best medicine; why you need to grow an ensemble and not a team; and why you should answer every question with “yes, and…” Have you ever seen an improv comedy show? Seemingly on the spot, actors share hilariously creative and detailed stories. It’s not magic, however; comedians all use a particular, essential tool that gives them a platform to explore a multitude of ideas. This strategy is called the “yes, and” mind-set. But how exactly does it work? When an actor uses “yes, and,” she is agreeing to follow through on or add to any narrative started by a collaborator on stage. Here’s an example. Actor A opens by looking skyward and saying, “What a beautiful night. I can see all the stars.” If Actor B ignored the “yes, and” strategy, she might say, “What are you talking about? It’s daytime.” This deviation from the starting theme could kill the conversation. But if Actor B was in tune and playing by “yes, and,” she’d further the narrative by saying, “Yes, and the earth looks so small. It’s great we finally took this trip to the moon.” The genius of “yes, and” is that this strategy opens up unlimited possibilities, by giving every idea the chance to show its potential. And this technique applies to much more than just improv. You don’t have to look hard to see applications of “yes, and” in the business world, for example. The online collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia is a prime example of what can be accomplished when a large group embraces the “yes, and” attitude. On the site, a user starts an article and others build upon it. In this way, the very nature of the site requires that users add to the work of others. While there are drawbacks of such a collaborative approach (such as inaccuracies), this free, universally used website would’ve never been possible without the creative synergy of “yes, and.” Many of us take for granted that a strong business requires strong teams. Yet the idea of a team implies that its members are competing with an outside force, usually another team. This mentality, of team against team, damages the open, free-thinking potential of “yes, and.” Seeing business as a battle can hinder, not encourage, a group’s creativity. Instead, build ensembles. An ensemble is a group without a hierarchy, free from competition and thus capable of nurturing unlimited creativity. In a team, roles and positions tend to be clearly defined and members learn early to stick to them. In an ensemble, everyone can chip in whenever and wherever they want, creating something that’s greater than the sum of its parts. Two of the most inspirational modern choreographers, Alvin Ailey and Twyla Tharp, created legendary routines by letting dancers add their own ideas, rather than making them just follow instructions. So how do you build your ensemble? Don’t just search for the best performers, but rather look for people who are the best fit for your group. An ensemble is only as strong as its ability to compensate for its weakest link. It’s therefore crucial to choose members who can offer what an ensemble needs. For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, The Second City improv comedy ensemble was composed almost entirely of white men. As a result, the ensemble’s creativity stagnated, given the relatively limited breadth of experience of its members. Instead of trying to solve its problems with star performers, however, Second City hired instead people of different races and sexual orientations. This diversity stimulated creativity, allowing the ensemble to not only come up with innovative material but also poke fun at contemporary taboo topics. While seeking diversity may have caused the ensemble to miss top performers, the strategy actually put together the strongest ensemble. When you have a great idea, are you usually open to letting other people tweak or change it altogether? Most people certainly aren’t. While it’s understandable to want to retain ownership of your idea, controlling your ideas too tightly can deter co-creation and stifle creativity. When working collaboratively, it’s essential to be open to allowing others to change or build upon your ideas. This might mean your idea gets entirely transformed, but this is not a crisis. What’s ultimately important is not finding your idea, but the idea. The best idea! But what happens when people don’t respect this mantra? Canada’s Second City Television (SCTV) was a comedy sketch program similar to the U.S. program, Saturday Night Live. The program was a rare example of horizontal collaboration, in that creatives used ideas from everyone, including the wardrobe, makeup and hair departments, when developing sketches. It was hugely popular. But when U.S. network NBC picked up the show in 1981, it brought in new management more familiar with a top-down, traditional creative approach. The SCTV cast and crew, who had earned some 15 Emmy nominations before the merger, were turned off by this stifling of their creativity, and many top performers left. The key to creativity lies in a collaborative approach, one which is best described as “everyone should bring a brick so the group can build a cathedral.” But collaboration doesn’t come easy. One major roadblock to co-creation is fear. Fear comes in many forms: fear of failure, of appearing foolish or fear of the unknown. Yet you have to eradicate fear wherever and however it rears its head. To do so, there are a couple of easy steps to take. One is to ban yelling in your ensemble, as raised voices can intimidate people. Would you feel more comfortable sharing unpolished ideas or thoughts in a hostile environment or in one that made you feel safe and welcome? The answer is obvious. Your boss is making everyone work overtime, again. You’re stressed, the atmosphere is tense and everyone is quiet. Then someone cracks a joke and everyone laughs. Suddenly, the environment transforms: people start talking freely and, as a result, loosen up and start thinking more creatively. How did such a dismal situation become a fun, light-hearted and productive one? The answer is comedy. Comedy can be a powerful tool for dispelling tension. Unfortunately, there’s no recipe for comedy. Or is there? One potential recipe for comedy combines three things: a situation everyone is familiar with, a pain we can identify with and share, and critically, a safe mental distance from topics that cause offense. Consider a skit The Second City team performed in the late 1990s during the Monica Lewinsky scandal in the United States. A married couple stands in their kitchen. Every time the husband approaches, the wife turns her head, effectively giving him the silent treatment. Finally he pleads, “Hillary…” The audience laughs, as they recognize the reference to the current public scandal, share the pain of marital infidelity, and aren’t necessarily offended, as few audience members are likely intimates with the U.S. president or his wife. Another way to facilitate a creative environment is to adopt a stance that respects but doesn’t revere other people and their ideas. What’s the difference? Respect is holding a healthy esteem for something, while reverence can become an immobilizing awe. When you respect something rather than revere it, you can give your honest opinion of it, point out imperfections and share ideas on how it could improve. Kodak for decades was a household name, but quickly fell apart with the advent of digital cameras, even though the company had actually invented the technology itself. So what happened?   The company had too much reverence for its star product, analog film. As a result, it didn’t jump on the digital film bandwagon until it was too late, and eventually had to file for bankruptcy. Have you ever been paralyzed by a fear of failure? You’re certainly not alone if so. Fear of failure is common and a major limitation to company innovation. Yet how does one build a culture of fearlessness? It takes a lot more than just slapping a couple of inspirational posters on the wall. One key to overcoming the fear of failure is to foster a low-risk environment that allows for a quick recovery when failure does occur. Yet what exactly does this look like? By lowering the stakes of failure, you create an environment that lets failure, and in turn learning from mistakes, occur as quickly as possible. The Chicago-based software developer Basecamp routinely holds “product roasts,” a meeting in which employees criticize their product and talk about all its failures collectively. The event creates a safe environment that encourages employees to admit to and acknowledge failures, in order to improve by learning from them. In another example, advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather holds an annual mock awards ceremony for “career-endangering stunts.” During this silly event, everyone has the chance to acknowledge imperfections and mistakes common to all employees. But what’s the point of these goofy evenings and roasts? Disarming the scary face of failure quickly and with a joke lets people move on to solving problems, while facilitating a healthy attitude toward risk that results in better overall morale. Better morale leads to more creativity, too. Another key is building an atmosphere of mutual trust that motivates people to take risks without making them feel individually responsible for goofs. In short, people should feel like if they fail, the entourage has their back; that is, they all fail together. Before a performance, The Second City actors exchange hugs and words of encouragement. This simple gesture reminds each member that they’re supported and reinforces the idea that the group both fails together and succeeds together. What does an effective leader look like? Many of us might say that a leader needs to take charge, make decisions and give orders. Correct? Well, the entourage at The Second City would beg to differ. Being a good leader is about understanding status instead of maintaining it. This means a good leader knows that sometimes the most powerful thing she can do as a leader is to empower others to lead. To get the most out of each employee’s expertise, it’s important to let people in key positions be the spark that ignites new, potentially game-changing ideas. Viola Spolin, a pioneer of improvisational theater, promoted the idea of following the follower. This methodology lets any member of a group temporarily become a leader when the individual’s expertise best applies to the new situation. When a situation changes, presenting a new set of needs, so does the leader, offering a new set of skills. Having a leader best-suited for the current needs of a group is important, but good leadership is also about setting the right parameters. As a leader, you need to set reasonable timelines and provide the necessary resources to leave your creatives free to do their thing. While it’s good to touch base with your ensemble, it’s essential to avoid intruding on their work before they are ready to share it. At The Second City, once rehearsals start, no one but the actors and directors are allowed in the studio without an invitation. Even producers need a director’s permission to preview a show. The Second City enforces this as the possibility of a snap judgment, especially early in the process, can have a negative effect on the creative process overall. When people know they are being judged, inhibitions set in and can prevent them from taking risks, which severely limits creativity. How well we listen can be the difference between running a successful business and a failing one. Everyday we experience situations that require us to hear and respond to others, an impossible task for an individual lacking strong listening skills. But why is listening such an important skill? Simple: most people don’t do it. According to a Forbes survey, although we get 85 percent of our knowledge from listening, we only comprehend 25 percent of what we hear. Furthermore, only 2 percent of professionals have any formal training in how to listen better. These statistics are even more shocking when we consider the costs of poor listening. Companies that don’t listen to customers develop products that nobody asked for and for which there is no demand – like New Coke, Coca-Cola’s infamous misadventure in revising the recipe of its flagship soda. Fortunately, there’s good news for those of us who have problems with listening. Listening is like a muscle that can be strengthened, if you change your habits and do exercises. A common bad habit when trying to listen is to focus on a response while totally missing out on what the other person is saying. One way to overcome this is to listen to understand. This means focusing solely on the other person’s words instead of on your response. Doing so keeps you in the present moment, drastically increasing your comprehension. The Second City once consulted an ad agency on the issue of client retention. To teach listening skills, the group had employees perform an exercise that required them to make eye contact, establishing a connection, before speaking to a person. This helped ensure the other person was listening. In another exercise, an account executive spoke gibberish while her colleague was tasked with translating. By taking into account all possible information, from her intonation to the way she was standing, her colleague was able to translate the nonsense into comprehensible speech. This showed the power of truly listening! And by applying these new listening skills, the agency acquired new clients and had no trouble keeping them! The key message in this book: Taking lessons from the world of improvisational theater can help you build a creative, collaborative and fearless environment in which your business ensemble can succeed. It’s as simple as applying the techniques of the “yes, and” strategy, empowering those in key positions and ensuring that team members know that if they fail, they all fail together.  Actionable advice: Build your listening skills by not using the word “I.” Here’s a great improv lesson that will help hone listening skills and partnership skills. Have your team form pairs and start a conversation about any topic. The only rule: no one can use the word “I.” in doing so, each participant will better focus on the other, and in the process, both will improve their listening skills!

As technological and scientific developments continue to unroll, this trend can only increase in the future. Yet if we all keep living longer and longer, there will – of course – be many societal effects. The global population will increase, there will be more elderly people who need looking after than ever before, and a larger workforce will face economic problems. How will we cope? In these blinks we discover that our worst fears about this new world are largely false. Even though we will all live to a ripe old age, society will cope and even blossom. In these blinks you’ll discover why the first person to live to 1,000 may already live amongst us; why we might have to cope with a younger brother 50 years our junior; and how you can “hack” genes. What separates humans from animals? Most would say that it’s the awareness that we’re going to die someday. This knowledge of our fate – and the motivation to change it – has occupied human thought for millennia. Death used to be understood by the ancients as punishment from the gods for human transgression or immorality. In Ancient Greece it was believed that our mortality, illness and suffering was Zeus’ retribution for accepting the gift of fire from the titan Prometheus. Our ancestors devoted a lot of time to trying to cheat this fate. People in ancient and medieval civilizations were preoccupied with slowing down or even stopping the aging process. For instance, although the practice of alchemy was famously concerned with turning base metals into gold, alchemists were also fixated on immortality and elixirs that would extend our lives. Yet despite their attempts to transcend death, our ancestors were also aware that becoming immortal might not always be desirable. A great example of this is found in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels. Gulliver visits the land of Luggnagg, where a small minority known as “struldbrugs” are born immortal. At first Gulliver delights in this fact, but then slowly realizes that it’s a curse. The struldbrugs enjoy a wonderful youth, but when they age, their health deteriorates as they lose their teeth and hair, and they are unable to speak. They end up embittered and detached from society. So our ancestors desired immortality, yet dreaded compromising their health as a result. In the next blink we’ll see how modern science is tackling this issue by both preventing aging and keeping us healthier for longer. Most of us want to live long lives, but many of us don’t want to do so in pain or infirmity. Fortunately, modern science is finding ways to alleviate this dilemma by helping us lead longer and healthier lives. New medical technology is even enabling us to treat diseases that we haven’t been able to heal before. Tissue engineering is one of these breakthroughs. In 2008, Claudia Castillo survived tuberculosis, only for the left branch of her windpipe to collapse, cutting off air to her left lung. Previously the only solution to mitigate the damage would have involved removing the entire left lung – an operation with a high risk of death. However, Claudia received a new treatment, in which stem cells were taken from her bone marrow and “seeded” into a donated windpipe, which was then transplanted into her body. The procedure was successful, and in a matter of weeks, her full lung capacity was restored. Two months later, she was dancing in Ibiza. Regeneration is another recent medical marvel. We observe this in nature when a salamander loses a leg and miraculously grows another one. Scientists are now beginning to emulate this process for humans. When patient Deepa Kulkarni accidentally cut off the tip of her finger, it was dipped in a new kind of material called extracellular matrix (ECM), which prevents scarring and stimulates tissue growth. Seven weeks after treatment, her finger had grown back to its normal size. Progress in genomics will also help us by making screening and treatment of diseases more effective. The sequencing of human genomes, for example, is becoming faster and more affordable. With access to someone’s entire genome we can personalize cancer and HIV treatments, making them more effective. We’re entering a time when scientists can prevent diseases and help our bodies regenerate. In the years to come, many of us will enjoy a far more pleasant and longer life. Yet if we achieve lengthened, healthy life spans, is this always a good thing? We’ll see in the next blink. Advances in science and medicine have been so significant that it’s been suggested that the first of us to live to 1,000 has already been born. But, as impressive as this progress is, what about the moral implications? Is this something we should encourage? Is living longer necessarily better? Despite what the critics may say, it is! Scientist Leon R. Kass posits that greatly extended life spans are incompatible with human nature. He argues that if we lived longer, we would lose interest in life and struggle to find meaning. Surely it’s our looming death that provides our lives with purpose? But having an extended, healthy life span won’t make us less human. For example, in 1850 life expectancy was around 42. It would therefore be absurd to say that we used to be “more human” simply because we had a more potent fear of dying sooner. In fact, humans are remarkably adept at coping with change, and increased life spans are just a form of change. Another objection to extending our lives is that it’s a poor use of resources. Yet this is untrue. Dr. Audrey Chapman of the Connecticut Health Center says that it’s simply immoral to invest in expensive longevity enhancement technologies and aging research while those in developing countries are dying young from easily treatable diseases. The trouble is, this view wrongly assumes an either/or situation and doesn’t recognize the potential health advantages this research could offer poorer communities. There are multiple factors that add to injustice and inequality. Aging research isn’t a significant part of any wealthy nations’ budget, and singling it out as immoral seems unreasonable. We needn’t become pessimistic about our future aging population, but what will it actually look like? In the following blinks we’ll find out. It seems inevitable that if the same number of people continue to be born while our life spans increase, the world will soon become crammed with people. According to many, this growth will be massive, leading to a lack of resources and dangerous environmental repercussions. But is this true? Actually, the effect of long lives on population growth isn’t as big as you might expect. Researchers at the University of Chicago created a model to estimate the growth of populations around the world, assuming fertility rates remained at today’s levels. Using data from Sweden, they found that even if Swedes stopped aging completely, the Swedish population would only increase by 22 percent over the course of one hundred years. And a larger, older population won’t necessarily mean a scarcity of resources, nor have a long-term damaging impact on the environment. In his 1968 book, The Population Bomb, Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich predicted that as we approached the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people would starve from lack of food. The opposite happened. The daily calorie intake per capita has been increasing all over the world ever since, and is predicted to continue creeping up, despite the population increase. The idea that negative impact on the environment can be blamed on a larger, older population may also be far-fetched. According to Bill Gates, we don’t often take into account the power and influence of the human mind. A larger population means more ideas and innovation that will help us curtail any harmful impact on the environment. Also, as we live longer, we’re more inclined to think about our future needs and therefore become more environmentally conscious. One consequence of living longer is that we would have more time to form relationships and have children. It’s probable we would do this several times over, which would have interesting implications. New fertility technology will enable women to have children later – an example of which occurred in 2008 when an Indian woman called Devi gave birth to a healthy child at the age of 70. Fertility technology is progressing swiftly and will make late pregnancies less risky and more common. One consequence of this is that there will potentially be a wider age gap between siblings. Currently, there are seldom age differences of over 20 years between siblings. However, if we were to live to 150, which may not be that far off according to researchers, age differences of 40, or even 50 years could become fairly normal. Another byproduct of having children later will be a rising number of aging, decrepit parents, who would have difficulty handling and playing with their kids. However, if science can improve our health and vitality even as we age, this may not be such a concern. Living longer could also lead to a greater variety in our family structure. Until fairly recently, it was commonplace for a child to grow up without one or both of its biological parents. In the past, war, disease, and death in childbirth made remarriage with existing children or adoption fairly usual. As we start to live longer and have more relationships throughout our lifetime, it’s likely that we’ll go back to these family relationships built on social bonds (between stepchildren, foster parents, and so on), rather than the biological ones that we experience today. Some people fret about the impact a larger and older population will have on the economy. Who’s going to pay for all these old people and their pensions? But living longer might turn out to be an economic advantage. According to economists David Bloom and David Canning, if one country has a life expectancy five years higher than another, then, all other factors remaining equal, the real income per capita will rise 0.3 to 0.5 percent faster in the “healthier” country. Why is this? One reason is that longer living results in a workforce that is better educated, paving the way for a more robust economy. Also, if we live longer, we experience greater benefits from higher wages. If you work for 40 years after studying, that means 40 years of higher wages, but if you work 70 years after studying, you can enjoy those wages for 70 years. What’s more, when educated people stay in work, the pool of educated workers will broaden as more graduates keep flowing into the job market. Economists Rodolfo Manuelli and Ananth Seshadri have shown that the difference in economic output between countries is linked to fluctuations in human capital (a society’s combined knowledge and skills), and education has a large effect on this. Global studies have shown that the poorest countries have the most to gain economically from increased longevity, as the potential for increased wealth and income from longevity is greater in these places. For example, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a study that showed that between 1965 and 1995, the welfare gains due to increased longevity were 27 percent of GDP for Mexico versus just five percent for the far wealthier United States. How would a world where we live exceedingly long lives and seldom experience disease and death change religion? What impact would longevity have on spirituality? As we live longer, the concept of an afterlife will start to lose its appeal. All the major world religions point to some kind of afterlife. In fact, anthropologist Ernest Becker famously said that without death, religion would not exist. Belief in an afterlife assuages many people’s anxiety and is a great attraction of many faiths. Yet as science enables us to live longer, major religions will need to draw focus to other things in order to stay relevant. Living longer will give us more time to ponder the big questions in life and make room for new sorts of spirituality. Livia Kohn, religious studies professor at Boston University and an expert on Daoism, predicts that the question of how to fill our time and organize our lives will become increasingly important as we move closer to what was once our ultimate goal: immortality. Some kind of spiritual guidance may be able to help us navigate our lives. The futurist Ray Kurzweil calls for a new kind of religion. Kurzweil is a member of a movement sometimes referred to as “transhumanism,” which holds that we’re coming to a point, or “singularity,” where science and technology will enable us to eclipse the limitations of our biology. In his book The Singularity is Near, Kurzweil considers the need for a new religion based on reverence for human consciousness and knowledge. As we witness more dramatic changes to human life with new technology, this movement is likely to gain momentum. As with any movement, the movement for longevity requires ambassadors and spokespeople to continue to raise and attract funding. There are many ways to help this cause. Proliferating the idea or “meme” that healthy life extension is achievable and worth investing in will garner support and add to public understanding of the issue. One example of this is Oprah Winfrey’s shows on longevity, and her support for doctors like Mehmet Oz, who have become influential by giving advice on how we can live longer, healthier lives. Biology has become the new growth area for engineering as scientists experiment with genes, finding ways to make cells glow or even smell like banana. This surge is not unlike the beginnings of the personal computer revolution, except instead of hacking electronics, now we can hack genes. Movers and shakers in the technology industry such as Google’s Larry Page and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen are already keenly interested in biohacking. We can encourage the longevity movement through incentive prizes and investments in biohacking, increasing the chances of discovering ways to live longer and more healthily. The $10-million Archon Genomics XPRIZE is geared toward speeding up and reducing costs for genome sequencing. Physicist Stephen Hawkings is one of its supporters, as he believes such prizes will lead to the treatment of serious diseases. So we can see there is huge potential here. But in order to progress further, politicians and policymakers need to understand how to promote new technologies and utilize the insights and knowledge we can gain from biohacking. The key message in this book: New technologies and progress in science are already providing us with ways to live much longer and healthier lives. As our life spans extend, this will have a huge impact on society and the way we approach our existence. However, humanity is creative enough and strong enough to deal with this, and we shouldn’t fear an aging, growing population.

There’s also little debate around the fact that the US and China currently have the largest concentration of bright minds working to develop these applications. China is so determined to become the world superpower in AI that they’re doing whatever it takes to pave the way for a booming AI industry. This includes heavily subsidizing the rent for AI-tech start-ups, and setting up one-stop-shops to make it easy to launch a new start-up. The Chinese government is even securing placements at competitive schools for the kids of start-up executives. Is it enough to topple the giants of Silicon Valley? Author Kai-Fu Lee has spent years in both Silicon Valley and its Chinese equivalent, Zhongguancun. He believes China is in a great position beat Silicon Valley, reign supreme in the new AI-based economy and thereby change the world order. In these blinks, you’ll find out how the Chinese version of Groupon became one of the world’s biggest start-ups; how WeChat became the world’s biggest super-app; and how a cancer scare made the author rethink our relationship to AI. Until recently, if people were talking about artificial intelligence (AI), it was likely in the context of science-fiction. But these days, everyone from schoolkids to CEOs are wondering what kind of changes AI has in store for us in the coming years. In fact, when the author gives talks at schools and executive conferences, he’s found that Chinese kindergarten students ask him the same questions as CEOs, such as, “Are we going to have AI teachers?” and “What kind of jobs are we going to have in the future?” While the emergence of real-world AI can seem like a relatively new thing, it’s been brewing for decades and has only now started being a major business tool thanks to a breakthrough in deep learning. The story of how we got to deep learning stretches back to the 1950s, when researchers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy had a goal of imbuing computers with human intelligence. And when the author started getting involved in this field in the early eighties, there were two camps working toward this: the rule-based people and the neural network folks. Rule-based AI believed that the best results would come from programming machines with one rule at a time, such as “cats have triangular-shaped ears.” The neural network camp, on the other hand, preferred to let the machine learn on its own, much as humans do, through experience. This way, a machine can analyze a picture of a cat and respond incorrectly, but this error will become data that it learns from. What neural network-based AI really needed was loads of data to analyze and faster computing power, which finally arrived in the mid-2000s. With the improved conditions, AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton was able to finally add the right amount of layers to the “neurons” and essentially multiply the AI processing power to a whole new level. When this happened, neural network was rebranded to deep learning. The big breakthrough was made public at a 2012 contest when Hinton’s new AI algorithm blew away the competition at visual recognition. Suddenly, AI was capable of processing complex problems, recognizing patterns and coming up with amazing results. It was clear that this technology was now applicable to a whole array of everyday functions, including visual and audio recognition, making complex financial decisions and even driving a car. Thanks to deep learning, an AI economy was on the way. In China, artificial intelligence had what the author calls a “Sputnik moment” in 2016. It happened when the AI program known as AlphaGo beat the champion Go player, Lee Sedol in a three-game tournament. These games had 280 million Chinese viewers glued to their TVs, and many were heartbroken when the visibly emotional Lee admitted defeat. But rather than breaking the people’s spirit, the people of China became inspired to harness the power of AI to their advantage – much like the launch of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, rallied Americans to be the first on the moon. And just as John F. Kennedy declared US intentions to land on the moon, following the Go tournament, the Chinese government issued a rallying cry declaring their ambition to become the global leader of AI innovation within the next ten years. This is particularly remarkable since just a few years prior, China was known more for being a hub of copycat technology than for its innovation. Indeed, in the early 2000s, China was copying every successful Silicon Valley product. This caused many in the West to write off China’s abilities as an innovative competitor. What the doubters failed to recognize though is that by being copycats, Chinese entrepreneurs were actually learning how to make their own world-class products. The best example may be Wang Xing, who made copycat Friendster, Facebook, Twitter and Groupon sites. In doing so, Wang not only learned how to design seamless products, he became a battle-hardened competitor who knew how to thrive in the cutthroat Chinese market. So by the time he turned his attention to his group discount service Meituan, he was ready to outperform Groupon itself. This time around, Wang didn’t copy the interface. He made it Chinese-friendly with densely-packed page designs. He also held back from overspending early on to woo customers and instead spent money for the long-term win by signing exclusive deals with vendors and creating a fast and reliable payment system. Unlike Groupon, Wang didn’t try to coast on one idea, either. He expanded and offered new products based on whatever was popular at the time, including movies, food delivery and local tourism. So, by 2014, Groupon was on the decline, selling for less than half its IPO, while Meituan was becoming the fourth most valuable start-up in the world. There are some fundamental differences between Silicon Valley’s and China’s start-ups, and a big one is having what’s known as a light or heavy touch. When a business has a light touch, it does one thing and leaves a lot of the particulars surrounding that service for others to deal with. This is the style of Silicon Valley companies like Uber, which connects people with a ride, but doesn’t deal with gas and car maintenance. The Chinese equivalent of Uber is Didi, and Didi also owns the gas stations and repair shops that keep their rides in service. This heavy touch approach is preferred in China since it generally makes it more difficult for a copycat start-up to fully duplicate a service. Having a heavy touch and controlling all aspects of a service can also lead to more data, which is vital to a good AI product. Already, China is sitting on the world’s biggest data goldmine. This is especially true when it comes to Tencent, the company behind WeChat, a certifiable super-app that people use for just about everything. To understand the phenomenon of WeChat, it’s important to understand that most Chinese people are mobile-first internet users, which means that their first internet experience was through a cheap smartphone, rather than a PC. With this in mind, WeChat has become the mobile app that lets you do everything you’d want to do with a PC. Thanks to mini apps within WeChat, you can not just chat with friends, but you can also order food for delivery, unlock a shared bike, buy groceries, buy movie tickets, purchase plane tickets, book a doctor’s appointment, order a prescription, and secure some stocks – all without leaving WeChat. Many of these functions are made possible by another mini app: the WeChat Wallet, which was introduced on Chinese New Year 2014. Every New Year’s Day, there’s a tradition of sending loved ones a red envelope with money inside. WeChat allowed users to do this electronically, with no transaction fees, and it was such a success that upon launch, five million people linked their bank accounts to WeChat and sent 16 million electronic red envelopes. Since the introduction of WeChat Wallet, China has become an increasingly cash-free society. That’s a lot of data under one roof, making it increasingly clear what people like to buy, where they travel and a whole lot more. The arrival of AI in our everyday lives is coming in four waves. The first is internet AI, and it’s already here. YouTube recommends the next video for you to watch based on an AI algorithm, and services like the Toutiao app not only recommends articles, it automatically generates them as well. As for who is the leader in internet AI, the author sees the US and China as neck and neck for now, but in five years, he predicts China will have a 60-40 advantage in terms of being able to dominate the market. This is thanks to China having more internet users than the US and Europe combined, and a population ready to make mobile payments to content creators. Already apps like WeChat Wallet allow people to send micropayments of a few cents to online content creators they like, and this type of environment is going to lead to innovative content from empowered creators – giving China the slight edge. The second wave is business AI, and this is the category where the US really has an advantage. Business AI is already emerging, with algorithms making decisions on financial portfolios and bank loans. China does have some impressive mobile services already, like Smart Finance, which makes loans without taking into account financial history or your zip code. Instead, it uses unique metrics like how long it takes you to answer certain questions and how much battery power your device has. In doing so, it’s proven to be a reliable loan service for migrant workers and other populations underserved by traditional banks, and the percentage of defaults is only in the single digits. However, one area of data China lacks is business records. Compared to China, the US has an impeccable history of record keeping, with databases full of banking, hospital and other business transactions. For this reason, the US is in great position for business AI and the author gives America a 90-10 advantage here. The five-year prediction is slightly better for China, with the US advantage cut to 70-30. The third wave of AI is perception AI, which includes voice and facial recognition programs. China has an advantage here, due in part to cultural differences. Americans have many “Big Brother” fears about their image and voice being captured, while the Chinese are more agreeable to the idea of giving up some privacy in return for more convenience. Perception AI has the potential to be an exciting area as it blurs the boundaries of online and offline. This is why this technology often falls under the category of online-merge-offline (OMO). One OMO application we’ll be seeing more of is the smart grocery store. Imagine grabbing a grocery cart that scans your face, recognizes you and brings up your shopping list. In doing so, it greets you in the voice of your favorite actor. And since it scans everything you put in the cart, it can stop you before you reach the checkout counter if you forgot anything. It could even remind you of your loved one’s favorite brand of wine as you approach that section. China is already making the Xiaomi line of products, which turn your home into a voice-activated, AI-enhanced environment. Due to a local manufacturing hub in Shenzhen, these products, which include speakers, refrigerators, rice cookers and vacuum cleaners, are very affordable. China’s manufacturing advantage and US privacy concerns, give China a 60-40 lead now, and the author expects it will grow to 80-20 in five years’ time. The fourth and final wave is autonomous AI. So far, we haven’t even gotten close to the kind of technology that gives robots human-like intelligence, and it’s possible that we never will. But we do have drones, which are becoming more advanced and machines that can recognize the color of a ripe strawberry and gently pick them. Google and Tesla are also transforming our motorways with driverless cars, which will be rolled out in years to come. So, the US currently has a big lead in autonomous AI, which the author puts at around 90-10, but China is eager to catch up. In fact, the Chinese government is very proactive in issuing AI-friendly policies and regulations, so it will be easier to implement this technology on a wide scale. Already, China is building a highway and an entire city the size of Chicago especially designed for AI vehicles. So in five years’ time, it’ll be closer to a 50-50 split. These days, when economists and researchers debate about what a world with an AI economy looks like, they tend to fall into two camps. Famed geneticist and researcher, Ray Kurzweil, is in the utopia camp. He sees machines as being the supreme tool for humans to enhance our bodies and minds, allowing us to become smarter and live longer. Similarly, AI researcher Demis Hassabis sees AI as the tool that will allow us to finally cure disease and solve problems like global warming. In the dystopia camp, there’s entrepreneur Elon Musk and physicist Stephen Hawking, who think AI’s potential represents a very serious threat to humanity. For example, an AI program could be asked to solve global warming and see wiping out humans as the best option. Opinions differ among economists as well, and much of the debate has stemmed from a 2013 study by Oxford University, which found 47 percent of US jobs to be at risk over the next 20 years due to increasing automation. Of course, most companies will be eager to cut costs and increase profits if they can automate certain tasks. And this brings us to an important difference in the reports that came after the 2013 Oxford study: Most of the automation that AI is currently capable of allows for certain tasks to be automated, but not entire jobs. For example, an automated tax advisor could do certain tasks, like calculate tax returns and check for inconsistencies, but it can’t have nuanced conversations with clients. With the difference between tasks and entire jobs in mind, more reports followed. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), only 9 percent of US jobs were at risk due to automation. In a 2017 report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC), 38 percent of US jobs were at risk, while McKinsey Global said that around 50 percent of tasks worldwide are “already automatable.” This is quite a range, and it’s a big reason why economists remain divided on the issue. The author tends to agree with the PWC report while thinking that the actual number of displaced workers may even be higher. This is because the reports didn’t take into consideration ground-up displacement, which will come from businesses like Smart Finance and Toutiao, which don’t employ any loan officers or editors. So these businesses won’t be adding automation and firing employees, rather they’ll displace loan officers and editors from the ground-up by not offering them a position in the first place. In 2013, the author was diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma. Up to this point, he was something of a workaholic, but that all changed. He realized that so much of the effort put into his career was meaningless now. Facing up to his own mortality, he now understood that being productive wasn’t what made him human – in fact, that was more like being a machine. What made him human was his relationships with his family, friends and those close to him. Thanks to a course of chemotherapy, he’s currently in remission, but the experience changed how he envisioned AI and humans working in harmony. The emergence of AI presents us with an amazing opportunity to hand over much of our unpleasant mechanical tasks to algorithms so that we can focus on the human aspect of our lives – interacting with one another, being part of a community and making the world a better place. However, this would require a fundamental shift in the value we place on certain jobs. Currently, highly-paid jobs are usually ones that generate profit, and these are also the jobs that can often be carried out by AI. Meanwhile, jobs that can’t easily be automated, such as caregivers and personal aides are undervalued and underpaid. Sure enough, this is a booming field in the US with 1.2 million home health aide and personal care jobs to be added within the next ten years. However, these jobs come with an average salary of around $20,000. If we can raise that salary while letting AI generate profit in the corporate sector, we could simultaneously ease the job displacement issue and better care for our communities. There are a lot of ideas for how to cope with displaced workers, like taxing the wealthiest people in order to issue a universal basic income, which would see that everyone received enough money to get by. And while some form of a basic income may be necessary, relying solely on this solution would be a shame. Doing so would be avoiding the opportunity to enact real social change that could benefit the entire world by creating human-centered labor markets not as driven by profit. Instead of focusing entirely on money, maybe we should be more like Bhutan, which looks at “Gross National Happiness” as the real sign of progress. The key message in these blinks: China is poised to become an AI superpower in the AI economy that is expected to be worth $15.7 trillion worldwide. Thanks to a government that is eager to help push new tech businesses forward, a robust manufacturing hub, and a goldmine of personalized data at their fingertips, China has what it needs to start making amazing AI products and applications. While some worry that an AI economy will result in devastating job losses, if we shift our values toward rewarding human-to-human jobs such as caregiving and community-based work, we may emerge as an even better society and improve the world we live in.

Diamandis and Steven Kotler","summary":"We may very well think that dark times are approaching. Many of us ask ourselves: How long will it be before our world collapses under the strain of climate change, overpopulation and dwindling resources? Surely it’s just a matter of time? Abundance argues otherwise. Far from being near to the end, society is on the cusp of a bright and innovative future. Changes in the world of business, technology and economics will transform societies across the globe for the better. In reading this book in blinks, you’ll find exactly what these changes are, some of which are less obvious than others. For example, did you know that the computing power of the average laptop is close to overtaking that of the human brain? Or how access to the internet is making it easier for children in the developing world to get an education? Or how genetically engineered algae can solve the world’s energy crisis? Technological and social innovations such as these will make our society a better place. Together, they will help move us away from the dangers we currently face and towards a bright, optimistic and abundant future. It’s hard to think about the future and not consider the potential dangers of war, terrorism, climate change, economic crises, population explosion and food shortages. Many of these threats seem so imminent that those who didn’t consider them when evaluating their future might be thought of as crazy. In fact, there are underlying influences that tend to push us towards a pessimistic view of the future. The first is the architecture of our brains – principally, the section known as the amygdala. The amygdala is always on alert for threats in our environment and, when triggered, it initiates the fight-or-flight response. This reaction served us well in times when dangers around us were immediate and life-threatening, but is not so well suited to modern society, where threats tend to be more remote and probabilistic – e.g., the economy could nose-dive, there could be a terrorist attack, etc. The second has to do with the kind of information we receive. News and media outlets are aware that positive news doesn’t elicit the same physiological reaction as threatening news, which is why they report true to the old adage “If it bleeds, it leads” in the battle for our attention. And so, we’re constantly bombarded with fearful images and scenarios that feed the amygdala, keeping us in a state of alert and preventing us from viewing the future objectively. But if we look at the statistics, we would see that the industrialized world has never been safer: we’re living longer, wealthier, healthier lives and have massively increased our access to goods, services and information that our ancestors could never have imagined. Just as they were unable to fathom the impact of technological advances such as the internet, we also cannot see what affect future developments will have on our continued progress. The future is brighter than our brains and the media would have us believe. The world is made up of complex systems where changes in one area can have an impact elsewhere. Natural ecosystems are a great example: population changes in one species affect living and survival conditions for others. Although the complexity of some systems may appear to exacerbate the problems we face, it also presents great opportunities. If progress is made in one area, it can create momentum and positive benefits in others. One of the major challenges we face in creating sustainability is the growth of the world’s population. With the current global population of seven billion projected to rise to nine billion by 2050, it’s difficult to imagine how seemingly dwindling resources, such as clean water, will be able to provide for so many more people. This situation gets even more complicated when we consider that mortality rates will drop if we make greater strides in improving healthcare in developing nations, contributing to greater increases in population. But it would be far too simplistic to stop there. After all, there’s a strong correlation between birth and mortality rates. So although there may be short-term increases in the population, improvements in healthcare would actually slow population growth in the long run. When we look at Morocco, we see how quickly this can occur. In 1971, when child mortality rates were high, women had an average of 7.8 children. But, after the country made great strides in healthcare, education and women’s rights, birth rates dropped to as low as 2.7 children. When we also consider that much of the projected population growth is in Africa and Asia, the relationship between improving health outcomes and slowing population growth is much clearer. But this is only one example of the synergy between the various challenges we face in which progress in one area can mean improvements in others. Many people believe that big businesses across the globe exploit the world’s poorest people and exacerbate income inequality, with the people on top enjoying an ever-increasing share of the profits. However, this is increasingly not the case, as big businesses contribute more and more to the fight against global poverty.   One of the ways they are doing so is by developing cheaper products for people at the bottom of the income pyramid. Due to the skewing of income equality across the world, a vastly greater proportion of the population is in this demographic – that’s around four billion people. This constitutes a huge potential market and the opportunity to make a profit, while raising the standard of living for the world’s poorest citizens. Grameenphone, a telecom company in Bangladesh, is a great example of a company employing this type of business model. When the company was launched, mobile phones cost far more than the average annual income, but phones were about to go digital, meaning that prices were set to drop dramatically over time. By 2006, Bangladesh had sixty million cellphone users who added $650 million to the country’s GDP. Grameenphone had also invested $1.6 billion in network infrastructure, meaning that the money made in Bangladesh stayed there. A second way that big businesses can contribute is through philanthropy. The high-tech revolution created a new breed of technophilanthropists, who, in comparison to earlier philanthropists, are younger, have a much more global vision, and have the business and political connections to really get things moving. There are numerous examples, but the most prominent is Bill Gates, founder of the Gates Foundation, which aims to improve healthcare and fight extreme poverty. Gates has already donated $28 billion to the foundation and, in 2010, he launched the Giving Pledge with Warren Buffett, encouraging fellow billionaires to donate half of their wealth to philanthropic causes within their lifetimes. Access to education is a major global problem. We’re millions of teachers short and lack infrastructure – and where it does exist, it’s falling into disrepair. Students fortunate enough to have access to education are following seriously outdated frameworks. Business leaders agree that the educational system is not providing students with the skills needed to tackle the problems of the twenty-first century, particularly in areas such as critical thinking, creativity and problem solving. Our current education system was formed during the industrial revolution, which not only influenced which subjects were taught, but how to teach. Industry required students to follow orders and fit in like cogs in a machine, so standardization through rote learning was the order of the day and conformity the desired goal. Society has since moved on, but education has not kept pace with these changes. When we consider these problems, it seems education is in need of a serious re-think, but is it feasible with such thinly stretched resources? Fortunately, there is evidence to suggest that increased use and access to ICT may offer a solution which can address both issues of quality and delivery. Sugata Mitra was concerned about educational access while running experiments on self-directed learning in Indian slums. He found that, just by providing a computer terminal and internet access, groups of young children could teach themselves and complete tasks without any previous experience or instructions. Such evidence for self-directed learning is backed by the popularity of online learning platforms, such as the Khan Academy, where anyone can learn anything from basic math to quantum mechanics. This trend could be bolstered with educational video games, which have been shown to help students be highly motivated to take complex problems and find creative solutions. Further development in such technologies, combined with a widespread push to increase access to the internet and online technology, may offer a cost-effective solution and provide individuals with a first-class, personalized education that delivers the skills today’s society needs. We are generally uncomfortable with the word failure. There’s a certain stigma attached to it and, because of this, many people go out of their way to avoid it – even if it means not attempting something new. However, failure should not be viewed as the endpoint, but more as part of a longer learning curve and a vital stepping stone towards innovation. In this respect, Apple’s early attempt to introduce a personal digital assistant called the Newton is a revealing example. Commercially speaking, it was a disaster. Development costs were very high and sales were disappointing, but the story doesn’t end there. Much of the development work on the Newton went into creating a handwriting recognition system, which became the foundation for the hugely successful iPhone. Companies are becoming increasingly aware of the potential benefits of failure, and many of them have developed techniques to make failure more acceptable in order to encourage innovation. Tata, for example, literally celebrates failure by giving an annual award for the best failed idea that taught the company a valuable lesson. Of course, the key ingredient here isn’t failure itself, but the freedom to innovate and learn from our mistakes. Incentive prizes are a great example – because restrictions encourage innovation rather than constrain it. The prize itself is usually not enough to interest the big players in the industry, so smaller teams on restricted funding are attracted to compete. These restrictions force the teams to innovate and find cheaper solutions to problems. With this in mind, the Entrepreneurship Center of MIT developed the 5 x 5 x 5 Rapid Innovation method: five teams of five employees work together for five days to develop five different “business experiments” that will cost no more than €5,000 and can be run within a five-week period. These limits force the teams to innovate and try new things. As the author suggests, it’s not so much about thinking outside the box as in the right-sized box. Back in 1965, before the advent of home computing, Gordon Moore, an employee of Fairchild Semiconductor, made a bold prediction about the future of the computer industry. He predicted that the number of transistors on a computer chip, and therefore the processing speed, would continue to double every two years for the next ten years. Moore went on to become a co-founder of Intel, and his prediction wasn’t just right for the next ten years, but remains relevant today, and has since become known as Moore’s law. Consider that today’s low-end laptops can perform around 10 to 11 (1011) calculations per second and the human brain is estimated to perform 10 to 16 (1016) calculations per second. So, if computer processors continue to progress in line with Moore’s law, the average laptop will surpass the speed of the human brain in the next fifteen years. This exponential increase in processing speed will have tremendous implications, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. But, while we’ve managed to develop technology in step with the law to date, there is skepticism that we can continue to do so due to the limitations of the technology. One of the main arguments is the fact that electrical signals require the movement of electrons, which generates heat. And this build-up of heat in microchips is seen as a barrier to achieving much greater processing speeds. Clearly unfazed by such skepticism, the industry continues to progress and innovate. IBM has recently developed microchips that run on light, removing the potential limitations of electron-based chips. They predict that this technology will increase the speed of supercomputers a thousand-fold over the next eight years. With such breakthroughs and continued progress, it seems to be a question of when the average laptop will calculate faster than the human brain – not whether it will. From Star Wars to 2001: A Space Odyssey, many a science fiction film has envisioned an age where robots live among us in society, helping or hindering us – depending on the plot, of course. Technology programs have seduced us with the idea of robots helping us around the house but still these promises hardly seem to have been realized today – self-operating vacuum cleaners aside. Now, however, there are good reasons to believe that the wait for intelligent robots may be coming to an end. Although Moore’s law specifically deals with the increasing performance of computer chips, other essential components are experiencing similar exponential increases in performance with simultaneous drops in price. And as these components are pressed into action and mass produced, prices plummet even deeper. Three-dimensional laser range finders, for instance, are a key element in allowing a robot to navigate a cluttered room. While they used to cost $5,000 dollars per unit, recent advances in the technology and an increase in their popularity due to their use in X-box Kinect devices has seen that price drop to $150 per unit. The availability of such advanced hardware is being complemented by huge strides in artificial intelligence. We’re currently developing robots that can recognize individual people and react to movements and facial expressions with appropriate emotional responses. Industry experts already envisage such robots providing care for an increasingly aging population. Although we may not have the singing, dancing humanoid robots of science fiction just yet, robots of different forms have already been produced to augment services in a number of areas. And, as the technology advances and the price of the components continues to fall, robots are set to take on an increasing role in society and our lives. After witnessing the horrific problems created by the lack of access to clean water in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, Michael Pritchard, an English engineer and expert in water treatment, was motivated to do something about it. He set about creating a simple and portable solution and, just a few years later, in 2009 he created the simple design of the Lifesaver water bottle. Lifesaver certainly doesn’t look high-tech, with a hand-pump on one end and a filter on the other. However, Pritchard realized early on in the design stage that conventional filters were able to  capture most bacteria but not viruses, which are far more microscopic, so he decided to look to nanotechnology. Nanotechnology involves building things on an atomic scale. Using atoms as building blocks makes it possible to create unique materials, called nanocomposites, and even tiny programmable assemblers, called nanomachines. These nanomachines can self-replicate and build other nanomaterials, creating greater efficiency in the technology and allowing for fantastic innovation potential. This technology has allowed us to create materials with interesting properties. For instance, nanocomposites that are considerably stronger than steel and can be produced at a fraction of the cost. Nanoscale components are also being used to improve the efficiency of energy technologies, particularly in solar cells. In the case of the Lifesaver, nanotechnology allowed Pritchard to create a much finer filter that removes everything there is to remove. This filter makes the water safe to drink without the need for expensive chemical- or energy-intensive methods. Far from limited to improving filters, nanotechnology has the potential to boost progress in any number of areas. As a relatively new technology, we’ve only just begun to realize its potential. Imagine you’ve just broken your last coffee cup. You could run to the store and buy a new one or order one online and wait for it to be delivered. But let’s imagine that, instead, you could browse designs online, download whatever cup design you like, hit “print” and a desktop device manufactures the item for you in minutes. Far from science fiction, the above scenario is already possible. The device is a 3D printer, which can fabricate an object of any shape by laying down successive layers of material, one on top of the next. Recent advances in the technology have made it possible for current models to print in an exceptional range of materials, such as plastic, glass, steel and even titanium, and also print combinations of materials in intricate patterns, creating materials with interesting functional properties. But 3D printing is not limited to producing objects: it’s also making waves in medical fields, where cells and tissue can now be printed. Early applications have included printing skin tissue, such as ears, for use in cosmetic surgery, but further research into printing complex organs, such as replacement kidneys for transplants, is underway. While the innovative potential of 3D printing is creating a lot of excitement, the approaching affordability and availability of the technology to the home user may be the bigger game changer. Being able to produce and modify your own products whenever you need them minimizes the need for large-scale production of many goods on the market, creating resource savings through reductions in waste and shipping. Despite this technology being in its infancy, we are already seeing the potential for 3D printing to revolutionize the way we think about and create items and the potential for further innovation grows as the range of applications expands. Although biotechnological applications in food have created much controversy in recent years, the science itself is nothing new. The 12,000-year history of farming is characterized by farmers manipulating living systems, creating new strains of crops through cross-pollination and manipulating the plants’ DNA. Technology may have moved on, but the principle of manipulating organisms remains the same. Today, advances in genetic engineering provide solutions that are proving to be a key weapon in the fight to feed an ever increasing population. One of many examples is the Gates Foundation, which is helping to develop BioCassava Plus, a root vegetable fortified with vitamins and engineered to be more pest-resistant and longer-lasting. By 2020, this single crop could improve the health of 250 million people for whom it is a daily meal. However, the applications of biotechnology are not limited to food production. Craig Venter, famed for his project to sequence the human genome, is currently working to develop strains of algae as a biofuel source. Using algae is extremely beneficial as it doesn’t require arable land, can be grown in saltwater and is also capable of absorbing carbon from nearby power stations. If Venter hits his target, he will be able to produce 10,000 gallons of biofuel per acre, no small feat when compared to the 18 gallons produced by corn. Such innovative examples may be just the tip of the iceberg as reductions in price and increased availability of technology puts them within the grasp of willing amateurs. This is already bearing fruit: shortly after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a group of students from the Delft University of Technology,  created “Alkanivore,” a bug able to consume oil spills. As the preserve of large organizations, biotechnology is already providing key advances, but easier access to the technology is multiplying the potential to find innovative solutions to food, energy and other global problems. When Colombian computer engineer Oscar Morales created a Facebook group one morning in 2008, he could never have imagined the eventual consequences. Morales created the group to make a stand against the terrorism and kidnapping by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC. By the end of the week, the group had one hundred thousand members and, as the numbers grew, this virtual protest turned into a real one. A month later, twelve million people were out in the streets protesting in two hundred cities, leading to a massive wave of demilitarization, with soldiers leaving the FARC. As the Arab Spring has shown, the spread of the internet and social media has helped people share and discuss societal problems, while providing tools to organize and fight oppression. An Egyptian protester summed this up in the following tweet: “We use Facebook to schedule protests, Twitter to coordinate, and Youtube to tell the world.”   Access to information has proven to be the major catalyst in this process and we have never had so many people with access to so much information. Just consider that a Masai warrior with a smartphone currently has access to more information than the US president had fifteen years ago. Despite this fact, it’s easy to forget that a significant portion of the world’s population does not yet have access to the internet. It’s estimated that three billion people are set to get online by the year 2020. Imagine the impact of people from all social statuses joining the global conversation, sharing their ideas and opinions. The spread of global connectivity is already helping to solve societal problems across the globe. As it continues to grow, we could well see an increase in popular protests, started by people like Oscar Morales. If we want to talk about abundance in terms of energy sources, then we don’t really need to look much further than the sun. It’s estimated that the solar power in the deserts of North Africa is enough to supply forty times the world’s current usage. With so much energy available from one source, why are we not capturing more of it? Many of the areas where solar power is most readily available do not have the money, industry or political stability to create the infrastructure to capitalize on this bounty. The price and relative lack of efficiency of first-generation solar cells was surely a big factor in the lack of take-up. Since then, huge strides have been made in improving the efficiency of solar power through the use of thinner layers of silicon, of nanotechnology to concentrate the solar energy and of smarter capturing systems that follow the sun. As advances in efficiency encourage greater acceptance, larger scale production allows for increased affordability, creating a virtuous cycle. Solar prices are estimated to be dropping by 6 percent, and capacity growing by 30 percent annually. Despite this continuing trend, the age of solar panels covering rooftops may only be a fleeting one, as advances have meant that we can now create much smaller, yet increasingly efficient cells. In fact, we may not need rooftop panels at all. New Energy Technologies has recently found a way to turn an ordinary window into a solar panel by using the world’s smallest organic solar cell. They are not only far smaller, but also perform ten times better than today’s commercial models. All these innovative trends encourage greater acceptance of the technology, which in turn helps to create further efficiencies through mass production, reducing the prices even more. As the proportion of the population living in cities continues to increase and the amount of land suitable for growing crops decreases, the distance we ship food continues to climb. In the US, for example, the average distance foodstuffs travel is 1,500 miles, but a meal of different ingredients could easily be five times that amount. In a world of scarce resources, this kind of practice seems unsustainable, but it’s hard to resolve as we move further away from where our food is grown. Although on a much smaller scale, the US military faced a similar problem in feeding their troops in the Middle East. Due to the terrain and location, they couldn’t ship fresh food in and were forced to develop methods for producing crops without access to fertile soil. As a result, they developed hydroponics, a system of growing plants suspended in a nutrient-rich fluid. Later developments brought about greater efficiencies with aeroponics, where plants and crops are fed through gases in the surrounding environment. These methods not only removed the dependence on fertile soil, but also greatly reduced the amount of fresh water required. Agriculture currently accounts for approximately 70 percent of the fresh water we use; aeroponics would need just six percent. Implementation of such growing systems reduces the need for arable land, which creates the possibility of urban or vertical farming. We could build inner-city, purpose-built structures or adapt old multi-story buildings, which would virtually eliminate transport distances and free up vast areas of land. Such urban farms, aside from providing plant crops, could also incorporate systems of aquaculture, meaning that fish and seafood could be farmed in cities. This would not only give over-fished seafood stocks a much needed recovery break, but also provide nutrients for the plants. By employing such methods in or around population centers, we could eliminate or greatly reduce many of the current system’s resource inefficiencies. Optimizing production and capturing techniques is only one side of the coin in the battle towards efficient management of the world’s resources. We also need to ensure that delivery systems of resources and products are efficient in order to minimize waste. Take water, for example: an estimated 20 percent of fresh water is lost through contamination or leaks in the network of pipes that delivers the water to taps. Such a high percentage of waste is alarming with such a vital resource, but this doesn’t have to be the case. “Smart-pipes” using nanotechnology have been developed by Chicago’s Northwestern University with nanosensors that measure everything from water quality to water flow. By connecting the sensors to a network, most likely the internet, we can develop smart distribution systems. Further high-tech solutions are on the horizon with the possibility of pipes that not only know when they’ve sprung a leak, but can repair themselves when it happens. Today, sensors such as these have become so much cheaper and more readily available that we can employ them in a variety of areas to monitor pretty much anything. These technologies have the potential to improve the efficiency of delivering virtually everything, not just water. Having sensors in goods, products and household items also creates the potential for all kinds of efficient automation. For example, your house could identify when you’re running low on essential items and order them for you. But domestic uses are dwarfed by the potential business uses, where raw material orders could be programmed to match demand and streamline supply chains, minimizing waste to an extraordinary degree. The technology to create smarter delivery and distribution systems is available and if we invest in creating goods more efficiently, minimizing the waste of resources will be part of this efficiency drive. The main message of this book is: Abundance provides a breathtaking tour of key technologies and the implications of their projected exponential growth, giving us a glimpse of how they may develop and discussing the ways in which this will impact society. From the potential role of robots and artificial intelligence in improving healthcare to the uses of nanotechnology and digital manufacturing in reducing waste and conserving natural resources, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic that the future is not just bright, but may well be one of abundance.

Maybe that’s because we are currently living in one of the most dynamic periods that human civilization has experienced in the past 500 years. The last of these eras of great economic and cultural expansion was the original Renaissance, which lasted from 1450 to 1550. It was a time of great discoveries and accomplishments, ranging from the development of the printing press to new forms of art that culminated in the masterpieces of Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci. Similar phenomena are happening today, from the development of international trade and exchange at an unprecedented level to the effect of the internet and new media on the exchange of information. In these blinks, you’ll learn how computer chips are changing the world we live in; that you know even more people on Facebook than you think; and why periods of progress are also periods of instability causing radicalism and violence. Just about everyone has heard of Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo. These famous artists created some of history’s most iconic masterpieces, and millions stand in line every year to see their work, which are landmarks of the incredible achievements of the Renaissance. But what exactly was the Renaissance? It was a period from about 1450 to 1550 during which supreme achievements of scientific and artistic genius were made. But it also had a dark side. The term Renaissance itself is controversial as it suggests something that is universally good. But in reality, the idea of “Renaissance Europe” was crafted by nineteenth-century European historians as a way to fortify the standing of European nations. This concept of European cultural superiority was then used to justify nineteenth-century European imperialism and colonialism across the globe. Despite the innovations made during this period by the likes of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, theologian Martin Luther and explorer Christopher Columbus, the Renaissance was also a time of great destruction and suffering. Diseases like smallpox were spread across oceans, practically exterminating the Aztecs, Incas and other Native Americans. Just like the Renaissance of the fifteenth century, our current New Renaissance has also been a time of great growth. The New Renaissance could be said to have started in 1990 with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. Commercial internet service began, and China stepped back into the world economy. The world suddenly felt very different, and historical data backs up that sensation. For example, the World Trade Organization or WTO, formed in 1995, is a powerful symbol of international economic advancement, cooperation and a radically different historical period. Today it numbers 161 members, representing every major economy in the world. However, just like the Renaissance of centuries past, this progress comes with a hefty bill. Just consider the catastrophic toll 30 years of unprecedented growth have had on the environment. Our world is practically unrecognizable from the one that existed a mere 25 years ago. Politics, the economy and society have all dramatically transformed, opening up stunning parallels between this modern transformation and the one that took place in the fifteenth century. For instance, centuries ago, the printing press revolutionized communication over the period of just a single lifetime. It began around 1450 when the German entrepreneur Johann Gutenberg (1395–1468) invented movable type. He used it to make the world’s first major printed book, Gutenberg’s Bible. Because of this breakthrough, a person born in the 1450s could look back on her fiftieth birthday to see that 15 to 20 million books had been printed during her lifetime. This number easily surpassed the number of books written since ancient Roman times by all European scribes combined. This hypothetical person would even have a difficult time remembering a world without books, although the generation before had relied solely on face-to-face conversations and handwritten manuscripts for communication. Similarly, the internet has transformed at an incredible speed the way people today interact with one another and the world. Since 1988, when the first intercontinental fiber-optic cables were installed, the number of users connected through this infrastructure has grown more than seven-fold. In 2000 it was 400 million; in 2005, it was one billion, and by 2015 it had reached three billion. The internet age marked easily the fastest mass adoption of a technology in the whole of human history, and one that radically connected all of humanity. Just think about it this way: if Facebook were a country, it would have a population of 1.5 billion, making it the largest nation on Earth. What’s more remarkable is the fact that two average users on this social network are less than four degrees of separation apart. Most people on Facebook know someone who knows someone who knows one of their friends. You can’t read the news today without getting a seriously dreary picture of the world. But is it really all doom and gloom? Actually, today, the quality of global health and wealth are at their highest level ever, even for the most disadvantaged populations on earth. Life expectancy has risen by almost two decades since 1960, climbing from 52 to 71 years. To put that in perspective, the last 20-year improvement in this metric took 1,000 years to achieve, not 50. As a result, a baby born today in practically any country can expect to live longer than at any previous point in that country’s history. Crushing poverty has also seen a dramatic improvement over the last 25 years. In 1990, something like two billion people were living below the World Bank’s international poverty line; by 2015, although the human population had grown by two billion, the total number of people living in extreme poverty on less than $1.25 per day had dropped by over half to just 900 million. This progress is the result of interconnected economies and improved medical care. The expansion of trade and the jobs it has created have helped raise the incomes of poor people. Competition has increased, which has, in turn, lowered the prices of goods and services while boosting their quality. As a result, small businesses and households on a budget have been empowered. During this time, technological advancements and better practices in public sanitation, clean water, hygiene, pest control, vaccines and drugs – along with growing public budgets to support them – have helped combat disease. In 1990, 13 million children under the age of five died from infectious diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, only 5.9 million children died from the same infections. The incredible accomplishments realized during the first Renaissance makes it seem like a magnificent cornucopia of progress. But we now know that wasn’t the case. In fact, there were clear signs that the progress attained during this period had disparate outcomes. While average welfare rose during much of the period, the wealth gap between rich and poor grew dramatically. Exact data from the first Renaissance is a bit patchy, but all the information that’s available points to a rise in income inequality alongside the expansion of manufacturing and trade. By 1550, in practically every Western European town of any decent size, the top 5 to 10 percent of residents owned between 40 and 50 percent of the town’s total wealth, while the bottom half owned little more than their own labor power. This phenomenon was primarily precipitated by falling wages on the lower half of the income scale. Such cuts were felt particularly acutely by women. Between 1480 and 1562, a nanny’s wages did not increase at all, yet the cost of her daily necessities rose by 150 percent. Outside Europe, matters were far worse. Some 150,000 Africans were enslaved between 1450 and 1550, and the European Age of Discovery meant the total destruction of entire civilizations in the Americas. Unsurprisingly, a polarity between rich and poor is also central to our current Renaissance. While average global welfare is rising, the extremes have grown even more distant. In 2010, the 388 richest people in the world controlled more wealth than the poorest 50 percent of the population. By 2015, this number dropped dramatically as just 62 people controlled more wealth than the bottom half. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent of society – some 3.6 billion people globally – subsist on an average of just a few dollars per day. In 1495, Italians began to experience horrific symptoms caused by a mystery disease. The victims of this ailment spat up blood and suffered from boils the size of breakfast rolls, which oozed dark green pus. The disease left people sick for months and sometimes years. What was it? Well, disease spread rampantly during the Renaissance, and we now know this particular affliction as syphilis. Within four years of its emergence, this sexually transmitted disease had spread all over Europe and was a global menace a mere five years later. The deadly advance of syphilis was facilitated by populations concentrated in urban centers. This urbanization created mutual interdependence, which did wonders for creativity and cultural exchange but also produced ideal conditions for the spread of disease. Given the similarities between then and now, you might have guessed that the modern world’s concentrated yet fluid populations produce comparable risks, not just for health, but also in other aspects of life. The massive rise in air travel neatly mimics the population exchange and economic linkages that enabled syphilis to spread throughout Europe and across the sea. A good example is the Ebola epidemic that broke out in December 2013 in West Africa. By March 2014, it had claimed 60 lives in Liberia and Sierra Leone; by mid-2015, over 28,000 cases had been reported, along with 11,300 deaths. And this was no accident. Such massive pitfalls appear regularly as side-effects of positive phenomena like rising global financial investments and the construction of the incredible infrastructure behind the internet. In fact, the interconnectivity of the modern world means that when something happens far away, it’s likely to rapidly become a problem at home. Just consider the 2008 financial crisis, which began in the United States but swiftly became a global issue. Or take cyber attacks: these data crimes can be committed anywhere in the world and prey on anybody, anywhere. As the world of the first Renaissance evolved at an astonishing rate, people often experienced fear, doubt and insecurities. This climate proved fertile ground for radical messages proclaiming doom and a need for extreme action. Just take Girolamo Savonarola, a Dominican friar who, in 1497, incited his fanatical followers to gather every piece of evidence they could find of their strange new age. They hunted out immoral books, nude paintings and sculptures, indecent perfumes, heretical texts and exotic musical instruments. They piled everything up in Florence’s central piazza and set it ablaze in what has become known as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Within a year of this spectacle, the friar became the most powerful figure in Florentine politics by launching a public campaign of moral purification that called for draconian laws prohibiting vice. His rapid ascent to power was mostly a product of good timing. After all, he was preaching his apocalyptic message as the year 1500 drew near – a year many Christians believed would bring the Last Judgment. Today radical messages of hate and extremism also pose a threat. Just take the rise of Islamic State, fringe Christian denominations that preach Islamophobia and homophobia, Orthodox Israeli Jews who assault gay people at pride parades and conceive plots to bomb Arab girls’ schools and, of course, the resurgence of neo-Nazi groups. All of these hate groups are examples of what can happen in a rapidly changing world marked by deepening inequality and general disorientation. So, the Renaissance wasn’t all great back then and it’s not all great now. But does that mean the future is bleak? As you’ll find out in the next blink, we have good reason to think the opposite. This comparison of ugly histories and current situations can be a bit frightening, but it’s essential to understand that even at times when the world as we know it might vanish down the drain, there’s still potential for tremendous good. Despite all the worrying developments, there’s also great progress being made today. While extremism and fear make it easy to be skeptical about the role of scientific and artistic advances in transforming the world, there’s good reason to believe in them. However, it’s difficult to measure this type of progress as the gains produced by acts of genius are often unquantifiable. The strength of innovations in the creation of wealth, health, art and justice is hard to measure in numbers. However, new technologies are still dramatically transforming the way we understand the world. Just remember, a mere 20 years ago, we thought Earth-like planets were rare. Today, because of better telescopes, computers and the thousands of astronomers who are linked together through the internet, we know that the Milky Way alone holds at least 10 billion other planets that are of the appropriate size, temperature and orbit to support life. This discovery has upgraded the possibility of alien life from remote to virtually certain. Or consider other intangible goods like those in the digital realm. If one million copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica were sold for $1,000 each, it would add $1 billion to GDP. Contrast that with the fact that when one million users log on to Wikipedia, no money is produced – although immeasurable good is still provided. Thanks to phenomena like Wikipedia, humanity is much better off in terms of time and money saved, even though GDP isn’t directly affected. And just about anyone can attest to the tremendous wealth of education and entertainment that can be gleaned from the internet without spending a penny. The key message in this book: The first Renaissance was a period of tremendous creativity and innovation, but also one of profound destruction and suffering. Today’s world is in many ways similar to the Renaissance of 500 years ago, and a historical perspective can shine a light on its intricacies.  Got feedback?

Today, thanks to digital devices we’re living fully networked lives; we’re available to chat, answer email or work around the clock. At the same time there’s also been an evolution in robotics, so that robots not only take on difficult or dangerous jobs for us but also care for us – and even have demands of their own. These blinks explore these two strands of today’s digital culture by looking into how technology both enhances our everyday experiences and changes the way we relate to each other – not necessarily for the better. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how a seal-like robot has been designed to take care of the elderly; why many girls use “shrinking” software on profile pictures to appear thinner; and how being constantly available online actually makes us anxious. Have you ever wondered who'll take care of your parents as they get older? You? Your siblings? Someone else? Well, many people believe that robots will eventually become our caretakers. In some places like Japan, they may even be a necessity. Some 25 years ago, Japanese demographers concluded that Japan wouldn’t have enough young people to take care of the elderly in the future. So they began developing a robot called Wandakun that would be able to help. Wandakun is a fuzzy koala that purrs, sings and speaks a few phrases when it's touched. It can serve as a companion to the elderly. Speaking about Wandakun, one 74-year-old man said, “I fell in love after years of being quite lonely...I swore to protect and care for the little animal.” For many people, robots have changed the very notion of “care.” We used to think “care” meant caring about someone, but now it often means taking care of someone – something a robot may be able to do. In 2005, the International Symposium for Contemplative Studies discussed the potential uses of caregiving robots. Speaking of a machine that cuts people's toenails, one attendee said, “That is a caring computer. Or [one that] talks with you if you are lonely. Same thing.” Some people don't think there's an important difference between a real person and a robot performing caregiving tasks. They're both taking care, which is enough. Miriam, a 72-year-old who lives in a nursing home, is quite fond of her seal-like robot Paro, with whom she talks and shares secrets. In the end, Paro doesn't and can't truly care about her, but the nursing staff and scientists who created Paro don't think this is a problem. It's not only the elderly and their caretakers who've started using robots as companions. A wider audience is also beginning to accept them. Why? One reason is that we start to forget that robots are machines when they start asking us for care. Tamagotchi, a widely popular digital toy in the 1990s, illustrates this phenomenon. Tamagotchis were rather unsophisticated devices, with small screens that displayed an animal-like creature with basic needs, such as eating and sleeping. They needed to be “taken care of” continuously. Children fed and bathed them, and became quite attached to them. Many children believed their feelings for their Tamagotchis were reciprocated. One nine-year-old said of her “deceased” Tamagotchi, “She was loved; she loved back.” As robots become more lifelike, our ethical understanding of them will also change. One researcher developed a test to measure how “real” an inanimate object has to be before people feel uncomfortable when it's hurt. For the study, participants were asked to hold three creatures upside-down: a Barbie doll, a Furby (Furbies are bird-like robots that say, “me scared,” when held upside down) and a living rodent. Participants gave the rodent a wide berth and didn’t dare turn it upside-down, whereas they didn't mind handling the Barbie roughly. They felt fine doing things like slinging the doll around by its hair. The Furby, however, presented an interesting case; when the Furby expressed discomfort, most participants felt guilty after 30 seconds or so and turned it back over. So when robots feel or act more real, many of us can experience an ethical dilemma when asked to “hurt” them. We've seen that certain robots can seem “real” enough that we are compelled to consider what they “need.” And for some people, robots are real enough to become actual social companions as well, fulfilling our social needs. Tim, a 53-year-old man, felt guilty about putting his mother in a nursing home, even though he visits her several times a week. He says he “used to hate to leave her in that room.” Yet Paro, the seal-like robot that is sensitive to touch and can actually understand a few words, has made him feel much better about his mother's social interactions. “She puts it in her lap,” he says. “She talks to it. It's...less depressing.” Even though Paro isn't alive, Tim feels his mother is “less alone” now that she has the robot. And certain robots are more than just “real enough” – some people actually prefer robots to live companions. For example, you don't have the same responsibilities with a robot that you would with an animal. Robotic pets don't need as much attention as live ones; they don't make waste, and they can't do as much damage to property. Yolanda, an 11-year-old girl who plays with a robot dog called AIBO, learned this. She initially thought AIBO would be a good alternative for kids who can't have a real pet, but has since decided AIBO might even be better. “You can turn [it] off,” she said, “and it won't bug you.” So robots aren't just replacements for our traditional companions; some see robots as better than human or animal companions, too. Robots have become an integral part of our culture, and, in the future, may become more and more like humans. Yet what sort of effects will these lifelike robots have on us? Well, it’s possible that we'll become more attached to them. Older people with few friends or companions are particularly susceptible to this, becoming enchanted by robots quite quickly. Consider the story of Andy, a 76-year-old living in a nursing home, who was struggling to make new friends as he missed his family and ex-wife. He was given a baby robot, called My Real Baby. He began to interact with it as if it was alive, and even named it after his ex-wife. He now uses the doll to remember the good times he spent with her. He also uses the doll to discuss his divorce. For people like Andy, bonding with a robot can provide great psychological relief. It can also be easier than bonding with real people, and perhaps even more cathartic. Our increasing attachment to robots has consequences, however. Children are especially likely to be hurt, for example, if a robot breaks down or malfunctions. The author observed this in the interaction between a 12-year-old girl named Estelle and her robot, Kismet. As a human-like robot, Kismet is gentle and soft-spoken, with big eyes and lifelike features. Yet when it suffered a glitch while Estelle was playing with it, she thought that she had somehow done something wrong. As a result, Estelle felt that Kismet didn't like her, that the robot was, in response to her actions, acting “sullen” (when actually, it had just malfunctioned). When children grow attached to robots that are more lifelike than not, they could get their feelings hurt if something goes technically awry. Are relationships with robots always positive? Or perhaps we should ask, are human relationships always positive? Interestingly, certain people may be prone to neglect their human relationships in favor of robotic ones. Some people may become so involved with their robots that they forget the people around them. Edna, an 82-year-old who cares for a My Real Baby robot, has been known to neglect her granddaughter Gail when the robot is also present. When Edna and Gail are alone, Edna can focus on her granddaughter; but when the robot arrives, Edna will divert her attention to the “baby.” Edna can become so engaged with her robot that she basically ignores Gail's pleas for attention. Yet some people may even want to replace their human relationships with robotic ones. Wesley, a 64-year-old who's been divorced three times, is one example. He believes he always ends up hurting others as he's self-centered, yet with a robot, this wouldn’t be an issue. A robot thus provides needed social interaction, without the risks. Wesley even thinks a robot can provide more for him than a real woman could, because he doesn't have to consider the robot’s moods or emotions. He also finds it burdensome when real people grow attached to him, because he fears hurting them. A robot well suited to Wesley’s interests is now being developed, called Roxxxy – the first “sex robot.” Roxxxy can't move, but she has warm skin and a pulse. She can talk, and what’s more, an owner can even choose from a host of different personalities for her. Sex robots were originally intended to be a “better than nothing” solution, but for people like Wesley, they may be better than anything else. These days, people – especially teenagers – are spending more and more time on the internet, creating and building their online “identity.” Developmental psychologist Erik Erikson said that identity play, a term that describes when people experiment with who they are, is an important part of adolescence. Today, there are all sorts of new opportunities for identity play, thanks to technology. People can create avatars, which are a graphical representation of a person’s alter ego or character, in video games or virtual-reality environments. They can then use the avatar to explore or “try on” different personalities. More generally, social media sites offer another platform for identity play. Mona, a teenager, is always updating her Facebook profile, as she fears she doesn't appear interesting enough. Her friend Helen faces similar challenges, and has asked herself, “Who should I friend online? I really want to only have my cool friends listed, but I'm nice to a lot of other kids at school.” Adolescents like Mona and Helen make their decisions on Facebook very carefully. They experiment with their real identities by shaping and reshaping what they reveal and don’t reveal about themselves online. Of course, maintaining an online identity can be stressful, as many people worry about how their image comes across to others. Many girls now use “shrinking” software on their profile pictures to make them appear thinner. Boys are also affected. Brad spends a lot of time perfecting his “cool” online persona. He feels he has to conceal parts of his personality, however, such as his love for Harry Potter, because it's “uncool.” Brad is afraid that if he doesn't write out all his interests and positive attributes, he won't seem “cool,” but if he brags too much, he'll appear vain. Feelings like this are a normal part of adolescence, but young people are now experiencing adolescence on a broader, more public stage than ever before. This can add extra stress, because any mistake they make is recorded for everyone to see. Did you spend hours talking on the phone with friends as an adolescent? Today teens are more likely to text and message each other constantly, instead of calling. Even adults tend to use the phone less, partly as they think phone calls now are too demanding. Randolph, an architect, says, “Now that there is e-mail, people expect that a call will be more complicated...People expect it to take time, or else you wouldn't have called.” Tara, a lawyer, also thinks phone calls must be urgent, or else you “would have sent an e-mail.” Granted, instant messaging and e-mail can be more convenient for scheduling appointments, for example. Leonora, a chemistry professor, schedules all her appointments via e-mail, sometimes months in advance. She's too busy to do it otherwise, and she's also noticed that her friends prefer this too. Teenagers especially like to text often during the day, considering this sort of communication easy and convenient. Seventeen-year-old Elaine says she sends each of her six best friends at least 20 messages a day. She also sends an additional 40 instant messages from her computer. She thinks texting is easier, because “when you can think about what you're going to say, you can talk to someone you'd have trouble talking to [otherwise].” So people are calling each other less, but many of us are still expected to be available at all times – thanks to our phones. Can you remember the last time you intentionally went somewhere without your phone? When you do leave your phone behind, accidentally or intentionally, it may make you nervous. These days, we’re expected to be reachable at a moment’s notice, at all times of the day. A phone has become a necessary social item for many teenagers; yet aside from the benefits of texting friends dozens of times a day, a phone can also keep a troubled teen in touch with parents. Often, this is exactly why parents give their children a phone in the first place: to stay connected in a crisis. Julia vividly remembers when she was eight and living in New York City during the terrorist attacks of 9/11. She and her classmates were taken to the school’s basement, and kept there for hours just to be safe. Recalling the event, Julia feels that a phone would've helped her a lot, because being able to speak with her mother would've made the situation more bearable. In an emergency like 9/11, a phone can be an enormous help, but our phones also can cause us stress. We can't ever be truly alone, or have private time to ourselves. Hope, a real estate broker, often goes hiking in the woods and takes her BlackBerry smartphone with her. Her husband calls her every 30 minutes to stay in touch, and she keeps answering her phone until she loses reception. She feels relief, however, when she’s out of cell range, saying, “Thank goodness. I need a rest.” Being constantly available can be quite a burden, especially when you're trying to relax in nature! Sharing ideas and meeting people online can be a positive experience. But be wary, as online identities shouldn't take over your real life. Often when a person is having a hard time in real life, turning to the internet is a relief, a chance to live another life in a digital skin, with an online persona. A shy person, for instance, might experiment with being more outgoing online. Young people can also practice flirting without the pressure of actually seeing the object of their attentions. For some people, this can be life-changing, as it was for one young woman with a prosthetic leg. She lost her leg in a car crash, and afterward, it was hard for her to resume a normal life, or have sexual relations. So she created an online avatar, a character that also had a prosthetic leg, and used this new persona to practice talking about her situation in virtual relationships. This helped her grow more comfortable with herself, and through this, she learned to accept her new body. Unfortunately, having an online life isn't always positive. Some people's online lives take over their offline realities. This happened to Adam, a 43-year-old who struggles with his addiction to online games. He works two jobs, but feels them “slipping away” under the pressure of his gaming, as he plays up to 15 hours a day. He wants to cut back, but says he can only feel relaxed and happy when he's playing. He has little social contact outside of his games, and isn’t working toward any personal or professional goals. People like Adam can become so engrossed in their online identities they forget the rest of the world. Online lives can be liberating, but they also can consume you. Do you ever browse Facebook photos of people you barely know? If so, you're not alone. Following people's lives online is something most of us do. It's also the source of a great deal of stress. Nineteen-year-old Chris says that “online stalking” has become routine for him and his peers. His friends upload photos to Facebook, and label and tag people in them. This makes it very easy for others to follow what they’re doing and who they’re with. Chris looks at photos of girls he finds attractive, and learns a lot about them through their online profiles. Are they popular? Do they have boyfriends? What are their interests? At the same time, Chris feels apprehensive as he knows other people do the same to him. Anything he does might end up online for everyone to see, which makes him anxious. However, even though he doesn't like the idea of being “stalked,” he can't stop himself from stalking others. The permanence of our actions online is another source of stress. Anything you do online can and will be permanently recorded. A lot of people police themselves heavily when using the internet, because they're afraid anything they say could come back to haunt them. Teenaged Brad is very wary of the internet for this reason. He never posts anything spontaneously, but chooses his words carefully. He wants to present himself as a calm, resolved and responsible person. Brad, and many others just like him, don't feel comfortable just “being themselves” online. Do you ever wish you could just get away from technology, if even for a short time? It’s not an uncommon thought. Some people go on self-imposed “media fasts” so they have to reach out to others via phone or even person-to-person, the “old-fashioned” way. Sometimes we do need a break from the always-on pressures of the internet. When Brad gets too stressed by online social responsibilities, he goes off networking sites and socializes in person instead. He calls friends, and makes dates to meet in cafes or at home. Brad feels that turning away from social media like this means “sacrificing three hollow conversations [online] in favor of one really nice social interaction with one person.” He says this kind of social interaction makes life more meaningful. Others get away from technology by deliberately leaving their phones at home. Young people, even though they use social media voraciously, do value their private time, too. Pattie has decided not to carry her cell phone anymore, saying, “It feels good to have people not reach you.” Another advantage of being less connected is that we're not always able to immediately receive bad news. Bad news can be particularly damaging if we hear it when alone, without the support of friends or family. For example, Hillary was thankful her family couldn't call her immediately when her father suffered a seizure. She was alone, and might have panicked. Instead, she got the news when she arrived home, where her family was there to comfort her and explain the situation properly. Being connected undoubtedly has its perks, but sometimes we forget that turning off our devices can be beneficial as well. The key message in this book: Technology is supposed to enrich our lives, but it often makes us lonelier. Robots and other new technologies are replacing some of our relationships, instead of enhancing them. This can be stressful, especially for children and the elderly, so many people are backing away from technology and trying to reconnect on a human level. Actionable advice: Feeling overwhelmed? Leave your phone at home. You don't have to carry your phone with you all the time. Knowing that it could ring at any moment is stressful, so leave it behind when you want to relax. Don't feel guilty – you deserve some personal time to yourself.

As a result, German Chancellor Angela Merkel changed her previously positive view of nuclear power to one of outright distrust almost overnight. This disaster was the most recent in the history of nuclear power. Such accidents, as rare as they are, are sufficiently horrific to change public opinion irrevocably. Nuclear power was once seen as an energy source that held the key to a greener future. After Fukushima, however, this is no longer the case. Through exploring the history of atomic energy, you’ll discover how decades of development have led society toward safer ground and more stable ways of harnessing nuclear power. Given the relatively short history of nuclear experimentation, the years ahead just might bring us into a new nuclear era, completely free of nuclear fears. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a decade of technology determined the fate of Fukushima’s two plants; why human error played a huge part in the Chernobyl meltdown; and how 300 years, not 30,000, could be the new “safe” number for nuclear waste. At the end of the nineteenth century, Nikola Tesla accidently discovered radiation. Then, in 1896, after more research and experimentation, Wilhelm Rontgen published the first paper on radiation. Soon, scientists around the world were researching this new phenomenon. Scientists Marie and Pierre Curie soon discovered a radioactive element that they named radium. Yet underneath the excitement, radiation held a dark secret: it was mortally dangerous. The pioneers of radiation research were not aware of its pernicious effects. They would all suffer, in one way or another, from the negative effects of radiation. Tesla’s health deteriorated after repeated exposure to radiation. An assistant of Thomas Edison’s died from overexposure; Pierre Curie was weakened from prolonged exposure to radioactive materials. While new medical applications for radiation were discovered, because people didn’t yet know how truly dangerous it could be, those using these new methods didn’t take sufficient precautions. X-ray machines became a widely used diagnostic tool, yet technicians, exposed on a daily basis, suffered from leukemia and cataracts. Today medical professionals use appropriate precautions to protect themselves from excess radiation exposure. Despite the health risks, radiation still offered many exciting solutions. Radium therapy, in which tumors are exposed to radium, became one of the few effective treatments against cancer at the time. The “healing power” of radiation, however, was a popular idea and one that foolhardy entrepreneurs tried to cash in on, often with tragic consequences. Businessman William Bailey created a “medicine” that was essentially water enriched with small quantities of radioactive materials. His tonic, “Radithor,” was popular until people started getting sick. Millionaire Eben McBurney Byers, who had consumed large quantities of the tonic, suffered from weakening bones, so much so that his jaw almost completely deteriorated. Such tragedies changed the public perception of radiation, and are the source of modern society’s fear of the phenomenon. But those fears would only deepen as scientists explored a further use of radiation – the nuclear bomb. By the late 1930s, the public was well aware of the dangers of radiation and its potential to kill. But despite the risks, the campaign to build an atomic bomb was seen by advocates as a way to end World War II with a minimum of casualties. Although the United States was the first country to build a bomb, German scientists were close behind. US scientists worked in secret laboratories in Washington State and New Mexico, and the United States recruited some of the most talented scientists of the time for the project. Many of these men, including Albert Einstein, had fled from Germany’s Nazi regime. In Germany, the Nazis established an atomic program at the University of Leipzig. It was led by Werner Heisenberg, a Nobel Prize winner and one of the few world-class nuclear scientists who had not fled the Nazi regime. But despite the talent of those involved, both groups still suffered fatal accidents in the race for a nuclear bomb. Two US scientists, Harry Daghlian and Louis Alexander Slotin, prepared radioactive material for the bombs yet didn’t take enough safety precautions. As a result, they were exposed to fatal amounts of radiation and were the only US casualties of the atomic bomb campaign. In the other camp, the facilities in Leipzig caught fire while German scientists attempted to induce a nuclear reaction during a test, killing several scientists. In the end, the United States was the first to build an atomic bomb, yet officials really weren’t prepared for the amount of destruction this new weapon would cause. When the bomb was dropped in Japan, scientists were shocked that everything flammable within 12 miles of the drop’s epicenter caught fire. While scientists knew how much damage the released radiation would cause, they underestimated the bomb’s intense thermal energy. Some 83,000 Japanese would die, many from radiation-induced cancer some decades later. During World War II, the destructive potential of nuclear power was demonstrated to its fullest. How would this potential be contained and managed afterward? Looking at the devastation caused in Japan, one would think that today’s nuclear bombs are closely watched, carefully handled and highly protected. But this is not exactly the case. In fact, there have been many accidents involving nuclear bombs. Some 65 cases of incidents with nuclear weapons have been documented to date, and that’s only bombs belonging to the United States. For example, airplanes have accidently dropped nuclear weapons they were carrying, or airplanes with nuclear weapons on board have crashed. For a long time the US military tried to keep such events secret, but several incidents eventually were leaked to the public. Many of these accidents were caused by simple human error, which then triggered a terrible chain of events. Some egregious accidents include a military crew dropping a bomb on a civilian’s home, injuring but not killing a family, and a B-52 bomber crash in Southern Greenland. The particular design of a nuclear bomb intentionally prevents a full-scale nuclear reaction. Indeed, design engineers specifically considered the potential danger of an unintended nuclear detonation before the first US bomb was dropped on Japan in 1945. For a nuclear bomb to cause a nuclear reaction, several different mechanisms have to be activated. Some of these are switched off during exercises or during transportation. But while many accidents thankfully don’t result in a nuclear explosion, these events still leave behind radioactive material that must be cleaned. These stories show that while mistakes with nuclear bombs are unavoidable, robust design can help to avoid catastrophe. Unfortunately, many nuclear power plants don’t follow similar guidelines. In the 1970s, engineers were confident that nuclear power plants could avoid large-scale accidents. Unfortunately, the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 proved them wrong. This catastrophic event took place during a routine safety operation. At the time, no technician with an advanced understanding of nuclear physics was on duty. What’s more, no staff knew how to fully implement the required safety measures in case of an accident. Poor decisions by physicist Anatoly Dyatlov led his staff to commit more errors. He instructed personnel to override the official emergency procedures, which essentially made the meltdown worse. Politics also played a part in the disaster. Soviet engineers worked in isolation from the rest of the world. The Soviet Union was secretive about its technological developments; there was no knowledge sharing with experts from the West, for example. Consequently, the Chernobyl plant itself was built using outdated technology and posed many problems. Its graphite moderated light-water reactor model, for example, had already been scrapped by Western countries. To make matters worse, the Soviets didn’t immediately release news of the reactor meltdown. Until 1986, the government kept any radioactive leaks as classified information, fearing that such details would cause citizens to panic. Not only were the immediate areas around Chernobyl affected, but radioactive matter was spread by wind to neighboring European countries, increasing the levels of radiation in the soil and contaminating vegetation. Yet after Chernobyl, many years passed without a nuclear disaster on a similar scale. Experts perhaps hoped that this was to be the last large nuclear catastrophe of its kind. Even though Japan’s Pacific coast is a hotbed of major earthquakes, officials still deemed this area an appropriate location for two nuclear power plants: Fukushima 1 and Fukushima 2. The disaster in 2011 was inevitable for a number of reasons. The Japanese government, as well as the Tokyo Electric Power Company, ignored scientists’ repeated warnings of a potentially serious earthquake in the region. Also, the company failed to improve a coastal wall to protect the plants in case of a tsunami. While the breakwater along the coast could protect the plants from waves up to 18.7 feet high, the tsunami that followed the 9.0 earthquake were 46 feet high! What’s more, a series of aftershocks impeded efforts to reduce the scale of the meltdown. One of the main reasons that Fukushima 1 failed was age. The plant was built in the 1970s and lacked the latest technological upgrades. Fukushima 2, just seven miles away, was designed in the 1980s; its superior technology helped to prevent a meltdown there. Fukushima 2’s generators are air-cooled, for example, while Fukushima 1’s generators are seawater-cooled. Human error, like with Chernobyl, also played a large role at Fukushima 1. An operator took it upon himself to override a computerized safety mechanism that monitored the cooling of the power plant. It’s likely that the meltdown could have been avoided had this automatic trigger not been interrupted. One seemingly minor decision caused a chain reaction which exacerbated an already crisis situation, making disaster inevitable. In the 1950s, Admiral Hyman Rickover of the US Navy designed a small-scale power plant to power nuclear submarines. His design would in time come to dominate the civil nuclear industry. Why was this the case? First, Rickover’s design was both efficient and robust. The challenge of designing within the restrictive conditions of a submarine inspired the admiral to come up with new ideas. His plant generated more fuel than it burned, for one; it also didn’t use liquid sodium, which could leak dangerously. Rickover’s successful submarine design inspired civil industry to adopt a similar design. Almost all nuclear power plants operating today are based on some variation of the Rickover plant. There have been other promising designs, yet market conditions and a lack of investment have prevented these ideas from being realized. For example, the direct contact reactor (DCR) was a promising alternative to the Rickover design. The goal of the DCR was to be highly efficient; its fuel was molten plutonium. By the 1960s, a mockup was constructed in Los Alamos. Yet at that time, the government’s budget for experimental reactors was pulled and the project was never realized. Engineers also experimented with a molten salt reactor. This reactor used thorium, a radioactive metal that both exists in large quantities in nature and isn’t fissile – that is, it won’t split and start a nuclear reaction on its own. This makes thorium more stable than plutonium or uranium, for example. Crucially, radioactive waste from thorium is no longer dangerous after 300 years, whereas the waste from uranium fission remains dangerous for some 30,000 years! The project ran for four years but was then abandoned as the Rickover reactor had by then dominated civil markets. In sum, it would be unfortunate to stop exploring alternative methods to better produce nuclear energy. The potential dangers of nuclear power will always be with us. Yet nuclear disasters will become less and less probable as technology improves, and engineers learn from past mistakes. The key message in this book: Nuclear power can be volatile and potentially dangerous. Yet from a history of nuclear mistakes and fatal consequences, we can learn and thus reduce the probability of future disasters. The world’s engineers continue to seek ways of harnessing the wonders of nuclear power to benefit the economy and society without damaging the environment or our way of life. Got feedback?

Burns","summary":"Freeways choked with traffic; car crashes happening every minute; life-threatening pollution and the sprawling blight of parking lots – our addiction to automobiles is a kind of madness. And this is before we’ve taken into account the far-reaching consequences of fossil fuel dependence, from wars in the Middle East to a catastrophic climate crisis. But it doesn’t have to be like this. A future of clean, self-driving vehicles is on the horizon, where we’ll be able to summon a ride at the touch of an app. We’ll relax as we whizz along in comfort, safe in the knowledge that we’re not polluting the planet – and we’ll never have to worry about parking, mile-long traffic jams or human error at the wheel again. In the following blinks, you’ll discover what transport might look like in a few decades, after the internal combustion engine has been relegated to museums. And you’ll see how brave, wild, nerdy people – from a group of roboticists competing in the desert, to the superpowers of Silicon Valley and General Motors – brought this future closer to us. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a freezing university campus inspired a dream of automation; what a robot called Minerva contributed to the future; and how Detroit and Silicon Valley were polar opposites.  Listen to your surroundings for a moment. Unless you’re deep in the countryside, out at sea or on a desert island, you’ll most likely hear the vr-vr-vroom of an automobile’s internal combustion engine. It’s an invention that has transformed the modern world, choking it with exhaust fumes and filling it with noise pollution. And given this high cost, you might be surprised to learn that the internal combustion engine and the gas-guzzling vehicles it powers use energy very inefficiently.  Less than 30 percent of the energy from the gasoline that goes into your car is used to drive it along the road. The remainder is wasted as heat or used to power accessories like headlights, radios and air conditioners. Then, because the average vehicle weighs about 3,000 pounds and the average person weighs about 150 pounds, only a meager 5 percent of the gasoline energy converted into motion is used to move the driver. And gas-powered vehicles use space inefficiently, too. Think of those traffic jams that snake on for miles, whole cities brought to a standstill by swarms of rush-hour cars. The average speed in congested cities, according to the US Department of Transportation, can be as low as 12 mph, which is highly fuel-inefficient. It's especially shocking when you realize that most of those cars aren't even full! The average occupancy in vehicles is just 1.1 people on a daily work commute. For cars with enough room for at least five adults, that's a highly uneconomical use of space. And as we use our vehicles just 5 percent of the time, we have to find a place to store them for the other 95 percent. So, we dedicate large parts of our homes to garages and driveways. And our workplaces, our shopping centers and sports stadiums have to build enormous parking lots, too – paving over huge expanses of land that could be used for valuable real estate or left to nature. We create “asphalt heat islands” that increase urban temperatures, and are even thought to contribute to climate change. All of this adds up to a giant, damaging waste of energy and space. So, the question isn’t “Why would we want to do away with cars as we use them today?” – it’s, “why wouldn’t we?”  Many of our great inventions are born out of frustration and despair – from early humans in the dark forest striking flints together to make fire, to scientists testing the modern vaccines that have prevented so much suffering.  Larry Page’s dream of a world without people driving fossil-fuel-guzzling machines is no different. Page would become CEO of Google and the founder of its self-driving car project, Chauffeur. And it was a very personal sense of frustration that inspired him to dream.  Studying at the University of Michigan, Page didn’t own a car. Though pleasant in the summer months, the isolated university campus would turn into a hostile place during the winter months. It was dark by 05:00 p.m., bitterly cold outside and the streets were filled with sleet, slush and black ice. In this frigid environment, Page would have to catch the bus back to his lodgings. He would watch from the bus stop as others passed him by in their cars, snug in their cocoons of warmth. They wouldn’t pass by quickly, though – so many at the university relied on vehicles that traffic often slowed down to a crawl. Freezing, Larry Page began to dream of an alternative world, with rapid transportation systems featuring two-person mobility pods that could be summoned at a moment’s notice. Long before he developed the world-changing search engine that made his name, it was automated vehicles that fired his imagination. For the author, it was a dramatic worldwide event that led him to think of an alternative. On a trip to Frankfurt as General Motors’s corporate president of research, development and planning, he was called back to his hotel to receive some news. As he got back inside, he was ushered into a conference room to watch the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Over the coming days – badly shaken-up, like most Americans – he reflected hard and concluded that, because the United States depended on oil imported from the Middle East, the auto industry bore some blame for what had happened. The attack had been a consequence of a long chain of events going back to that essential fact. At that moment, he decided that the ever-growing use of gas-powered combustion engines was deeply irresponsible. And he resolved that it was his duty to instigate change. As the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, American soldiers often lost their lives to improvised explosive devices planted under the roads. Keen to avoid these deaths, US generals instead began to consider transporting supplies with automated vehicles.  To this end, an arm of the US government, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, decided that they would stage an automated vehicle race that any American team could enter. With a prize of 1 million dollars, they hoped to accelerate innovation. The great race would be held in the Mojave Desert, with the track stretching 150 miles from Barstow, California to Primm, Nevada. The prize would go to the first team whose robot could finish in under ten hours. In the months before the race, it became apparent that the team to beat was the Red Team, from Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon University. The team was led by a rugged roboticist called Red Whittaker and included PhD candidate Chris Urmson and a motley crew of volunteers from the local tech community. Together they worked on turning an old Humvee into a robot. They tested the robot around an old steel mill in Pittsburgh, fitting it with Light Detection and Ranging Devices (or LIDAR) and GPS tracking. After grueling experimentation and many setbacks, their Humvee, “Sandstorm,” was ready for the race. On the morning of March 13, 2004, the race began. Other robots rolled out of their starting chutes; an automated motorcycle shot out from the starting line and tipped straight over; another drove into a concrete barrier. “Sandstorm” went a short way, hit a hay bale, then continued on for 7.3 miles before getting stuck on the raised shoulder of a road and burning out one of its tires. Its race was over, to the bitter disappointment of the team. It was a huge anticlimax. But rather than ending things there, DARPA’s director, Tony Tether, took to the stage and announced a second race in a year’s time, this time with a prize of 2 million dollars.  Though this race had felt like a let-down to the contestants, what actually happened was that, as they competed, the engineers and roboticists had made great technical leaps to make workable automated vehicles. The sweat and tears of these early struggles would pay off in the future, as we’ll see in the next blink. With professional computer scientists and amateurs both struggling to build robots that could travel long distances across the desert, many vital innovations were made. The first one involves a German computer scientist named Sebastian Thrun, who was working on Stanford University’s entry into the competition. After studying for his PhD in Germany, he moved to Pittsburgh to work as a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. While he was there, in the 1990s, he was involved in a project to develop a robot museum guide for Washington’s Smithsonian Museum. Naming the robot “Minerva,” he gave it a pair of camera lenses for eyes and a red mouth that could frown with displeasure. But underneath the robot’s comical appearance was some serious technical innovation. As the museum was crowded with visitors and held many valuable exhibits, the robot would have to avoid bumping into obstacles. So, Thrun fixed it with laser range-finders and a machine-learning algorithm and sent it out onto the empty museum floor at night. The robot would then carefully map and log its surroundings. To avoid humans, it would assume that any new obstacle was to be avoided, and would stop safely. Using very similar technology, the Stanford team’s robot, “Stanley,” won the second DARPA race, which took place on October 8, 2005, along the California/Nevada state line. And subsequently, Thrun’s focus on terrain mapping and software expertise would solve a vital piece of the puzzle for automated vehicles. Then, Red Whittaker’s team – whom we met in the previous blink – hit upon another vital innovation. This was the “shake and shimmy” method. When their robot encountered a problematic scenario, where it couldn’t be sure about the terrain or an approaching obstacle, it would stop, slowly reverse and crawl forward, until it found its bearings. Like someone with double vision, it did this to reassess the scenario. Then it could return to its usual operation. Again, the ramifications this would have for safety in future automated driving became clear. All of these innovations wouldn’t have happened without the pressure of the races, which forced productive mistakes on the different teams. And many of these people, like Chris Urmson and Sebastian Thrun, who would both go on to work on Google’s Chauffeur project, would play critical roles in the future of automation. Henry Ford’s standardization of automobile production in the early twentieth century heralded the era of personal car ownership. For many Americans, owning a car would become a statement of national identity and personal freedom. Without Ford and his innovations in automobile production, modern America wouldn’t be the same – geographically, technologically or culturally. And, of course, the center of mass-produced automobiles in America was Detroit: a gritty, industrial powerhouse of a city. Following Ford’s rich engineering legacy, Detroit’s auto manufacturers focused on automobiles’ “hardware” – the nuts and bolts, pistons and chassis. For ages, car manufacturing in Detroit meant oily production lines and soldering irons.  American industry and car manufacturing were synonymous for a long time, and when a few forward thinkers began to discuss automated vehicles and computers, Detroit’s auto manufacturers sneered and forgot about the idea. But those forward thinkers continued innovating, in a place that couldn’t have been more different from Detroit: the tech-obsessed computing haven of Silicon Valley. Rather than overall-wearing mechanics, it was a place of computer scientists – people more comfortable coding in air-conditioned labs than stuck under the hood of a car. Silicon Valley’s specialization was software, and it was software that would be at the heart of the new automated vehicles by Google and Tesla, in the way they mapped and navigated their terrain. While there was a commitment to delivering traditional automobiles in Detroit, Silicon Valley had a more experimental air. Like Stanford’s Sebastian Thrun or Google’s Larry Page, people here were open to new ways of solving the problems of fossil-fuel-guzzling vehicles. One example illustrates the difference between the two places. In a TV commercial for Detroit’s Fiat Chrysler in 2011, the narrator says: “Cars that park themselves. An unmanned car driven by a search-engine company.” Then there’s a pause, before the narrator says, “We’ve seen that movie. It ends with robots harvesting our bodies for energy.” However, despite this rivalry, the journey to automation is more complicated than a simple binary. Without Detroit’s legacy, the very idea of personal mobility wouldn’t have shaped the American psyche as it did. And in the mid-2000s, the two worlds, the old one of hardware and the new one of software, met. That’s when Detroit’s General Motors, led by the author, pushed forward the development of alternative-propulsion vehicles and catalyzed the automation revolution. Read on to see how. By 2005, GM had invested in the research and development of alternative-propulsion vehicles in earnest. These prototypes generated electricity with their hydrogen-powered fuel cells – water vapor being their sole emission. And it was at this time that the author, who was GM’s corporate president of research, experienced something of an epiphany, one that revealed to him the future of the entire automotive industry. One day, Byron McCormick, a lead technician developing GM’s E-Flex Architecture electric vehicle, asked the author to follow him to GM’s Vehicle Assessment Center. This was a massive warehouse, the size of five football fields, where engineers would break down vehicles to their component parts to learn about new advancements in the auto industry. There, McCormick ushered the author into an area divided into three bays. In the first bay, there was a Chevy Malibu, totally disassembled. It was composed of many different parts, from its internal-combustion engine, bumper and radiator, to each individual nut and bolt. In the next bay, there was a more modern car, a Toyota Prius, also deconstructed. It had even more parts. Then, in the final bay, sat the E-Flex Architecture. It was a sleekly minimalistic machine and, compared to the gas-powered vehicles, there was very little to it. The author knew that this would have massive knock-on effects for the whole auto industry. With the older gas-powered vehicles, there were thousands of separate parts, all manufactured by different suppliers. Many of these suppliers have names like Denso, Delphi and Visteon, and they sell their parts to Honda, Volkswagen and Toyota. These are the people who make spark plugs, carburetors, valves, fan belts and pistons. What the author saw here was the future. All of these suppliers would have to adapt – or go out of business. He could see, also, that constructing electric vehicles would require far fewer workers, requiring rarer forms of individual expertise. And because of this, they would be much cheaper to make. And he realized, too, that he was looking at the end of an age for mechanics. If a car’s functioning were to depend more on electronics and less on individual parts, then the future of automotive transportation would belong to software coders. When the author showed these vehicles to General Motors’ CEO, Rick Wagoner, Wagoner made it clear: the innovations in front of him, he said, would put an end to the integrated auto industry as the world had known it.  Ever seen the movie La La Land? The film begins with a scene familiar to many of us today: four lanes of traffic at a standstill on a stretch of freeway. Drivers lean out of their vehicles, bored and hot in the summer afternoon. Future generations will watch this movie and wonder why everyone was trapped like that. The idea of being stuck in traffic for so long will seem alien to them. We’re on the cusp of a change that’ll make scenes like this a thing of the past. First, the whole concept of private car ownership will come to an end. Today, to participate in certain parts of modern society, car ownership is important. For instance, it’s almost impossible to live in the suburbs or the countryside, in most countries, without owning a car. We’ve structured our transportation systems entirely around the private ownership of vehicles. And for some, the car acts as a status symbol. All of this will come to an end. Rather than our own private car, the author says that we’ll summon an autonomous vehicle using an app – just like we do with Uber today. These vehicles will be tailored to seat two people, as we make most journeys alone or with one other person. We’ll then be ferried exactly to where we want to go, bidding goodbye to the vehicle, which we’ll probably never see again. For businesses, the change will be earth-shattering. First off, the cost of long-haul delivery and trucking will decrease by around 50 percent. This will be an enormous boost to productivity, allowing e-commerce to flourish in a way unimaginable before. Think of the many small businesses for whom transit costs mean they have to stick to a tiny, localized market – the world will open up to them. But it won’t all be positive. For the many employees and small business owners who make a living as drivers, this change will be a deeply worrying one. And auto manufacturers will have to transition from selling vehicles to individual customers to operating great fleets of self-driving taxis. There will be unforeseen consequences, too. How will it change our mind-sets? What will the landscape look like? In our best science fiction, we can sometimes imagine that future. In the final blink, we’ll consider this coming world. Meet the Wilkersons. A family of four, with Mary and Thomas, parents of nine-year-old Tommy Jr. and eleven-year-old Tammy. They live in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, in the year 2031. They’re eating breakfast before the daily commute to school and work. The children are playing virtual-reality computer games and texting friends, while their parents swipe through holographic newspapers. Before long, the family must set off on their daily commute. A smartphone buzz alerts them that their ride has arrived, from car-sharing company “Maghicle.” They clamber into a four-seater vehicle, powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Tommy Jr. shouts: “Ride begin!” This commute is unlike the ones that the children’s parents remember doing with their own parents. For a start, as they don’t have to drive, the family can spend some quality time together in the hour-long commute. They play games and look at photographs of their recent holiday, all in air-conditioned comfort. And the ride is smooth, with no jerky stop-start motion. This means that the children can take a last-minute look at homework with their parents, without them all feeling carsick. Outside the car windows, the world looks different, too. Complex algorithms mean that cars keep a safe distance from each other, and traffic flows smoothly, without stopping. There is something dreamlike about the spectacle, like a shoal of fish perfectly harmonized with one another. Crashes have been eliminated – the last accidents were long ago, in the early trial years of automation. And the streets are designed with pedestrians foremost in mind. All of the space that was once dedicated to parking is now comprised of wide, green sidewalks. Rather than parking lots, there are parks, plazas and bustling cafes. At the school, the vehicle pauses at a staging area, and the children get out. Then, on another sidewalk, their parents follow, giving each other a quick kiss goodbye. “See you here at five,” they say. Their vehicle whizzes off on its own, to find its next fare or to wait for another assignment, in a world that is both like and unlike our own. The key message in these blinks: The way we use gas-guzzling vehicles today is akin to madness. They are dangerous, inefficient and environmentally catastrophic. The future belongs to automation – the fruit of a long struggle by roboticists, computer scientists and engineers hailing from both Silicon Valley and the old car manufacturing industry. This future will allow us more freedom and time and will be substantially cheaper, while the new alternative-propulsion engines will reduce our environmental impact. Actionable advice: Use Public Transport If there’s one big takeaway from this book, beyond the future promise of full automation, it’s that we should make far fewer car journeys. So, the next time you need to get from the suburbs to the inner city, or from the airport to downtown, hop on a bus, train or tram. Then, when you’ve done that, lobby your government for better public transport links! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

A home serves a vital purpose to its occupants, who make slight modifications to it over the years. Generations go by and these small changes accumulate. Eventually, the building may become unrecognizable to previous inhabitants. We could appreciate the extent of the changes by comparing the existing building with its old blueprints, and the same is true for language. While English students can generally just about understand the 400-year-old plays of Shakespeare, Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales, written 600 years ago, is almost indecipherable without university-level language courses. The foundations are there, but it’s an entirely new structure.  Centuries might seem like a reasonable timeframe for linguistic change, but a curious thing has happened in the last few decades: English is transforming far more rapidly. Why? Because internet.  Our new online tools for communicating have ushered in a new era of linguistic alteration, where different rules for spelling, grammar and syntax can be coined and popularized in just a few years. In these blinks, we’ll dive deep into internet culture, and spell out the linguistic changes the web has birthed. Along the way, you’ll learn why periods communicate passive aggression; who came up with the acronym “lol”; and why the meme is older than the internet. If we consider writing for a second, most of us think of books, magazines and newspapers. For the vast majority of us, these mediums were how we acquired and sharpened our reading skills. As for actually writing, we usually cut our teeth with school essays and exam papers.  Now, there’s nothing wrong with these mediums, but they all have an important thing in common: they’re all types of formal writing.   Formal writing doesn’t just mean serious political journalism or dense academic articles – it’s any kind of edited prose that emphasizes form, often at the expense of immediate flair and creative flow. This includes self-editing, too: you might not have had the luxury of a copy editor combing through your tenth-grade English essay, but when writing, you were conscious of following the rules of proper spelling, grammar and syntax.  For a long time, the vast majority of what anyone read was formal writing. After all, it costs money to print things with paper and ink – why waste cash on misspelled words and stodgy sentences? But things changed late last century, when the internet and mobile phones arrived. These technologies dramatically expanded the amount of writing in everyday life, making it a day-to-day necessity for ordinary people. Phone calls gradually lost ground to emails and text messages. To reach an audience of thousands, you didn’t need to make it past the scrutiny of an editor anymore – you just needed to start a blog.  And to compose these new daily messages, we used a different style of language: informal writing. This is immediate and unselfconscious writing, untouched by either newspaper editors or our own internal ones. When we text, or converse in internet chat rooms, it’s raw and conversational – just as if we were speaking.  This explosion in informal writing began to change the nature of communication, and even language itself.  Acronyms, for example, are common ways to save space in formal writing – think NASA or NATO. And since the informal writing explosion, acronyms have been repurposed by the masses for the same reason, but with very different results. Today, most people know that “BTW” stands for “by the way,” and “OMG” is shorthand for “oh my god.” In this way, the rules of language are no longer handed down to us from figures of authority, like teachers and dictionary editors. With the internet, we’ve all become involved in crafting new forms of expression. Take a road trip across the United States from east to west. In New York and Washington, you’ll overhear people referring to sugary carbonated drinks as “soda.” Keep driving west, and you’ll hear it called “pop” in the area roughly from Detroit to Utah. Then, arriving in Arizona or California, it’s back to “soda.” Why is this? If this observation fascinates you, you’d probably make a good linguist. They’re interested in why people communicate differently. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, linguists have been coming up with explanations for why language varies and what influences our patterns of expression. And they’ve benefited immensely from the advent of a revolutionary new research tool: the internet. Cyberspace transformed linguistic research in several ways. Before, linguists had to record or transcribe individual conversations for analysis; this was time-consuming, and subjects might change their speaking habits in the presence of a researcher. But today, with a vast supply of social media posts and text messages to analyze, researchers have millions of examples of people speaking informally and organically.  Let’s look at a couple of established linguistic theories for why we speak differently, and then consider how internet linguistics helped strengthen their impact. First, there’s the influence of networks. People pick up language habits from the social groups that surround them, like family or workplace networks. In one study in 1970s Northern Ireland, linguist Lesley Milroy investigated the changing pronunciation of the word “car” into something more like “care.” In one Belfast community still in transition, Milroy found that certain young women were leading this change. These women all worked in the same store out of town, where customers and staff alike were already using the new pronunciation. Milroy’s study raises another important point: the influence of strong and weak ties. These are social science terms designating your relationship to other people – strong for close friends and family members, weak for casual acquaintances. Milroy concluded that having many weak ties led to more linguistic change, because this exposes the speaker to different ways of talking. Strong ties, on the other hand, tend to share much in common linguistically.  In this way, it’s easy to see how the internet supercharges language changes. The web is a bundle of weak ties, with social networks, forums and chat rooms all facilitating contact with people outside your core networks. Twitter, for example, is a primary driver of linguistic change because it encourages you to follow people you don’t already know.  But what types of people use the internet, and when did they first come online? Find out in the next blink. Internet users are surprisingly easy to parcel up into a few categories, and being a member of one group says much about your communication habits.   The first group, Old Internet People, are the most influential in the development of internet language. This relates to what linguist Salikoko Mufwene calls the founder effect, which states that the earliest members of a language group exert a disproportionate influence on its later development.  Old Internet People were the first ones online when the internet was still in its infancy. They’re distinguished by a high level of computer literacy, because getting online in those days required navigating a computer using coded commands and knowledge of a few programming languages. Because accessing the internet required technical expertise, it only attracted those interested in technology, meaning that everyone had something in common. They hung out on platforms which would seem prehistoric to us today: sites like Usenet and software like Internet Relay Chat. Old Internet People developed acronyms like “BTW” for “by the way,” and “FYI” for “for your information.” To convey emotion to each other, they also developed basic emoticons like :-) and :-(. The next groups to come online were Full Internet and Semi Internet People. These logged in during the late 1990s and 2000s, when the internet was becoming accessible and mainstream.  Full Internet People tended to be younger and still in school, discovering the web at the same time as their classmates. And they used it to chat to people they already knew, on services like MSN Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger.   Semi Internet People got online at the same time as Full Internet People, but mostly used the internet for work and other functional tasks, like reading the news. They might maintain real-world relationships online, but are generally more skeptical about electronic communication. They’re often highly skilled in specific programs or tasks, like Photoshop or Microsoft Office. The next two groups online were Pre and Post Internet People. Post Internet People are those too young to remember life without the internet, growing up with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as their default. Pre Internet People are older individuals who resisted going online because the learning curve intimidated them. Soon though, Pre Internet People were forced online when the internet became a necessity of everyday life, for things like applying for a passport or checking the weather. An intriguing example of online communication changing language is that the period has come to signify passive-aggressiveness.  Today, we message each other in chat-style conversations, with messages between two people collected and presented on a single screen. With this format, it became more common to separate clauses not with a period, but with a new message. Over time, ending a message with a period began to convey annoyance or passive aggression. By 2013, even mainstream publications like the New Republic had picked up on this shift. Another custom unique to the internet is using capitals either for EMPHASIS or TO COMMUNICATE THAT YOU’RE SHOUTING. That’s because, when we talk online, many of the tools we use to communicate are lost. When speaking, we emphasize words by articulating them louder, faster or at a higher pitch; when we want to shout, we simply shout. Using capitals as substitutes for these was a way to fill the void in the nuance of our real-life expressions.  And once we look past its disarming grin, even the simple smiley :-) emoticon is pretty complicated. Again, it started as a substitute for something lost in the cyber world: a genuine smile. With text-based messages being more ambiguous than speech, this was a useful way to communicate a message’s true meaning. But nowadays, if your best friend messages you with “you’re a terrible person :-),” she’s using the emoticon for something else: to signal that her message is a joke. A smiley can also tone down the aggression of a message – your boss might text “don’t forget to be on time tomorrow :-)” to gently raise the issue of your recent tardiness. “Lol” also has multiple meanings. Invented by Old Internet Person Wayne Pearson in a chatroom in the 1980s, it originally indicated laughter. But soon “lol” evolved – today, it can be used to signify appreciation of a joke, to defuse an awkward situation or to indicate irony.  The last meaning is important, because irony is notoriously hard to communicate in writing – in speech, we can use changes in pitch or an arched eyebrow. This is a problem that far predates the internet: in 1688, the British natural philosopher John Wilkins proposed using an inverted exclamation mark to indicate irony, but unfortunately it never caught on.  What did catch on, though, was surrounding ironic text with ~sarcasm tildes~, like when you say “I’m ~so~ glad to be at my parents’ house for Christmas.” By adding tildes when they’re not necessary, the writer suggests that the content of a seemingly serious message isn’t so serious after all. The sarcasm tilde might even have gained popularity because it mimics the rising and falling tones of a sarcastic sing-song voice, like when we say “soooo.” We all know a few emoji haters – those who refuse to use the colorful, cartoonish graphics we insert into electronic messages. Perhaps they remember a time before emoji, when we used simple emoticons like :-( in our chats, and they prefer what’s familiar to them. Perhaps it’s because they feel emoji cheapen writing and are afraid that language is increasingly diluted by novel symbols.  But whatever the reason, emoji are a part of pop culture and here to stay. Although invented by Japanese cell phone carrier SoftBank in the 1990s, emoji gained truly global popularity in the 2010s when Apple and Android phones started supporting them. Initially, 608 symbols were offered, but the library quickly expanded. Today, all major phone providers support over 2,800 emoji.  But why did emoji become a universal part of our online language? Well, it links back to the argument in the previous blink. Because writing removes the body from language, many of our communicative tools are lost. Emoji help to fill this void. There are two especially useful ways to think about emoji. First, as emblem gestures. Briefly put, gestures are any physical action you use to communicate your point, like when you hold your hands apart to indicate a fish was “this big.” Theorists define emblem gestures, though, as gestures which have a specific name. For example, every English speaker knows what a wink or a thumbs-up means, and you’ll even find their names and definitions listed in English dictionaries.  The roaring success of emoji is, in part, due to their providing emblem gestures in writing – a place previously lacking them. We now have, on our smartphone keyboards, the power to flip someone off (🖕), wave (👋), wish luck (🤞) and roll our eyes (🙄).  But not all emoji are emblem gestures – some are illustrations. We use these emoji to reinforce the meaning of our messages and illustrate context. Birthday messages are a shining example of this. These days, when we receive “happy birthday” messages from friends, they’re often accompanied by a range of illustrative emoji, like the birthday cake (🎂), balloon (🎈) or gift (🎁). We also often combine these context-dependent emoji with others that have broader meanings, like sparkles (✨) and hearts (❤️). Love them or hate them, emoji filled a gap in our informal writing and added new layers of meaning to our messages. They are colorful representations of our physical world, and add nuance and flair to our chats.  Pessimistic over the impact of technology – and especially TV – on society, the sociologist Ray Oldenburg certainly didn’t have online spaces in mind when he coined the term third place in 1989. Oldenburg used this term to refer to social spaces, distinct from the first place of home and the second place of work. Third places are notable for welcoming atmospheres, which emphasize recreation, relaxation, conversation and playfulness. Oldenburg thought these essential to social life, civic engagement and the democratic process, listing pubs and cafés as primary examples.  And although he wouldn’t see them as such, social media sites are perfect examples of third places.  When we log into the third place of our social network accounts, we see a flow of regulars and newcomers all mixing, communicating and socializing. We glimpse the daily habits of others and keep up to date with major events in our acquaintances’ lives. When we start up conversations with old friends, we no longer need to catch up because we’ve been in the loop. In recent years, social media – and especially Facebook – have become the dominant third place for adolescents to hang out and socialize. Instead of, say, going bowling, an increasing number of teens go online on weekends to chat, post updates and flirt. This affects what teenagers aren’t doing, too – in a surprising reversal, several studies have noticed that post-internet teenagers aren’t having sex or drinking as much as previous generations.  Oldenburg also argued that third places have been crucial in forming the wide, loosely-knit social groups essential to revolutionary movements. He cites the taverns of revolutionary America and European coffee shops in the Enlightenment as key examples of this.  But this only reinforces the argument for social media as a third place. For instance, during the 2011 Arab Spring, which saw numerous pro-democracy uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, Twitter was the key tool for organizing protests and spreading dissent.   Internet forums and online communities are other instances of third places. Reddit, currently the most popular forum on the internet, caters to over 1.2 million different communities, all centered around specific topics, from makeup artistry to 3D printing. These act as third places in the way a pottery class might: at first you go for the content, but after a while you begin to recognize names and faces. Soon, you find yourself also attending for the social aspect. Remarkably, memes have been around longer than the internet. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term in 1976, as a counterpart of the gene. For Dawkins, a meme is a shareable piece of cultural information which survives through social selection.  Defined like this, memes existed long before 1976. The internet scholar Limor Shifman, who specializes in internet memes, highlights a particular graffiti sketch as a classic pre-internet meme. “Kilroy Was Here” features a large-nosed man peeking over a wall, and became extremely popular in Europe during World War II.  But internet memes as we know them today – usually featuring text superimposed onto a digital image – really took off in the early 2000s. Then, a number of sites appeared allowing you to upload an image and quickly add some text. Some of the earliest popular memes, originating on the anonymous forum 4chan in 2005, were lolcats: funny pictures of cats with witty captions attached.  A key feature of many lolcat memes was the purposeful use of incorrect grammar and spelling. This was meant to reflect the poor grasp of English a cat would surely have if it could speak. One lolcat meme, featuring a kitten in a bow tie, was captioned: “I CAN HAS PROM DATE?”  The theme of deliberate linguistic errors was later copied in a particularly successful meme: Doge. Itself a misspelling of “dog,” Doge was based on a photo taken by Japanese teacher Atsuko Sato of her pet Shiba Inu. Typically sporting text scattered randomly around the photo revealing Doge’s inner monologue, the meme was remixed by different subcultures to reflect jokes within their community, always keeping Doge’s distinct linguistic style.  One Doge meme, popular among the gamer community, featured Doge crudely photoshopped into a soldier’s uniform. Using the font from the best-selling shooter franchise Call of Duty, the meme spelled out “Call of Doge” with other text like “wow,” “so pro” and “much tough” spread around the picture.   The enduring popularity of memes doesn’t just lie in their easy creation and distribution. Creating or enjoying a meme usually requires being an insider to a particular community. This reinforces a sense of belonging among members, and draws boundaries around outsiders who don’t get it. From an explosion in informal language to Call of Doge, the internet hasn’t just changed how we communicate – after all, language is constantly evolving –  it has also dramatically quickened the pace of change. The key message in these blinks: The English language is a forever-shifting sand, but the advent of the internet has hastened the pace of transformation. The online world is a perfect place for linguistic innovation, because it’s led to an explosion of informal writing by ordinary people, free from the fear of editors and English teachers. And because many of our communicative tools – like gestures and tone of voice – are lost in writing, people have invented creative new ways to articulate themselves and their intentions. But if electronic messaging constrains us in some ways, it also opens the door to other modes of expression: the use of memes, for example, is an internet-specific way to make in-jokes and feel part of a group.  Got feedback?

Williams","summary":"These days, everyone from finance gurus to conceptual artists is talking about blockchain. Initially devised as a platform for Bitcoin, blockchain went unnoticed for years until technologists realized that its potential far exceeds the realm of cryptocurrencies. Now, the hype around this new technology has amounted to some philosophers calling it the next enlightenment. But what exactly is blockchain? Simply put, blockchain is a digital ledger software that is unhackable and unchangeable. Its distributed technology offers an unprecedented amount of transparency and accountability that poses a threat to traditional intermediary authorities such as banks, businesses, and even governments. If that sounds confusing, don’t worry. In this these blinks, you’ll learn how the technology works, how it’s being applied to business, finance, climate change, and the arts, and what it could mean for the future of society. In these blinks, you’ll learn why blockchains become more secure as more people join them; how blockchain could lead to a fleet of autonomous self-driving cars; and why blockchain is giving people hope for a brighter future. If you look up the definition of blockchain, you’ll learn that it’s a digital ledger, or book in which accounts or monetary transactions are recorded. If that sounds boring, look at it this way: ledgers are the foundations of civilization. Without them, we wouldn’t have been able to build cities or efficient markets. They are the means by which we do everything from keeping track of our finances and demonstrating ownership of a house to verifying our status as citizens. For hundreds of years, the world economy has been based on a ledger system called double-entry bookkeeping. These ledgers have two columns for information: debit and credit. As long as the credit and the debit for a transaction match in both the buyer’s and the seller’s books, that transaction is error-free. In order to establish trust in the system and ensure that a transaction is true and accurate, double-entry accounting requires middlemen. Brokers, bankers or other intermediaries get a fee to certify the legitimacy of transactions. However, history has shown us that this system isn’t always reliable. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, it was revealed that many large corporations, like Enron and Lehman Brothers, had effectively been keeping extra sets of books, which they used to conceal the true nature of their financial operations. For years, these companies were able to manipulate the system to launder vast amounts of money. Ever since the dawn of the Internet, many have hoped that it would bring an end to these kinds of transgressions. But until now, the Internet’s susceptibility to hackers has posed security issues when it comes to large financial transactions. However, the blockchain might change all that. The blockchain was originally created as a platform for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. By tracking every purchase or sale, the blockchain ensures that a digital coin can never be spent twice. Transactions are all online for everyone to see; all you need to join is an Internet connection. In addition to credit and debit, the blockchain has a third column in its digital ledger: verification. This  eliminates the need for intermediaries. Instead, trust is built into the very system. Blockchain technology is already being developed in ways which might revolutionize everything from the way that artists can certify the provenance on their work to the way we value currencies such as the U.S. dollar. It could even eliminate the possibility of tampering or lost ballots when it comes to voting. But how can be sure that this technology is so trustworthy? That’s because unlike other ledgers, the blockchain is unhackable and unalterable. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how it actually works. Picture yourself gazing up into the sky on a clear night. Beams of light link each star to the next, forming a celestial network. That’s what a blockchain looks like: a network of phones, computers and other devices, forming a supercomputer that runs the blockchain. The blockchain system is secured through the construction of linked blocks that represent information. Say you want to record the number of rubber trees in the Amazon rainforest. The data would be entered into a digital collection called a “block.” After a block reaches its capacity it’s ready to be added to the chain of linked blocks, or the “blockchain.” However, before it can be added, the new block must be approved by every node – meaning every device linked to the chain – in a process known as the protocol. That's why blockchain is called a distributed technology: everyone on the chain has equal decision-making power. There are various protocol methods, but the most common one is called “proof of work.” With proof of work, every new block comes with a complex mathematical problem, which must be solved before the block can be added to the chain. This is done by special nodes called miners that compete to solve the problem in order to win Bitcoins. Thanks to proof of work, adding blocks to the chain requires substantial computational resources, which helps prevent malicious actors from manipulating the blockchain. Part of solving the problem generates a cryptographic hash, or a code made up of a long string of numbers and letters. In addition to its own hash, each block contains a timestamp as well as the hash from the previous block, aligning it with the rest of the blockchain. You might be wondering why it’s possible to mine Bitcoins, but not to hack into the blockchain and change a block’s information – to say that someone else’s Bitcoin actually belongs to you, for instance. That’s because changing a single block’s information would render the entire chain’s hashes out of sync and automatically signal a break-in. Not only would hackers have to change the hashes for every block in the chain, but they would also have to do this for every single node, since the blockchain is copied onto every node’s device. The computing power required to achieve such a task increases exponentially with every node added to the chain. In other words, the more nodes there are on a chain, the stronger the chain becomes. Unless you’re a computer programmer, you’ll probably never come across a blockchain code. What you will see and interact with is what blockchain enables - namely, distributed applications, or “dapps.” The potential for these dapps is endless. One example is smart contracts. A smart contract is essentially an automated contract on a blockchain with terms agreed upon by both parties. Once the terms of the contract are carried out, an algorithm delivers the payment in cryptocurrency and documents the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts thus automate bureaucracy, eliminating the need for centralized authorities to verify the transaction. Many dapps already use smart contracts. On Ethereum, a public blockchain that supports smart contracts and uses a cryptocurrency called Ether, you can find dapps that use smart contracts to do things like record the origin of a work of art or time-stamp an idea you have for a film, creating an official document of your intellectual property. Other possibilities for smart contracts require only that we use our imagination. Currently, Uber uses a centralized app to connect drivers with customers and ensure payment. A blockchain dapp equivalent could use smart contracts to enable taxis to connect to customers directly, and bypass any centralized intermediary. Let’s take that one step further. Say that at some point in the near future you buy a self-driving car. Smart contracts could allow you to set the car up to run itself as a taxi 24/7.   If the car is low on gas, for instance, a smart contract between you and the car would be activated, and the car would drive itself to get its tank filled. Similarly, if the car has a flat tire, another smart contract would kick in and the car would drive itself to get the tire fixed. Eventually, your car will have earned enough money to purchase another self-driving car. The second car may then earn enough money to purchase another car all by itself. This process would continue until there was an entire fleet of autonomous taxis functioning without owners. Such a business model is called a DAO, or distributed autonomous organization. We can’t be sure right now whether such a model could be successfully realized. But the mere idea of it goes to show how blockchain offers radical potential. The hype around blockchain might sound familiar to anyone who remembers the utopian ideas surrounding the Internet in the 1990s. Although the Internet did make people more connected, it failed to bring about the egalitarian society that many had hoped for, as corporations like Facebook were quick to monopolize the network for their own growth. However, with blockchain, things may be different. That’s because distributed systems intrinsically shift accessibility and power to the masses. Think of investing. For most of history, it has been exclusive to the elite. Banking fees, credit histories, and limited access have undermined the ability of the lower classes to participate in this lucrative activity. But anyone can join a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meaning anyone can invest with them. Some even envision that cryptocurrencies will overtake the central banking system. That’s something that many people have dismissed, but since the US dollar no longer stands for a tangible asset such as gold, cryptocurrencies are really no less valid than dollars, or in fact any other currency. As more people start valuing cryptocurrencies, the vision of a future free of big banks might not be such a stretch after all. For the time being, the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and the Rockefeller Foundation are all already developing ways for blockchain technology to empower disadvantaged farmers, disenfranchised voters, and underprivileged people without banking access. Blockchain technology itself, of course, has no moral agenda. But the distributed system that it represents encourages a rethinking of hierarchies, creating a more equitable version of capitalism. In the same way that smart contracts could eliminate the need for Uber, blockchain dapps have the potential to enable other kinds of trading, like that around rented accommodation. Instead of paying fees to Airbnb as a central arbitrator, as the owner of a property you could set up a smart contract with a renter that would run the venture for you. Depending on your agreement, if guests overstayed their visit, the smart contract would either lock them out of the house or automatically charge them for a longer stay. This peer-to-peer system would mean a true sharing economy. In one episode of TV series Portlandia, the protagonists Peter and Nance interrogate their waiter about the life of the chicken they are considering ordering. Asking questions such as whether the chicken had any friends, the show pokes fun at the rising demand for transparency about where our products are coming from. In the future, you might be able to check your turkey’s journey from farm to table on your phone. Cargill, the company that owns the brand The Honeysuckle White, has already tested a blockchain dapp that lets people track exactly where their turkeys on Thanksgiving came from. This is not the only way in which blockchain is paving a way for a future of unprecedented transparency. Fura, Everledger and DeBeers are three companies devising blockchains to avert blood-diamond trafficking. With the technology, once the certification for a conflict-free diamond is entered onto the blockchain, it follows that diamond all the way up the supply chain, as its location is updated at each step. Not only would this mean that buyers could recognise and refuse blood diamonds at the point of purchase, it would also enable diamond miners to track where their stones end up, and even give them a chance to communicate with people at the top of the supply chain. In that system, the diamond miner would be just as important as the buyer at the top of the supply chain, and would have a real voice to influence how the system is run. At the same time as making transparency possible, blockchains also enable unparalleled privacy. Intimate is a dapp that enables pornography vendors and sex workers to offer their services using cryptocurrency and anonymous addresses. The dapp enables users to keep their identities private while making their reputation recognizable across the platform, making conditions for all participants safer. Up until this point, we’ve been discussing public blockchains. But some blockchains are private, invitation-only platforms. This kind of maximum privacy is essential for businesses, such as health care operators, that deal with confidential information, but it’s also being embraced by businesses in general. Computer behemoth IBM has already engaged private blockchains for major business operations using the Hyperledger Fabric framework, and other corporations are sure to follow. Still, the fact that corporations might opt out of transparency won’t affect blockchain’s utopian promise; the public chains will remain under the control of the public. As we’ve seen, blockchain has the potential to affect issues ranging from farming to investment opportunities. But here’s the catch: as of yet, blockchain networks require an extortionate amount of energy. This is especially true for the Bitcoin proof-of-work protocol. When Bitcoin was first released, you could mine coins from your desktop computer. Today, there is so much competition on the Bitcoin blockchain that it requires an assembly of computers drawing large amounts of energy. The business is so lucrative that professional bitcoin mining farms have been set up around the world. All this means that on some days the bitcoin network requires as much energy as the entire country of Denmark. That being said, for most blockchain applications, proof of work isn’t the most efficient way of authenticating new blocks for the blockchain. One example is the Ethereum blockchain. It has been experimenting with a “proof of stake” protocol, which does without mining entirely. Rather, nodes called validators place a stake or bet that they will be given the next block to validate. If they do catch the next block, they gain a financial reward. The hope is that such alternatives will reduce blockchain energy consumption levels as well as make transactions faster. Looking at the problem from another angle, there are many ways in which blockchain technology could become a tool in the quest for climate change solutions. One environmental application for blockchain is in the carbon-trading market. By turning carbon emissions into a tradable good, carbon-trading markets provide a financial incentive to offset air pollution. Beijing-based Energy Blockchain Lab, working with IBM, has already used the open-source Hyperledger blockchain to develop a new, more efficient platform for carbon asset trading in China. Another green use of blockchains could be the use of a reliable and transparent ledger to track greenhouse gas emissions. This would be essential to monitoring the progress made by nations pledged to the carbon reduction targets of the 2016 Paris Agreement. Blockchain could also be used to track endangered species, make the ultimate destination of donated funds more transparent, and certify land ownership to counter deforestation. The possibilities are endless. It’s up to us to embrace this new technology and continue to think of creative ways in which blockchain could make the world a better place. The key message in these blinks: Blockchain is so much more than Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Computer scientists are pushing this unhackable, distributed digital ledger technology to do everything from revolutionizing business to tackling climate change. While the actual uses of the technology will depend on the groups and individuals who use it, it intrinsically encourages an unprecedented degree of transparency, as well as challenging the inequalities inherent in traditional hierarchical systems.

What to read next: Digital Gold, by Nathaniel Popper As you’ve just learned, blockchain was a by-product of the invention of Bitcoin. But there’s more to the story of that cryptocurrency than the elusive engineer who developed it. Until recently, however, the details of Bitcoin’s sudden rise have been largely confined to obscure forums on the internet. In Digital Gold, Nathaniel Popper tells the untold history of Bitcoin. While its value skyrocketed from zero to $1 billion, Bitcoin’s early days were marked by difficulties. To learn how cypherpunks, gamblers, visionaries, nerds, and investors were behind the rise of the world’s leading cryptocurrency, we highly recommend the blinks to Digital Gold.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

It seems like we’re more vulnerable than ever before and, in the following blinks, you’ll find out why many states, despite their immense military resources, consistently lose battles to small cells of terrorists. You’ll also discover why the safe life that nation states provide today is totally dependent on a number of systems that could topple like dominoes if struck on the right spot. Finally, you’ll also come to understand why terrorists can’t be stopped by undermining civil liberties and trampling on the privacy of citizens. For the past four hundred years, most wars have been fought between two or more nation-states for control of a geographic area. In such conflicts, the largest states with the biggest military capacities tended to prevail. But with the advent of nuclear weapons and the growing global interconnectedness of the world, larger states no longer dominate warfare so overwhelmingly. Since nuclear weapons were developed in the mid-twentieth century, it has become increasingly unlikely for two developed nations to come into direct conflict. This is due to the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, according to which no state with nuclear weapons can be attacked without the attacker also being devastated in a matter of hours. Large armies became essentially useless in the shadow of these weapons. Secondly, nation-states have become more interconnected through trade, among other things, meaning that any conflict would hurt their economies. At the same time international bodies like the UN work to uphold peace by refusing to legitimize most conflicts, further decreasing the value of large armies. Another factor decreasing the advantage of countries with large armies is the trend toward proxy wars, which are not fought by the actual states, but by proxies such as guerrillas. Both large and small states have waged proxy wars when they could not directly engage each other. For example, the United States used guerrillas to fight against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, while Iran and Syria used Hezbollah terrorist proxies to bomb a US Marine barracks in Lebanon. Guerilla warfare means avoiding large battles in favor of small-scale attacks that wear down the enemy gradually, negating the advantage of large armies, which can be bled dry this way. Over the past half century, the advantage of large nation-states in warfare has been gradually eroded to the point that large armies in theaters, like Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, have struggled greatly against guerillas. Ever since the concept was first established in the treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the sovereign nation state has been the most powerful entity in global society. States have asserted control over their economies, security, people and communications, while crushing possible rivals for this control, like religions, tribal loyalties and empires. But the emergence of new technologies has begun to erode the power of the state. The most obvious example of this is the internet, where people can share ideas openly and buy goods and services from almost anywhere on the planet. This means states can no longer control their economies or their citizens’ access to new ideas. The consequence of such new technologies is a decline in the power of nation-states. Consider, for example, the realm of security: protecting citizens from attacks has always been a priority for nation-states. But today, new technologies have led to sophisticated and powerful terrorist and insurgent networks that are hard to uncover and have the potential for inflicting enormous damage. To stop such ever-present threats, the state would need to dedicate huge amounts of its resources to security: resources it doesn’t have. To make up for this gap, the private sector is increasingly charged with providing security services which can be seen, for example, in the number of private security firms contracted in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect politicians and businesses. The nation-states’ inability to provide security for their own citizens is clear evidence of their eroding power caused by new technologies. The weakening power and security problems of the nation-state can be seen in its constant struggle to keep terrorists, drug cartels and international gangs at bay. This phenomenon is likely to continue. Across the globe, various criminal groups are likely to continue gaining power. These groups can have many forms, including terrorists and insurgents, as well as international gangs engaging in human smuggling, counterfeit goods, drugs and so forth. These groups are known as global guerillas.  They’re able to thrive because of the huge and growing global black market, currently worth between $1 and $3 trillion, and growing at seven times the rate of the legal economy. This expansion is fuelled by new technologies like the internet, which greatly eases cross-border trade. Although each global guerrilla group has their own separate agenda, they do occasionally share a goal and can work together. One of the main desires of the vast majority of these groups is to undermine the state. In the past, this goal meant taking over and replacing the current state power, but that’s not the aim anymore today. Instead, global guerrillas want the state to fail because a non-functioning infrastructure gives them a rich array of opportunities: weak or failed states provide terrorists and insurgents with a constant stream of disillusioned supporters, and their feeble public institutions and laws allow criminals to thrive. Often, the groups want to totally destroy the entity of the nation-state. This can be seen with Al-Qaeda, which wants to destroy all the nation-states in the Middle East and replace them with an Islamic empire. Across the globe, the nation-state is increasingly under attack from global guerrillas who aim to hollow it out. In the following blinks, you’ll discover what tactics global guerrillas are using in their battle against the nation-state and how successful these strategies are. In 2004, Iraqi insurgents decided to sabotage an oil pipeline in their country. After careful planning, they proceeded to blast a hole into it, creating an enormous oil spill. It took the authorities in Iraq a week to fix the pipeline, by which time the oil lost had cost the struggling Iraqi economy over $500 million in export revenues. The mission had cost the insurgents a mere thousand dollars, so their effective return on investment was an astounding multiple of 250,000. This is a prime example of a tactic increasingly used by global guerillas: systems disruption. Systems disruption involves deliberately targeting key points in the processes vital for a society. This does not necessarily mean oil, but could also be areas like transport, electricity and communication networks. Rather than trying to maximize casualties, which was their previous tactic, systems disruption allows the groups to inflict the most damage on their target states with the least cost to themselves.  This tactic is so effective because states depend on interconnected systems. The electricity network, for instance, is interconnected to many other systems like the transport and communication systems. Such interconnected systems are vulnerable to collapse because there’s a point in the entire system which, if destroyed, will bring the whole system down with it. This is what’s known as the systempunkt. And once it’s knocked out, it will unleash a so-called cascade of failure, a chain reaction that destroys all the other systempunkts, too. This was illustrated by the Iraqi insurgents’ operation: by punching a single hole in the pipeline, they brought the entire Iraqi oil industry to a standstill. Even such small operations, if carefully targeted, can paralyze entire states and undermine their credibility in the eyes of their citizens. Over the past decade, the development of software has been greatly accelerated through the use of open-source networks. In such networks, one person or group may develop a piece of software and then share it with other people so they can also work on improving it. An example of this is Apache, a dominant web server developed by hordes of programmers collaborating through open source networks. Just like software designers, such open-source networks are also increasingly used by global guerillas to share and develop their tactics. This is known as open-source warfare (OSW), where potential tactics, targets, weapons and so forth are openly discussed between various groups, with each group testing, improving on and sharing successful ideas. This is made possible by the internet, where global guerrillas from all over the world can share ideas and form mutual strategies. The emergence of OSW has made it very difficult to stop global guerillas because the networks can easily contain hundreds of people and are constantly evolving. In the past, security services could stop terror cells by infiltrating them or removing their leadership, but OSW means that there is no clear group leader to kill, and any information gained through infiltration will rapidly become obsolete. For example, in 2006, US forces killed the Iraqi insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and celebrated this operation as a crucial step in defeating the insurgency. But due to OSW – it wasn’t. While Al-Zarqawi had been an important commander in the early stages of the insurgency, by 2006, the group had already moved on and no longer needed overall commanders. Al-Zarqawi had become a mere figurehead and his death stopped nothing. After coalition forces invaded Iraq and overthrew Saddam Hussein’s regime, an insurgency against the occupying forces and the new government of Iraq ensued. Though official figures suggested that between one and three thousand insurgents were being killed or captured each month, the insurgency continued. How could they do this with such losses? To understand this phenomenon, it’s first important to look at an analogy from the realm of business, where globalization and the internet have revolutionized the way that markets work. For example, consider that a typical large bookstore in the US carries about 130,000 titles, while a global online bookstore like Amazon carries more than a million. The difference has a huge effect, as Amazon generates over 50 percent of its book sales from the “niche” titles outside the 130,000 that regular bookstores carry. This illustrates the fact that, due to globalization and the internet, markets now have long tails, i.e., it isn’t a few dominant products that capture the majority of the market, but numerous less-dominant products that share it. Similar long tail effects can be seen in insurgency and warfare too: instead of just a few dominant groups, there are many tiny groups and factions spreading their message over the internet, seeking supporters and sharing ideas. So instead of facing just a few large homogenous terrorist groups, society must now deal with countless tiny ones. The insurgency in Iraq is a prime example of this. At the height of the insurgency, there were at least 75 separate groups of insurgents, each operating based on their own ideals, e.g., loyalty to Saddam Hussein, or for tribal or religious beliefs. Each group occupied its own niche, but they all worked toward their common goal of fighting coalition forces. This splintered nature of the groups explains why coalition forces kept being attacked by insurgents, no matter how good the numbers looked. There were always more insurgent groups ready to fight even if one was knocked down. In the following blinks, you’ll learn what society must do to prevent global guerrillas from succeeding and destroying our way of life. The nation-state has long provided security for its citizens through centralized bodies like the military, the police and security services. Today, however, this method is becoming less and less effective. That’s because the threats we face change constantly and it’s difficult for our existing security systems to keep up. It seems we’re always one step behind the global guerillas, learning from previous attacks but never anticipating the next ones. This phenomenon is similar to the black swan concept presented by Nassim Nicholas Taleb: we have a tendency to trick ourselves into thinking we can predict enormous, unexpected events, and thus are always completely surprised by such inherently unpredictable events. For example, no US government agency was prepared for the September 11 attacks, and if they had been, the attacks would have been stopped. Nevertheless, in the aftermath, people began to feel that the attacks were predictable and so security measures in airports were tightened in an effort to prepare for future attacks. But the next attack probably won’t be like 9/11 because, as we’ve learned, systems disruption will be a more likely tactic. In the face of flexible and adaptable global guerrilla groups, security agencies have started to resort to highly questionable and unworkable tactics. Some people feel that many nations are turning into police states as security agencies tighten their grip to combat terrorist and criminal organizations. For example, the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA) analyzes the personal data of individuals, both domestically and internationally, while its other agencies have been reported to use “enhanced interrogation techniques” and torture. Such legally and ethically questionable tactics do nothing to stop terrorists, but they do hurt the legitimacy of the state, especially in nations like the US that pride themselves on being moral leaders. These developments demonstrate that we can no longer rely on the state to keep us safe. We must look for new strategies, especially in terms of keeping our vital societal systems safe. As we have seen, today’s society is too inflexible and interconnected to effectively deal with the threat of global guerillas who can inflict massive damage with little cost to themselves. Fortunately, there is a remedy: decentralizing our vital systems. This would make them more robust in the face of an attack. Currently, we don’t know where the next attack will come from, and we cannot hope to protect all our vital systems from system disruption. If, however, we decentralize the systems, separating them and making them more independent, any attack will be less destructive, as it won’t be able to cause a cascade of failures. Using platforms is one example of how this can be achieved. These are tools that allow many people two-way access to a system so they can act both as users and producers in the system. The internet is a prime example of a platform where people can produce and upload software, or download software made by others. Let’s take a look at the electricity grid, one of society’s vital systems. This principle can be applied by, for example, allowing all users to input power from their own source, most likely from solar panels. The soaring number of producers would make the network far more robust, as knocking out one producer would only have a negligible impact. This kind of decentralization would stop systems from collapsing even if we have no idea what the target of the next attack will be. The main message of this book is: The future threats nation-states face will take advantage of our dependence on highly complex and interdependent systems. At the moment, terrorists and criminals can cause immense damage by targeting such systems at a low cost to themselves. And the nation-state, the entity which we have relied on to combat threats to our security, is simply too inflexible and weak to do the job. In the future, to combat the increased flexibility and decentralized nature of criminal groups, we must become more fluid and autonomous ourselves.  Actionable advice: Be careful of which economy you are contributing to. Across the globe, the black market economy is growing rapidly. And participating in this illegal economy, whether by buying drugs or counterfeit clothing, can help finance the very groups that threaten our society. Consider that the 2004 attacks on the transport network in Madrid were funded by the sale of ecstasy and hashish: a harsh reminder of what you may be contributing to if you are considering dealing in the black market. Don’t take vital systems for granted – be prepared for their disruption. Our society is heavily dependent on certain networks, like the electricity, transport and communication networks. Many of us take these systems for granted, thinking they will always be there. But, in fact, these systems will increasingly be the targets of attacks, so we should ensure that we are prepared to survive and thrive without them.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Can a network get too big for its own good? The answer to these questions and more lie in this book. The author also explains how a network’s size measures up to its quality and how, oddly enough, the human brain actually gets smarter as it loses capacity. The book also explores what happens when we apply this knowledge about organic networks to technical networks, such as the internet. Although it has grown tremendously over the last two decades, the internet’s growth may finally be hitting a decline. If so, we’ll enter a period where, like our brains, the internet shrinks but gets smarter – maybe even smart enough to act like a brain itself, capable of intelligence and consciousness. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a relatively stupid ant can build a complex nest, why Google is like a brain and why a termite beats a dinosaur. Do you ever feel like you want to abandon your life and civilization and move to a secluded desert island? Tempted as we are by such thoughts at times, isolation isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.    After all, species that live in networks, i.e., organized communities characterized by the division of labor and support systems for one another, are much more successful than those that don’t. A whopping 99.9 percent of all the species that have ever lived are now extinct, but the ones that have survived  continuously and been the most populous tend to be networking or “social” species, such as bees, ants and humans. And although only a small minority – 3 to 5 percent ­– of all species are social, they play a dominant role across all habitats on land. Why are social species so much more successful than those that aren’t? Because the collective intelligence of a network is far greater than an individual’s intelligence. In other words, combining our varying skills and abilities clearly works better than going alone. Let’s use an analogy: the individual ingredients of a cake – eggs, flour, baking powder, etc. – taste anywhere from average to disgusting on their own. But if you mix them the right way, you create a delicious cake. Or consider the ant. Although not the most intelligent of Earth’s creatures – its brain has a mere 250,000 brain cells versus a frog’s 16 million – it can achieve a lot in a network, building complex nests and creating rudimentary agriculture and public health systems. Feeling less into the idea of leaving your life behind and going into isolation yet? Every network, whether an ant colony or human brain – which is a network of neurons – goes through three stages of development. The first is growth. Once a network is founded, its growth will go slowly at first and then suddenly spike upwards. The human brain, for example, develops at an astounding speed in the womb: fetuses create 250,000 brain cells a minute. This explosion happens as the network attempts to consume all the resources that surround it: because if it doesn’t use the resources, something else will. After a period of growth, a network will enter its second stage of development: the breakpoint. Growth will continue until a point when it’s no longer beneficial for the network – this limit is the breakpoint. But a network’s growth doesn’t just gradually come to a halt: the only way to identify the breakpoint is to exceed it. Ever wonder how we know what temperature bread needs to be baked at? The simple answer is trial and error: somebody somewhere burned loaf after loaf of bread before figuring out the limit. Once a system realizes that it’s gone beyond its limit, it goes through a pruning process. To use the ant example again, once an ant colony becomes too congested, fertile ants will be sent out of the colony to reproduce elsewhere. The third and final stage of a network is equilibrium. When successful networks reach their breakpoint, they undergo a small decline in size – and this decline continues until they reach their ideal size, i.e., their equilibrium. This size will vary depending on the environment: a sea slug’s brain only needs 18,000 neurons to function while a cat’s needs 1 trillion. Size isn’t everything. Just think about the dinosaurs: despite their massiveness, they succumbed to extinction while much smaller species, such as insects, spiders and rodents, survived. And the same holds true of networks. A tiny network is pretty useless – just imagine a colony of termites with only two or three members. There has to be a certain amount of growth in a network to get it to an optimal size . Yet a network that’s too large can also be a disadvantage. Once a network has reached equilibrium, additional growth is not helpful and can even be dangerous. For example, our brains have grown to a size where they consume 20 percent of all our energy. If it were to grow larger and our hearts and lungs were to stay the size they are now, our brains would soon run out of nutrients and oxygen, and we’d die. Once a network has reached equilibrium, it will concentrate more on quality than quantity. When we’re five years old, our brains have 1,000 trillion neural connections – too many, as a matter of fact. As we age, our brains get rid of many of these connections until we’re left with 100 trillion as an adult. By eliminating the useless connections, the brain strengthens the ones we use most often and it becomes more efficient. So after it reaches a point where growth is no longer necessary, the brain becomes more efficient rather than just looking for ways to grow. This development in quality is what makes networks, such as the brain and the ant colony, truly intelligent. In conclusion, growth and expansion are very important for efficient networks – but beyond the breakpoint, quality is more crucial for success. What are the secrets of a successful network? First off, self-organization and decentralized leadership are vital for a successful network. The best networks, whether an ant colony or the internet, don’t require centralized leadership. There might be a queen in a colony of ants, for example, but her role is to lay eggs, not to micromanage what everybody does. The colony is self-organized in that every ant knows what they need to do with little instruction from a central power. Wikipedia is a great example of an incredibly successful network with no overall leader or controller. Based on crowd-sourced material, the site is growing at such a rapid pace that it now contains 22 million articles in 285 languages, much more than all the well-known printed encyclopedias (e.g., Britannica, Cambridge, Americana) combined. Second, communication is at the heart of every successful network, as the members of any given network need to be able to pass on information to each other. Ant colonies, for example, communicate via pheromones. The task that each of them decide to carry out is based on information they receive from other ants. Similarly, human beings use language to communicate information about the division of labor and other vital interactions and things. As a matter of fact, language is so important to us that Sigmund Freud once declared: “The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization.” That’s because, ultimately, the self-organization of a network is largely possible thanks to an effective means of communication among its members. We’ve already seen how an organic network develops and what it needs to be successful. Now let’s see to what extent the internet lives up to its definition as a network. Well, first there was a phase of rapid growth: in 1993, there were no websites; in 2002, there were 20 million; and in 2012, there were 600 million. This is an unbelievable amount of growth in just under two decades. How unbelievable? If we were to apply this growth rate to that of a newborn baby, the baby would be so tall at the age of ten that it would be able to touch the moon! The internet has already reached its breakpoint. This is due in no small part to the fact that there is too much content and too many websites on the internet for it to be user-friendly.   Indeed, the amount of people using their PCs to surf the net is shrinking. In 2012, there were 4 percent fewer people browsing the web on their computers than the previous year. The amount of time people are spending on the net is also decreasing: in 2011, it was 72 minutes per day and in 2012 it was only 70. People have instead moved on to using the simpler, quicker and more user-friendly apps. Another limit to the web is energy consumption. Estimates show that the internet will eventually consume 20 percent of the world’s power – a drain so huge that it could either collapse the grid or force it to grow so much that it accelerates climate change. The web needs to slow down to reach equilibrium. If it manages to hit this point, it’ll start improving its quality and become more meaningful for society. Just what can the network of the web help us achieve? In order to answer that question, let’s turn to the rather strong similarities between the human brain and the internet. Just look at a search engine like Google. When you enter a search term, the engine chooses the result based on the importance of a website, which is “directly proportional to how many other websites link to it … and not just the number of the links but also the quality of those links.” This process resembles the way our brain searches. Our most important neurons are linked to the most other neurons. When we want to recall information, the most linked neurons become active first, just as the most linked websites appear at the top of Google’s results list. In the future, the link between our brain and the internet will probably get stronger. For instance, at the moment, we’re the ones who ask the internet what we want via a search. But one day, the internet may be able to predict what we want before we need to ask. This could be made possible by directly connecting the brain to computers. Scientists have already connected a computer to the brain of a paralyzed woman. When she wants to move a robotic arm or switch something on, she can tell the computer to do it with her mind. To help computers go a step further, we need to give them real “intelligence.” If we were to do this, we could make the knowledge of the internet a link to our own brain. With time we’re getting closer and closer to achieving this. A computer called Spaun as already been endowed with a similar neural network to our own. If we ever get there, the internet will become – like the brain and the ant colony – a truly intelligent network. The key message in this book: Networks are some of the most powerful entities on earth. To get to their optimum level they must go through three stages; growth, breakpoint and equilibrium. At the moment, the internet is reaching breakpoint. When it hits it and proceeds to reach equilibrium, it will become one of the most phenomenal networks on Earth. Actionable advice: Don’t kill that ant. If you look at the sheer complexity and intelligence of an ant colony, you’ll start to see the small creatures in a new light.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Massive companies such as Google, Facebook, PayPal, Uber, Amazon and Apple are considered as some of the best places to work, in large part due to their push for more progressive work environments. But are those tech companies really progressive? Undeniably, the number of male employees far exceeds the number of female ones. This is the new norm. And upon closer examination, the work cultures in these companies seem to have been created to service men and feed the “bro” mentality. This is not good. As you’ll see, male-dominated workplaces have serious implications for business success and society as a whole. In these blinks, you’ll find out what influenced the tech industry to hire antisocial men; how many women held computer science degrees in the 80s compared to today; and how much gets invested in male-led companies in comparison to female-led ones. What does a typical computer programmer look like? The first image that comes to mind is probably a nerdy-looking man who’s terrible in social situations but excellent at dealing with numbers. This stereotype, however, is in massive contrast to the reality of the early days of computing. During the first part of the twentieth century, working with computers was considered a clerical job – like typing or operating a switchboard – and thus deemed “women’s work.” In other words, the first computer programmers were women. It should come as no surprise to learn that women programmed the first computer for the US Army during WWII. Or that rear admiral Grace Hopper – who held a PhD in mathematics – programmed Mark I, a computer at Harvard University which helped in the development of the atomic bombs that would be dropped on Japan in 1945. Another thing that many people don’t know is that astronaut John Glenn’s successful orbit of the earth in 1962 was made possible by the work of three female NASA mathematicians. The lack of recognition for their contribution inspired the 2016 film Hidden Figures. Then, in 1967, an article titled “The Computer Girls” was published in Cosmopolitan magazine. The piece contained an interview with Hopper, who compared programming to organizing a dinner party. She said that women made good programmers because of their patience and attention to detail. But sometime in the 1960s came a report that claimed men were better suited to programming. Unsurprisingly, the report was written by two men, psychologists William Cannon and Dallis Perry, who were hired by a software company to characterize the perfect computer programmer. Of the 1,378 programmers they interviewed, only 186 were female. After their research, Cannon and Perry concluded one key trait was that they “didn’t like people.” By connecting good programming skills with antisocial behavior and introversion, the ideal employee was more likely to be male on account of men being three times more likely to receive the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Since the release of that report, the industry was persuaded to hire antisocial men. Their dominance in the field has led to the false assumption that the majority of programmers should be men. By the time commercialized computers entered the market in the 1980s, the male nerd stereotype was firmly established within society. Before we dig into that, however, let’s first look at when men started taking over the technology industry. Two things happened in the late 1960s: the technology industry started to gain traction, and women programmers were replaced by men. Around this time, the technology industry was growing, and computing was gradually being recognized as an intellectual job. As a product of the times, intellect was considered a male, and not female, trait. As we’ll see, boys were more likely to be in contact with computers. And as computer science courses grew in popularity, male college applicants were more experienced and confident in admission tests than their female counterparts. The male dominance of computing degrees can still be seen today. In 1984 about 40% of computer science degrees were held by women, compared to 18% in 2011. This was because computers started to be perceived as “boys’ toys.” A study of high school children found no distinction between pre-existing computer skills in girls and boys. But since the industry was becoming dominated by men, in large part due to the report by Cannon and Perry, computers became a guy thing. This stereotype was perpetuated by toy manufacturers, teachers, parents and children themselves. By the 1980s, when computers first entered the household, girls were afforded even less exposure. Computers were typically a present for sons, and video games were predominantly targeted toward young boys. What’s more, the male-dominated computer stereotype started to infiltrate pop culture. Films from that era, such as Weird Science, WarGames and Revenge of the Nerds, all shared the narrative of the nerdy boy winning over attractive and passive women with impressive computing skills. Of the few women who ended up in the tech industry, despite never-ending discouragement from parents, teachers and peers, not many stayed for long. The bias against female programmers impacted the number of women in the industry, and by 1995 female college students at Carnegie Mellon University were dropping out of computer science courses at double the rate of men. As you can see, the combined influences of external and internal sources have reverted the tech industry to a male-dominated state. The nerd was the first stereotype to come from the tech industry, but since then others have joined the ranks. The rising popularity of the industry gave rise to the more complimentary term “brogrammer” – a mash-up of “bro” and “programmer.” In combination with the “work hard, play hard” mentality, the tech workplace has become an increasingly unwelcome environment for women. One key piece of evidence for bro culture is that business deals often take place in settings that are uncomfortable and uninviting for women. As crazy as it seems, some meetings take place in hot tubs or at strip clubs. This puts women in a difficult position regarding whether or not to attend. On the one hand, a woman could miss out on, for example, investment opportunities, if she refuses to attend uncomfortable meetings. But on the other hand, if she does attend, she could lose credibility and even risk being objectified or sexually assaulted. To show you just how normalized strip clubs have become in association with business, Yelp employees refer to the Gold Club strip club as “Conference Room G.” The Gold Club is located in Silicon Valley, which, unsurprisingly, has received its fair share of sexual harassment allegations. One such case involves Susan Fowler, a former software engineer at Uber. She reported being propositioned by her boss on her very first day – a claim that HR dismissed as a simple misunderstanding. In 2017, Fowler detailed her experiences on a blog, giving rise to the scrutinization of the entire tech industry’s misconduct concerning female employees. Fowler’s experience highlights the patriarchal structures underpinning the tech industry. This is in stark contrast to the way Silicon Valley sees itself, especially when it comes to sex parties. You might be surprised to hear it, but according to the author, sex parties are very common in Silicon Valley. Because of the idea of a free love, polyamorous culture going mainstream, they’re considered progressive and liberating. The problem is that they’re only considered progressive and liberating by men there. The truth is that they exist to serve male fantasies of dominance while female attendees risk losing respect. This was confirmed by two people: One is a venture capitalist who admitted he probably wouldn't hire a woman he saw at a sex party and the second is a former Google employee who felt she’d become a sexual target once her colleagues found out that she’d attended sex parties. Though there are some prominent women like Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki who’ve made it in tech, their success stories are often regarded as chance opportunities. But when a man succeeds in the tech industry, it is credited to his ability. Women are unfairly considered less competent than men. Just consider how women’s quality of work is doubted much more than work done by men. For instance, women are asked to check their coding more frequently. This is unwarranted. A study by the open-source coding community GitHub even revealed that, when the coder’s gender is withheld, women’s work is approved more often than men’s. Another injustice is that male-led companies receive more financial backing from venture capitalists than female-led ones. In 2016, Fortune magazine reported that investments worth $58 billion went to male-founded businesses. Compare that to the $1.46 billion invested in female-founded ones. The tech industry is structured in a way that suits single men over married people, and especially over mothers. Large corporations such as Google promote a blend of work and social life by providing meals, exercise classes, haircuts and beer-filled fridges to their employees. And until recently, Uber used to serve their evening meal at 8:15 p.m. These workplace structures present a clear indication of when employees are expected to knock off, with an obvious disregard for families waiting at home. Not only is parenthood of little concern to these tech companies, but when you’re a mother, the unfair expectations are even greater. Janica Alvarez, CEO of breast pump company Naya, is often asked by investors how she’ll be able to take care of her children while meeting work demands. Her business partner – who’s also her husband – has never faced such a question. The exclusionary nature of the tech world makes it hard for women to break into it, let alone progress in their careers. In the following blink, we’ll take a deeper look into why there are so few female tech employees. Let’s get one thing clear: Silicon Valley is not conspiring to keep women away. There are, however, some hiring practices that perpetuate the prioritization of men over women. First, though Silicon Valley purports to be based on meritocracy, that’s not actually the case. For example, PayPal was proud of hiring based on merit, even though during its early days the staff consisted mainly of founder Peter Thiel’s friends and acquaintances. Paypal believed that businesses should hire individuals with conforming ideologies. The problem is, if PayPal believes that it selects employees based on merit, while at the same time supporting conformity, then they’ll perceive their non-diverse staff of white, educated men as being the best there is. Furthermore, these false beliefs prevent them from recognizing any biases that need addressing. That said, it is very difficult to change a culture once the status quo has been established. If men make up the majority of staff, then when it comes to referring other employees, they’re likely to call upon other men. In order to help avoid this employee mitosis, diversity advisor Joelle Emerson suggests that companies hire a head of HR to target diversity before there are more than 50 employees. Or, simply follow in Pinterest’s footsteps, which worked to increase diversity by asking for referrals specifically from underrepresented groups. The more mainstream culture marginalizes groups, the harder it is for those groups to be able to – or even want to – enter the industry. The rise of bro culture has gotten so out of hand that Christa Quarles, now the CEO of online restaurant booking service OpenTable, was taken to a strip club during a job interview to see if she would fit in with the culture of the workplace. Not only is this detrimental to the tech employees, but it also has an impact on consumers. If a homogenous group of white men develops a new technology, they’re drastically ill-equipped to consider other perspectives, misogyny and racism possibly attached to their product. Social media platforms are a good example of this. In 2014, female game developers and journalists spoke up about the inherent sexism in video games. The women received death and rape threats for their opinions due to a lack of safeguards on online platforms such as Twitter, which was created by four men. It’s pretty clear that women are treated unfairly in the tech world, but with Silicon Valley producing so many successful companies, what’s the incentive for business owners and investors to disturb the way things have been going? One reason is that inclusivity can improve profit margins. Companies that have worked toward eliminating sexism have seen their customer base grow. Ever since the online multiplayer game League of Legends began to suspend abusive gamers and provide them with detailed explanations as to why they were being banned, the number of monthly users has risen from 67 million to 100 million. Women also make up around 70-80 percent of consumer purchases, so it would make business sense to have services targeted toward women. Google employee James Damore complained that women are not biologically wired to be good at programming because they tend to empathize instead of systemize. Damore’s logic here is flawed: empathy is in fact immensely useful when designing services and products since it allows businesses to understand and target customer’s needs and wants. Another argument for gender equality in the workplace is that companies with diverse leaderships report bigger earnings. According to an International Monetary Fund study that looked at 2 million European companies, those with women in 40-60 percent of leadership roles recorded better financial returns. It also suggested that diversity results in higher rates of creativity and critical thinking due to differing perspectives and approaches. Furthermore, companies with a balanced number of males and females were less likely to go out of business because the average woman is more averse to risk. This supposition is backed up by tech investor Roger McNamee, who suggested that gender balance would lead to fewer company failures. Business leaders should think about this. Just because a certain demographic has been successful, it doesn’t mean that other types of people couldn’t help to further increase success. More diversity leads to more success, and it’s time for tech companies to start becoming more welcoming of women.   The key message in these blinks: History and society have both played an influential role in shaping today’s tech industry into a male-dominated world. The task of improving women’s inclusion within the field isn’t easy, but there are clear opportunities and financial benefits for companies that choose to diversify. Got feedback?

This is a shame, because it means that the stories behind these sturdy structures never get told. These stories – of engineering ingenuity, complex calculations, innovative thinking and whip-smart problem solving – are what these blinks set out to tell. Along the way, you’ll get a better grasp of the history of structural engineering, as well as a fuller understanding of the scientific skill and artistry behind the buildings we live and work in, and the incredible structures we snap selfies in front of. In these blinks, you’ll also find out why human poop was once a coveted resource; how to access water in an arid country; and which animal is a good model for a building. On August 27, 1907, high above Canada’s St. Lawrence River, a crew of 86 workers were building the Quebec Bridge. Construction had been underway for four years, but on that fateful afternoon, a large section of the bridge collapsed. The disaster lasted less than 20 seconds, and 75 workers lost their lives. Unfortunately, it’s usually only when something like this happens – when a chief engineer makes a miscalculation and disaster ensues – that structural engineering enters the news. But the triumphs of structural engineering abound. Every intact building is a testament to the deep understanding that engineers have of nature’s forces, and of the stress those forces exert on artificial structures. Broadly speaking, there are two types of force that put stress on structures: compression and tension. When weight is placed on an object, force flows down from the weight, putting the object in compression. For instance, when you stand upright, your legs are in compression, supporting the force exerted by your body weight. In contrast, when weight is hung from an object, force flows down and away from the object, putting it in tension. For example, if you were to pick up a bowling ball, your arm would be in tension. If we were unable to channel these forces, we’d be incapable of building anything. So, early on, we devised systems designed to do just that. Our ancient ancestors certainly knew how to channel compression, even if only intuitively. As far as we can tell, their first structures were single-story mud huts, which made use of the load-bearing system: the weight of the building was channeled down through its thick mud walls, putting them in compression. At some point, our ancestors also learned about tension. Once they gained access to suitable trees, they began building houses by lashing logs together. They’d then seal the structure against the elements by draping animal pelts or woven plants over it. Unlike the mud huts, these structures used the frame system: the weight of the structure was channeled through the logs, which, by pushing against each other, were in tension. Compression and tension, and the two systems we came up with to channel them, have been integral to construction since the first buildings were erected. And they’re no less important today. A great many engineers were first bitten by the building bug as children, and plenty of them experienced the wonders of construction while playing with their first LEGO set. And, really, modern buildings aren’t so different from LEGO constructions: each is composed of a variety of smaller components. Take pretty much any structure, and you’ll find that its frame is made of a network of beams, braces, columns and trusses. Columns are upright pillars, and they’re usually used to channel compression. Ancient Greeks and Romans perfected the use of columns, turning these vertical sections of a structure’s frame into a form of art. Especially impressive are the columns of the Parthenon, in Athens, and those of the Roman Forum, in Rome. Beams are long, solid horizontal supports, usually made of wood, steel or reinforced concrete. They are what’s typically used to form the skeletons of floors and ceilings. When stood upon, or when roofing material is laid across them, they channel the weight out to the columns upon which they rest. The sections of a frame that are neither horizontal nor vertical are referred to as braces, or struts. If a space is too large for beams to span unassisted, then trusses can be employed to give extra stability. Trusses are triangular supportive frameworks composed of columns, beams and struts. They’re more practical than beams, since the component parts are easily transportable and can be put together on-site, and their triangular shape is inherently stable. Trusses are often used in the construction of bridges. For a famous example, take a look at the Golden Gate Bridge. Running its length, you can see a triangular patterning – these are trusses at work. The frames of most structures employ nothing more than these four basic components. But some buildings are so large that they require something extra: a core. You can think of a core as a building’s spine. Cores are typically made of steel or concrete, and they help channel external forces. If strong winds, or any other force, put the building under stress, the centrally located core absorbs it, channeling it down and barely flexing, making the building almost impossible to topple. Other modern buildings take a different approach. Instead of an internal core, they use an external frame. These are called diagrids, or external braced frames. Two famous examples are The Gherkin, in London, and Paris’s Centre Pompidou. Gravity is not a force to be taken lightly, but at least it’s predictable – which is more than one can say about some of the other natural forces that engineers have to deal with. Wind poses an especially tricky problem. For modestly sized structures, wind usually isn’t a major problem. An engineer simply has to measure the building site’s normal wind speed, and take into account a few other things: how far the site is from the ocean, how high it is above sea level and what the surrounding terrain is like. With this, she can accurately calculate the severity of the wind-force. The complications increase exponentially for skyscrapers. Instead of abstract calculations, the engineer must construct a to-scale model of the skyscraper, as well as the surrounding terrain, and then test it in a wind tunnel. Skyscrapers are among the buildings that require a core, but, in some cases, a core isn’t enough to prevent them from swaying in the wind. And so, some supersized buildings use a tuned mass damper. A tuned mass damper is a gigantic pendulum located in a building’s center. When wind hits, the pendulum matches the building’s resonance frequency, swinging in the opposite direction of the building’s sway, and canceling out the wind’s force. The Taipei 101, a 500-meter tower in Taiwan, has an enormous damper; located between the eighty-seventh and ninety-second floors, it weighs 660 tons – and it’s already saved the tower at least once. In 2015, when Typhoon Soudelor hit Taiwan, Taipei 101 remained upright, though its damper recorded 1 meter of movement! But wind isn’t all engineers must contend with; they’ve also got to think about earthquakes, which can be counteracted with other kinds of dampers. To build in an earthquake-prone region, an engineer must do a little research. She’s got to study the frequencies of past quakes, and be sure that the building she’s working on doesn’t have a similar natural frequency, which is measured by determining how many times per second an object vibrates when disturbed. Or, one can mount the structure’s columns on bearings – large rubber pads that absorb a great deal of vibration, thereby alleviating the force of any quakes that might occur. Yet another method is to put dampers between a structure’s columns, beams and braces. For instance, the Torre Mayor, a huge tower in Mexico City, is almost earthquake-proof thanks to a network of hydraulic shock absorbers (96 in total!) arranged in X patterns throughout the building’s frame. On one occasion, a massive 7.6 magnitude quake hit the city. Not only did the Torre Mayor weather it undamaged, but the people inside had no idea that there had even been an earthquake at all! In 1968, in Canning Town, London, Ivy Hodge killed four people by attempting to make a cup of tea. Hodge lived in a high-rise building made of prefabricated concrete blocks, which were held together by nothing more than friction and a small amount of concrete. Unfortunately, on that day in 1968, a defective boiler had been leaking gas into Hodge’s apartment, so when she went to light the stove, there was a small explosion. Though it didn’t even rupture Hodge’s eardrums, the blast blew down her kitchen wall, which had been supporting the panels of the apartment above. These panels promptly collapsed, precipitating the collapse of the panels on the floor below – and the floor below that, and so on until a corner of the high-rise lay in ruin, and four people had been killed in their beds. This tragedy taught engineers some crucial lessons. Indeed, if history weren’t filled with countless collapses, modern engineers wouldn’t be half as good at making such resilient structures today. For starters, all engineers worth their salt know that a structure’s component parts should be firmly affixed to one another, and that it’s of the utmost importance to prevent the disproportionate effect, which refers to when a building has a single point of failure. In fact, one of modern history’s most famous collapses – the fall of the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers – was the result of engineering flaws. Erected in 1973, the Twin Towers each boasted a robust core, made of steel, as well as an external frame that had been specially designed to withstand an airplane collision. However, the planes of 1973 couldn’t hold as much fuel as those of 2001, and the explosions as the planes struck the towers were larger than the original engineers had imagined they’d be – so large, in fact, that the protective paint covering the frame’s steel columns and beams was damaged, along with the gypsum panels that insulated the core against fire. The fire spread quickly, and the heat became extreme. Soon, it was close to 1,000 Celsius, and the unprotected columns began to fail, causing the higher floors to collapse upon the lower. Since this catastrophe, engineers have begun designing towers with stable concrete cores. This provides stability, while also giving people an escape route if disaster strikes. You’ve doubtless seen a brick building. You might even live in one. But did you know that bricks have been around for more than 11,000 years? Back in 9000 BCE, the neolithic inhabitants of Jericho put bricks to extensive use. After molding pieces of clay into rough bricks, they’d let them dry in the sun, after which they’d use them to construct their beehive-shaped domiciles. This was the method until about 2900 BCE, when the people of the Indus Valley began using kilns to fire and harden their bricks. But the brick-making masters of the ancient world were the Romans. They were familiar with the perfect kind of clay, and knew exactly how long a brick should dry for. And they used bricks for everything – especially arches. Arches are ideal for holding up heavy loads by using compression, and bricks proved perfect for arch-building. Sadly, the art of brick-making that the Romans had perfected was lost when the Roman Empire fell in 476 CE. It would be 600 years before such excellent bricks – or such handsome brick arches – were seen again in the West. But it’s not all about the brick; indeed, bricks are nothing without mortar. In ancient Egypt, a gypsum plaster was used to hold bricks together; however, since gypsum dissolves in water over time, it proved an insufficient adhesive. Forced to seek an alternative, the Egyptians devised a mixture of lime mortars that grew stronger as it dried – and could last a long, long time. In ancient China, mortar innovations were also underway. For example, they put sticky rice in the mortar used in the Great Wall, which gave it more “flexibility,” something mortar needs in order not to crack in extreme weather. Metal also has a long history, but it didn’t become a viable construction material until relatively recently. Though the Iron Age began more than 2,200 years ago, it wasn’t until the nineteenth century, when it became possible to mass-produce steel, that buildings started regularly incorporating metal. In 1856, a man named Henry Bessemer discovered a practical method for removing all the impurities from iron. He took a furnace and channeled a current of warm air through it, thus creating an exothermic reaction – and temperatures high enough to incinerate impurities that couldn’t be removed in a coal furnace. After this process, it was easy enough to add a precise measure of carbon to the metal, giving it extra strength – and, voilà, the age of steel had dawned. When Bessemer died in 1898, more than 12 million tons of steel had been produced globally. At first glance, concrete might not seem like a particularly exciting substance. But, without it, some of the world’s most awe-inspiring structures – from Rome’s massive, 2,000-year-old Pantheon to the towering skyscrapers of today – never would have been built. Concrete is a complex whole created from simple parts. Here’s the basic recipe: Take some limestone and clay. Mix thoroughly. Heat mixture to 1,450 Celsius, until it fuses into lumps. Take these lumps and grind them to a powder. This powder is cement. When you add water to the cement, you’ll have a substance that, once dry, is exceedingly strong. If you’re short on cement, you can put in some sand or gravel, which will increase the mixture’s volume without undermining its robustness. And there you have it: concrete. This unassuming substance has some remarkable qualities, and it’s perfect for big construction projects. For starters, thanks to its molecular makeup, concrete can resist an incredible amount of compression – as much as 16 times more than brick. Concrete structures can also be cast as a single piece, so that there are no weak points. Whereas brick structures will always be weaker where the mortar holds them together, concrete structures have the benefit of being uniformly structurally sound. But, despite these pros, there is a “con” in concrete: it’s bad at resisting tension. This was a problem until the 1860s, when a French gardener named Joseph Monier hit upon a solution. Monier’s clay pots had an irritating tendency – they’d often crack. Monier started making pots out of concrete, but he discovered that these did the exact same thing! So he got creative. He took some metal wire and made a sort of lattice. With this, he reinforced his concrete pots – and the result was revolutionary. The ability of the concrete to resist compression, and of the wire to resist tension, added up to a remarkably strong material. In 1867, Monier exhibited his innovation at the Paris Expo, and, to this day, reinforced concrete is still among the most versatile and sturdy construction materials out there. Skyscrapers are inherently symbolic. They’re emblematic of some of humanity’s greatest qualities – our ambition, for instance, and our inexhaustible capacity for innovation. But it’s only in recent times that we’ve actually started constructing buildings as high as our expectations. For almost 4,000 years, the world’s tallest structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza, completed in 2560 BCE, which, at 146 meters tall, was pretty short by today’s standards. Then, starting in the fourteenth century, a series of cathedrals traded the distinction of tallest building, with one cathedral losing it to another whenever its spire snapped off in rough weather. The first skyscraper – Chicago’s Home Insurance Building – wasn’t built until 1884. Since then, our ability to construct enormous structures has increased considerably. The Eiffel Tower, which was completed in 1889, stands at an impressive 300 meters, though it’s dwarfed by today’s tallest building, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, which towers at an astonishing 828 meters. But such height wouldn’t be practicable without elevators – in particular, the safety elevator. Although elevators have been around for millennia (they were used to lift Roman gladiators into the arena of the Colosseum, for instance!), they weren’t very safe until relatively recently. One snapped rope, and serious injury or death could result. This problem was remedied by a man named Elisha Otis, who was once tasked with emptying out a New York warehouse. Fed up with manually moving objects from floor to warehouse floor, Otis came up with a way to do it mechanically. He attached a wagon spring – which lies flat when compressed and bows out when released – to a hinged frame that ran along a notched guide rail. As long as the cable from which the elevator depends remains unbroken, the tension compresses the spring; if the cable breaks, however, the spring bows out, which forces the frame to lock into the notches and the elevator to stop. In 1853, at New York’s World’s Fair, Otis showed his invention, and, less than five years later, the first steam-powered safety elevator was installed. These elevators allowed people to reach ever-higher stories. Today, elevators are used by roughly 7 billion people every 72 hours. Prior to drawing up any blueprints or making any plans, an engineer has to know almost everything about the ground he’ll be building on. If he doesn’t, there can be serious long-term consequences. Take Mexico City, for example, whose historical center has sunk by roughly 10 meters over the course of the last 150 years. The terrain has been problematic for hundreds of years. Indeed, it used to be a lake called Lake Texcoco. In 1325, the Aztecs built a city on an island in this lake and named it Tenochtitlan. To get to Tenochtitlan, you had to walk along one of many clay-and-soil causeways, which were supported by wooden piles and connected the city to the mainland. These causeways were so well built that they still function as Mexico City’s main roads. In the sixteenth century, Spanish conquistadors destroyed the Aztec city and built a city of their own on the foundations of the massive Aztec temples. In the process, they felled all the surrounding trees, which resulted in erosion and frequent floods. When the Spanish decided to expand the city, they caused further problems by filling the lake with soil, which raised the water table (the level at which water flows underground). The problem was that, whenever it rained, there were massive floods. This issue wasn’t solved until the twentieth century, when a series of underground waterways were constructed to carry off the excess water. During all this time, the city continued to sink. The Metropolitan Cathedral is a good example of the general problem. The cathedral’s designers were perfectly aware that such a large structure would soon begin to sink into Mexico City’s soggy soil. So, in 1573, when construction commenced, they first built a gigantic platform known as a raft foundation to support the cathedral. But this plan had a flaw. The soil being built on wasn’t uniformly compact – and so, by 1910, the Metropolitan Cathedral had a pronounced tilt. One corner stood a good 2.4 meters above the other. To correct this worrying tilt, Dr. Efrain Ovando-Shelley constructed a model of the tower, with real soil samples from beneath the cathedral, thus simulating the degree to which the various sections of soil had compressed during the cathedral’s history. Equipped with this data, Ovando-Shelley and his team drilled 32 access shafts. These shafts contained a total of 1,500 extraction holes, each somewhere between 6 and 22 meters long. Through these holes, they removed 4,220 cubic meters of soil. This mostly corrected the tilt, and it should ensure less uneven sinking in the future. Civilizations, like trees, tend to pop up wherever there’s water. But even if there’s no water in sight, structural engineers have ways of finding it. Indeed, creative engineers have been sniffing out water sources for thousands of years. In the middle of Iran, there’s a large, arid plateau surrounded by desert. Back when this region was part of ancient Persia, clean water sources were scarce. This forced Persians to come up with a solution, and the result was a clever construction called a kariz. Building a kariz is a bit of a process. First, you dig a hole into the side of a hill. If you don’t find any damp soil, it’s time to look for a new hill and start digging again. Once you find moisture, you move to the second step, which is to leave a bucket in the damp part of the hole for a few days. If the bucket begins to collect water, that means you’ve found an aquifer – a subterranean repository of water in the rock. The third step is to dig a series of holes down through the hill, creating a line of wells. It’s important that each well is a bit deeper than the one before it, so that when you move on to the fourth step – connecting all these wells by digging a horizontal tunnel between them – the water flows to the hill’s base, where it can be easily reached. Iran contains an estimated 35,000 kariz, and many of them – like the 2,700-year-old kariz in the city of Gonabad, which still provides the city’s 40,000 citizens with water – are still being used today. But you don’t need to live in a desert to have a hard time finding enough potable water. Just consider Singapore, a small island with over 5 million inhabitants. Though surrounded by ocean, the people who live there have never had a secure water source. For a long time, Singapore obtained its water from Malaysia. But Singapore didn’t want to be dependent on another nation, knowing that drought or conflict could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. So Singapore became a water-management leader. Today, Singapore collects 90 percent of its rainwater, more than any other country in the world. It also reuses a great deal of wastewater, and, in 2005, it opened its first desalination plant, which produces 30 million gallons of potable water every day. These innovations alone provide 50 percent of Singapore’s water – by 2060, that percentage should rise to 85. How a culture handles human waste is a pretty good indicator of how advanced that culture is. Japan is a case in point. Back in the Middle Ages, Japanese farmers were short on fertilizer. There wasn’t much livestock on the island, but the human population was increasing and needed food. So, to fertilize their crops, the farmers began using human feces – or, as it was called, “night soil.” And, soon enough, there was a booming market for the stuff. In fact, it became so lucrative to sell poop that laws were passed that made landlords the legal owners of their tenants’ feces. Urine, for better or worse, remained the property of its producer. By the mid-1700s, monopoly rights had been granted to guilds and associations whose sole purpose was to set fair prices for poop. But despite these efforts to enforce fairness, the cost remained unreasonably high – and many farmers risked imprisonment by pilfering poop. Despite its flaws, this system was successful all the way up to the twentieth century, at which point a population boom caused some unpleasant problems: in two-thirds of Japanese cities, the sewage systems were utterly inadequate. London is another city that’s had to deal with more than its fair share of crap – literally. For the majority of London’s history, all human waste – feces, urine, corpses, you name it – was simply thrown into the Thames or one of the smaller rivers flowing into it. Unsurprisingly, waves of unpleasantness resulted from this, including widespread outbreaks of cholera. Eventually, things got so gross that Parliament was forced to take action. In 1858, London experienced an exceedingly hot summer. Its cesspits, all 200,000 of them, as well as the thoroughly befouled Thames, began to cook. A putrid stench soon hung over the entire city. The “Great Stink,” as it became known, drove the House of Commons to act on what had long been proposed: the development of a sewer system. Joseph Bazalgette, the man assigned to design it, devised a network of tunnels, which would run beneath the Thames and its tributaries and carry the city’s waste out to sea, far from the populace. Luckily, Bazalgette anticipated the growth of that population, and also reasoned that no one would want to build a new system in the future. And so he constructed sewers that could handle the waste of roughly 4 million people – twice as many as then lived in the city. In 1875, London’s sewers – 2,100 kilometers of tunnel – were completed. The lives of the people living there have been much better ever since. It’s hard to be a woman in a male-dominated industry. Being a woman and trying to conduct a serious discussion with construction workers who are in the habit of pinning pictures of nude women to the wall is, to say the least, tricky. So it’s important for aspiring female engineers to draw inspiration from the past. Just take Emily Warren Roebling, who, though never trained formally, completed the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, in New York. Emily had always loved engineering. So it was no surprise when she married Washington Roebling, who’d decided to follow in the footsteps of his father, the famous engineer John Augustus Roebling. When Washington went to Europe to study construction techniques, Emily went too and helped with his research. In 1865, the year that Emily and Washington married, John Augustus Roebling was contracted to design and construct a bridge between New York and Brooklyn. Sadly, mere weeks after construction commenced, John Augustus got tetanus and died. So Washington, the obvious successor, assumed the role of head engineer. But yet another tragedy was right around the corner. Washington, who’d been spending lots of time in the pressurized, watertight chambers used to work on the bridge’s foundations, got the bends and had to leave the building site. Luckily, Emily was ready to step up to the plate. She first wrote down all her husband’s instructions and then, worrying that he might not recover, began handling his correspondence and studying advanced mathematics and complex engineering principles. Soon enough, Emily assumed all of Washington’s roles. She worked on-site and communicated directly with the workers. But, despite her stalwart management, the construction encountered problems, and a new chief engineer was almost found to replace Washington. In the end, though, the city allowed Washington to complete the project by proxy – and his proxy, Emily, was there, standing beside President Chester A. Arthur, when the bridge was opened to the public in 1883. You now know a great deal about engineering’s history. But what about its future? Well, as new technologies continue to emerge, it seems to be getting brighter and brighter. Here’s a sampling of some cheaper, modern construction techniques that might start replacing pricy, outdated ones: It costs a lot to build the plywood molds for concrete structures. Indeed, the mold often consumes more of the building’s budget than the building itself, and it’s usually thrown out afterward. An alternative to this wasteful and exorbitant method is using molds made of plastic. Unlike inflexible, plywood molds, plastic molds are pliable, relatively cheap and easily transportable. And since plastic and concrete don’t bond, plastic molds could even be reused. Though this idea was cooked up in the 1950s, it’s only recently started to gain traction. Then there’s 3D printing, which is already opening up new engineering vistas. Thanks to 3D printing, component parts can be produced at much lower prices, and made from recycled materials. It truly does seem like the way of the future. For example, in 2016, a fully 3D-printed pedestrian bridge was completed in Madrid. Another new technology also assisted in the construction of this bridge: robots. In this case, they helped analyze how much weight the bridge could bear. But robots are starting to be used in more mundane construction processes too, such as laying bricks and pouring concrete. Finally, advances in biomimicry are helping us use nature’s ingenious bioengineering to benefit our own buildings. Just take Stuttgart’s Landesgartenschau Exhibition Hall, which is modeled after the skeleton of a sea urchin. Like the urchin, the structure is domed and made up of fitted plates, which, in the structure’s case, are made of plywood sheeting. The resulting structure is both strong and light. Or take Phil Purnell, a professor at the University of Leeds. He’s working on designs for robots that, like the white blood cells in the human body, will analyze weaknesses in infrastructure – along roads, for example, and within utility pipes – so that the necessary repairs can be made. It’s impossible to predict the future of engineering, but one thing is certain: if we continue to innovate, the main limitation on the structures of the future will be our imaginations and ambitions. The key message in this book: The masterpieces of modern architecture are the culmination of thousands of years of building experience. By better understanding this rich history, you can better appreciate the structures around you. Whether it’s calculating the forces that nature will exert on a structure or analyzing the ground on which that structure is to be built, an engineer’s job is far from a simple – or mundane – one. And, for future engineers equipped with unforeseen technologies, it seems that things will only get more exciting.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You may be holding it in your hands; it may be in your pocket or purse; it may be on your desk – and wherever you go, you will doubtless take it with you. The internet and social media are now so pervasive that many of us can’t imagine a day without them. In fact, they shape our whole experience of life – our individuality, our perceptions, our habits. Given this pervasiveness, it may be time to raise a few critical questions. In these blinks, you’ll reflect on how the digital world influences you. You’ll learn how it influences your intellect, how it decouples you from reality and how it can even affect your neuronal functioning. You’ll also learn why turning off the navigation system is the better way to go; how Wikipedia, YouTube and Google hinder you from gaining knowledge; and why you should make time to read a good novel. It’s pretty amazing to think about just how much information is available on the internet. Equally amazing is the fact that, nowadays, the answer to nearly any question is literally at our fingertips. But having all this knowledge so readily available comes at a price. First off, this convenience can make acquiring knowledge through first-hand experience seem less relevant and meaningful, which, in turn, can make life feel less gratifying. Consider GPS. While this tool is very helpful when you find yourself trying to navigate a new city, it also keeps us from becoming familiar with our surroundings. We come to rely on it, instead of maps and our intuition. Prior to the advent of GPS, people studied and interpreted maps and used their imaginations to picture the landscape around them. This allowed you to see for yourself a variety of different routes and how far you needed to travel. You could then immerse yourself in the details so you’d know where you’re going. And when you finally got there, you’d experience a substantial reward that following GPS just doesn’t provide. There’s a sense of gratification that comes with acquiring your own knowledge and putting it to use. The author used to experience this gratification by discovering new music. He would study the liner notes of albums he liked, reading about other artists who played on them, and then search for good radio stations and get recommendations from people he trusted. All of this would take time. But when he finally did hit musical pay dirt, the discovery would feel truly rewarding. And it wasn’t merely gratifying; it made music more personal. The extra work and effort made him feel connected to the musical scenes and artists that were around. In order to feel this kind of gratification, you need to feel like you’ve earned it by working for the knowledge you’ve gained. But this doesn’t happen in today’s digital age, with music services like Spotify and Pandora that just expose you to everything, one click at a time. Having gratifying experiences in life is important. But it’s not all about worldly accomplishments and adventures. Being connected to your inner self is equally important. And with social media providing a constant connection to the outer world, it’s becoming ever more difficult for us to foster internality, a space for self-reflection and self-realization. This is because the need to be connected to the outside world at all times hinders our ability to be self-sufficient. There are any number of instant-messaging apps and social-media platforms that collapse the distance between you and the rest of the world. Many regard this as a great thing, a wonderful gift. But by allowing yourself to be available 24/7, and expecting others to be equally available, you can end up with no time to focus on yourself and your own thoughts. As a result, we’re constantly waiting for responses and looking for approval from others rather than looking inward and finding out what we think. It also becomes harder for us to feel at peace spending time alone or to feel comfortable taking things slowly. Instead, we feel restless, anxiously awaiting feedback from the outside world. This reliance on external approval separates us from our individuality and the real facts of our situation. Many people have become so comfortable living in the digital world that they can’t imagine what it would be like to live without immediate access to the internet. But when you’re constantly in this other world, it’s hard to stay present in the moment, to live in the physical world occupied by your body. These days, when people feel bored, lonely or helpless, they immediately turn to their smartphones. They try to escape these feeling instead of doing the healthy thing, confronting them and attempting to understand where they’re coming from. In other words, people look to their smartphone as an easy fix – an escape hatch from real feelings or personality issues that need to be worked out. Of course, constantly escaping to the digital world creates other problems. After a while, people start to feel a sense of incompleteness and anxiety. It’s not uncommon to hear someone complain about not having time to sit down and read a book these days. And it’s not at all improbable that the rise of the internet and the ubiquity of portable devices are what’s eating up all our time. It takes focused attention to read a book. The internet, in contrast, works by distracting us, by shifting our attention from link to link, giving us little time to think or reflect on a topic. As we’ve gotten in the habit of shifting our attention from one page to the next, our behavior has also started to change. We no longer read with the intent to understand. We rush to get to the next topic by skimming and quickly scrolling through a page. The digital world has kicked us into high gear, leaving us with neither time for ourselves nor time to concentrate. Even when someone is walking from one appointment to the next, he’s likely to be answering an email or quickly scrolling through a news website in an effort to ingest as many stories as possible. As a result, we’ve become satisfied with just reading headlines and highlights. We don’t dive into the full articles and books that offer the information that allows us to think, reflect and form our own opinions. All these digital interruptions and distractions may even be changing our neuronal functions. In 2006, a team of scientists studied the brain behavior of cab drivers and how they were affected by technology. Before taxis were equipped with GPS, cab drivers had to memorize all the streets, routes and alternate routes a city had to offer. And since cabbies had to practice all this memorization, their brains developed a larger-than-average hippocampus, the part of the brain that handles how we remember our geographical environment. So, clearly, our behavior can change our brains – for better or worse. Just as our brains grow when we use them, they stagnate when we don’t. When we constantly distract ourselves from having deep thoughts, we neglect an important part of our brains that can suffer as a result. Another part of our lives that has transformed in the digital age is how we learn. Whether it’s picking up a new skill or finding out about a new subject, there’s a good chance you’ve gone to Wikipedia, YouTube or some other result from a Google search. This isn’t always the best way to learn and become well informed. To learn about a subject on Wikipedia or through a YouTube tutorial is often to strip it of its context.   Let’s say you’ve always wanted to learn more about the French Revolution. The information presented on a Wikipedia page, or any other online-knowledge platform, shouldn’t be taken at face value. Sites like these don’t provide the kind of context that comes from a source that offers a critical and independent point of view. This objective viewpoint comes only from an author who has thoroughly researched the subject from all angles and prepared the information in a comprehensive, thus meaningful, manner. So to really understand the French Revolution and get a full picture, you would need to read multiple books that offer different viewpoints. Unfortunately, the internet simply doesn’t present information this way. Google has a universal library project that hopes to scan and compile every book in the world into one massive cross-referenced database. Having all this data just one click away might seem exciting, but by chopping all these books up into chunks of data that link to one another, the very idea of a “book” is destroyed. A book is no longer a cohesive and independent statement from an author; it’s just a collection of isolated info bits. Further, by combining all this information, the very thing that gives it meaning is removed. There’s no context. We ought to remember that just because we can do something doesn’t mean we should do it. Paper seems to be on the verge of disappearing from our lives. Even textbooks are being digitized and students are using tablets in classes as early as elementary school. But neglecting the printed word is knocking our inner lives off balance. It’s no secret that the publishing industry is struggling. Many publishers are downsizing and only concentrating on books with a built-in audience, and there are fewer book reviews being published than ever. But, most of all, starting at a young age, people are simply reading less and less. However, reading books, especially novels, is one of the best ways to improve your thinking and your intellect. They not only invite us to reflect on and contemplate life; they also spark our imaginations. When you read something that isn’t on a digital screen, it engages your ability to focus and transport yourself into another world. And this allows you to see yourself and your own world with clarity so that you can better understand who you are as an individual and where your emotions come from. There are few things as powerful as a good novel to engage the imagination. But reading a novel takes hard work. You need to give it your full attention. You need to take the author’s words, process them and recognize the intent behind them. Otherwise, your imagination won’t fully engage. Such rigorous reading is challenging in and of itself. It becomes more difficult when you’re reading from a device. The digital world distracts us. It creates a barrier that makes it hard for our imaginations to connect with our intellect, to completely immerse ourselves in the author’s world. So do yourself a favor – put down the device, pick up a book and nourish your mind. The key message in this book: Our involvement with apps and the internet is stronger than ever. We check our email the moment we wake up and stay glued to our screens until we fall asleep. And our constant urge to be digitally connected is diminishing our experiences and deteriorating our ability to focus. If we want to retain our ability to make our own informed decisions and not shy away from dealing with our emotions, we need to put down the smartphone, pick up a book and spend more time reflecting on what it means to be alive.
